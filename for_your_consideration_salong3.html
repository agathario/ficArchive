      Chapter 1: The Roundtable
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was hot. Too hot to be doing this.</p><p>She knew that. She could tell by the way her lungs screamed at her to stop, how her muscles were on the verge of cramping when she’d only been moving properly for twenty minutes or so.</p><p>But this was where Rio Vidal could be fully herself.</p><p>Where she could push herself in ways she couldn’t when all eyes were on her. Everywhere she went. Everything she did.</p><p>Someone always needed something: a selfie, another take, a charming story for a late night show.</p><p>But out on the trails she could be free. The strain and sweat made her feel more alive than the standing ovations received in her broadway debut or the five star reviews of her latest movie.</p><p>But it was this, the hard-hitting drama about a lost cause grifter searching for meaning in all the wrong places, that meant that her peace was shattered as her music switched from heavy drum and bass to something infinitely less welcome.</p><p>A phone call.</p><p>“Alice. What is it? I’m-…”</p><p>“Where the fuck are you? We have to leave in an hour.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio huffed out a heavy breath as she halted her stride and turned her watch over to check her heart rate, paying little attention to the time.</p><p>“I’ll be back soon.”</p><p>“Rio, this is serious. This is a <em>big</em> deal.”</p><p>“Yes, you’ve said.”</p><p>“Look, I know you don’t give a shit about awards but if we can get one then…”</p><p>“And a roundtable with some arrogant actresses is the way to go. Got it.”</p><p>There was a sigh on the other end of the line and Rio felt guilty for a split second. Alice was good at her job and often Rio gave her a harder time than she needed to. But only because she was her best friend before she was her publicist.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll head back now,” she relented before the guilt could fully settle.</p><p>“Hurry,” was all she heard before Alice put the phone down on her.</p><p>And so Rio turned away from her desired route into the foothills and made to run back down the way. But before she could pick back up the pace a couple of walkers just a few feet away caught her eye and Rio groaned internally when they began to flutter at her.</p><p>“Rio? Rio Vidal? Oh my god!”</p><p>Rio smiled and waved, adjusting her stance from ‘about to run’ to ‘nowhere to run’. Pulling her AirPods from her ears she self-consciously wiped her forehead with the back of her forearm and allowed the two to approach, soon realising that they were harmless and wanted a quick selfie rather than a long talk about their favourite movie of hers, or worse, an ill-advised admission that she was on their “lists”.</p><p>She was on a lot of people’s lists.</p><p>She thanked them kindly for their support and felt guilty for the second time that day as she ran off, leaving her fans in her dust behind her.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hated interacting with fans - actually Alice always told her she was too generous with them - but a day like today was not a day where she felt like being fawned over. She had to be top of her game.</p><p>Hence the run. Hence the escape.</p><p>Alice was right. This was a big deal. And the next few months could mean that the rest of her career would never be the same again.</p><p>If she could just play it right, if she could schmooze and charm, and campaign, then maybe she could get a nomination. Maybe she could even win.</p><p>And this roundtable was the start of it.</p><p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> did this annually, ahead of any sort of nominations coming out they’d predict the front runners in each category and invite them to a roundtable where the potential nominees and inevitable winners would be preened and polished before being set out like little dolls at a child’s tea party.</p><p>Rio resented the implication. But she knew it was part of the game.</p><p>Her latest movie was Oscar fodder. She’d known that when she’d signed up. In fact, it was <em>why</em> she’d signed up.</p><p><em>All The Wrong Gods</em> had come out to rave reviews for both Rio and the film itself. It was the first time in her career where the industry was actually paying attention to her rather than her performances being a footnote at the end of reviews: “a standout performance from Vidal manages to elevate an otherwise dire script”, “Vidal adds some life to a two-dimensional character”, “when will someone give Vidal the chance to sink her teeth into a role rather than letting her chew on what’s left”.</p><p>It had taken until her thirty second year to get this kind of recognition, for publications to be bothering Alice night and day for an exclusive interview that didn’t involve questions similar to “how was it working with an all male cast?” Or “was it hard being ‘the straight man’ in a room full of comedians?”.</p><p>And as much as she’d like to let her work speak for itself, she knew that wasn’t how Hollywood worked.</p><p>And so she’d soon be in a room, placed at a table with five other Oscar-hopefuls, all playing the same game with various levels of experience and previous success.</p><p>There was Jessica Dyson, a relative newbie to this game and a rare friendly face in the industry who would be there to speak about her WWII piece: <em>Beneath The Weight Of Sky</em>. Her movie had already debuted at Sundance.</p><p>There would be Sylvia Jones, an old British acting legend who already had two Oscars under her belt and plenty of opinions on the way the industry was going (all negative, all, in Rio’s opinion, racist), bringing with her the weepy drama set inexplicably on a barge (Rio had fallen asleep during this one when she’d had a screener sent to her by the production): <em>Downriver Grace</em>.</p><p>Then there would be Isla McCoy, a younger actress who had racked up more Oscar noms than Rio could count but who she’d met a few times and actually liked, or at least looked forward to speaking to at any and all industry events. Isla was bringing her latest virtuoso performance in a story about a blind violinist in the seventies called: <em>Echoes of Her Hands</em>. Another Sundance release.</p><p>Rio had reached out to Isla when she’d seen the movie telling her how extraordinary her performance was. She’d received an emoji back.</p><p>Next up was the woman Rio most looked forward to seeing. The woman with red hair and a genuine smile and who had turned in a deeply affecting performance in what was otherwise a mess of a movie; Wanda Maximoff for <em>The Vanishing Point</em>.</p><p>But finally, the person Rio always dreaded seeing at any event but who she more than often was able to avoid, was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Agatha was an industry heavyweight.</p><p>Only seven years old than Rio, she’d already secured one Best Actress gong alongside two other nominations and multiple other awards.</p><p>Rio could only guess how stacked her trophy cabinet was.</p><p>Rio already knew that Agatha would win this round again and then she’d be a two-time winner, one of the elite few to obtain such a status.</p><p>Agatha’s latest movie was an intimate portrait of a mother experiencing the loss of a child.</p><p>Rumour had it that this was Agatha’s masterpiece.</p><p>That if she chose to retire now she’d be leaving the world with such a huge gift that the tragedy of her loss to the acting world would almost be forgiven for the magnificence of the gift.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness could hold an audience.</p><p>She could rewire people’s brain chemistry with just a look.</p><p>Her blue eyes contained worlds of emotions Rio could only dream of capturing for a scene or two in every movie she was in.</p><p>But Agatha held them, owned them, ruled them when she worked.</p><p><em>No Heaven Like This</em> was labelled a masterpiece before it had even been properly released. The critics were desperate for it, the audiences were gagging for it, and Rio would be one of the first in line to it.</p><p>Both Rio and Agatha were yet to have their movies debut properly and were waiting on Cannes the next month to have them released to the critics.</p><p>The buzz around them both was already so strong though, so palpable, that they were already the betting man’s favourites to win; hence the invitation to the roundtable, hence the reason Rio’s schedule was full for the next year.</p><p>But as Rio slowed her pace, coming now to the flat of trail, almost reaching her little silver hybrid, she weaved gracefully and expertly through the throngs of people now making their way up the trails in the early morning sun.</p><p>Her mind drifted back to Agatha, the final of the little sextet of actresses all vying for the attentions of the press and the public to get their recognition, and any accolade they could get their greedy hands on.</p><p>But it wasn’t jealousy that led her back to Agatha.</p><p>The sudden phantom feeling of a body against her own. Those blue eyes that held so much, and gave only when she wanted them to, and the feel of warm breath against her lips.</p><p>She’d had plenty of bodies against her own since then, before then.</p><p>But to have Agatha Harkness so close and then to lose her so fast, it was enough to make anyone go crazy.</p><p>She’d met Agatha for the first time eight years ago.</p><p>When Agatha was on the verge of her first nomination and Rio was still a jobbing actress with an improv group in downtown Chicago.</p><p>One of the seniors in the group had somehow arranged for Agatha to stop by one of their shows and Rio had been transfixed by the woman from the moment she’d stepped foot into the little theatre she’d once considered home.</p><p>Anyone who had eyes and ears knew Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And anyone with a brain was a fan.</p><p>Anyone who felt anything for a beautiful woman was in love with her.</p><p>And Rio was no exception to any of these things.</p><p>But Agatha had barely paid her attention all night.</p><p>She’d seen her eyes on her during the show, she was sure of that. She was the talented newcomer of the troupe though so, lots of eyes were on her.</p><p>But in the bar afterwards, she’d barely looked her way, and when she had, she’d always turned just as quickly, as if she’d simply been glancing over and Rio happened to be in the way.</p><p>Only, something strange had happened that night. Rio had got drunk. Too drunk. Which wasn’t that strange.</p><p>She’d been spurred on by a good show, a rowdy cast, and an always encouraging Alice.</p><p>And somewhere between spotting Agatha for the first time in the audience and going home with Alice and on the verge of vomiting, she’d found herself pressed against the inner door of a grimy toilet stall.</p><p>Even eight years later she still wasn’t sure what had happened.</p><p>But she was sure that Agatha had had her hands either side of her head, that their bodies had been so very nearly pressed together, that Agatha’s lips had been a breath away from her own.</p><p>And then it was over before it had begun.</p><p>Someone else entering the bathroom had spooked Agatha and Rio had been left high and dry, all alone in the little stall hornier and more confused than she’d ever been in her life.</p><p>She hadn’t told anyone about this.</p><p>She hadn’t even told Alice for fear her best friend would make fun of her for fantasising about the older, straight actress who had shown absolutely zero interest in her all night.</p><p>It had happened. She was sure of it.</p><p>But back on the Los Angeles trail, Rio lost her footing in the throes of her memories and slipped in the copper dust of the Californian sand.</p><p>She yelped and collapsed onto her side, her ankle sparking up a white hot pain that flashed up her calf.</p><p>“Fuck me, fuck me.”</p><p>That’s what she got for thinking of a married mother of one like that.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness sure as hell didn’t remember one random drunken encounter in a bar all those years ago where nothing technically happened with an actress she barely acknowledged the existence of and probably didn’t even remember the name of.</p><p>And Rio was a fool to even think about it.</p><p>Two burly gentlemen came to Rio’s aid and helped her back to her feet, fussing a little more over Rio Vidal the actress than if she’d been any other random woman tripping over her own feet.</p><p>She soon thanked them and hobbled off to her car, gritting her teeth through the pain of it until she managed to sink into the warm embrace of her five year old Toyota that she refused to give up just because it wasn’t a cool enough car for a cool actress.</p><p>Though Alice had very nearly convinced her to get a sporty little red thing only the previous week.</p><p>The short drive home to her little house in the hills was enough time for her to forget all about her almost-tryst with one of the most famous women in the world.</p><p>And by the time she was back in Alice’s clutches, let alone her bad books, she had lost all sense of what had caused her to fall in the first place.</p><p>“God, for someone so athletic you really are a klutz.”</p><p>“It happens. It’s busy and the trail-…”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes, knowing much better than to get into an argument about this when she was already in trouble. Plus, fighting more would only make them much later.</p><p>In fact, they were so late that Alice was performing a soliloquy on the plans for the day as they moved through the Spanish-style villa that Rio had only recently treated herself to.</p><p>“You can’t just follow me into the shower, you know. HR would have a field day.”</p><p>“I am your HR, and your agent, and your manager and PA and-…”</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Rio sang out even as she threw her sweaty sports bra on the floor and shimmied out of her shorts - all sense of shyness long since gone in their friendship; having shared apartments together of varying sizes and in varying states since their late teens.</p><p>“You need to be on your best behaviour.”</p><p>“I always am,” Rio said with a wink, stepping into the waterfall shower as Alice perched on the counter and kept her gaze down on her phone where no doubt she was answering millions of new emails about Rio, her comments on the film, her personal life, her upcoming projects.</p><p>“No. I mean it. It’s important you nail this. Being late won’t help. You have to charm their pants off. Wanda and Jessica and Isla will be fine. They’re friendly. You have to be respectful of her Ladyship and Agatha. Especially Agatha. She’ll win and you want her to name call you first of ‘her fellow nominees’ in her speech.”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence that lasted the length of Rio lathering up her hair with shampoo before Alice spoke again.</p><p>“Jennifer Kale called earlier.”</p><p>Rio had just put her head back under the water to rinse said shampoo away so wasn’t sure she’d heard correctly. She leant out again and made eyes at Alice through the misty glass partition, seeing her best friend watching her curiously.</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p><p>“Jennifer Kale. Agatha’s-…”</p><p>“Yeah. Why did she call?”</p><p>Alice shrugged slightly and dropped her gaze back to her phone, swinging her legs as she started to type again. “Something about checking in on the competition. I think Agatha’s spooked. You’re the second favourite in the running.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and dipped back into the hot shower, taking her time to rinse out the suds before she leant back out again and said: “It’s just on camera chatting though, right? Schmoozing off-camera isn’t-…”</p><p>“It’s necessary. You schmooze with the best of them. Flirt a little and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>“That’s terrible advice,” Rio said with a huff even as she reached for the conditioner.</p><p>“A little flirt never hurt anyone.”</p><p>Rio would have rolled her eyes if she hadn’t just stuck her head back under the water.</p><p>And she knew she’d have to endure Alice’s pitiful attempts at flirting with Jennifer Kale, whom she’d been smitten with since the first Golden Globes they’d ever attended together two years ago.</p><p>And if Rio were honest, she was pretty sure Jennifer was smitten too. But it wasn’t exactly a relationship she wanted to encourage.</p><p>Not when Jennifer’s boss was the subject of Rio’s most frequent fantasies.</p><p>Soon Alice got bored and was happy enough with the progress Rio was making getting herself clean so she disappeared from the bathroom to give her friend and employer some dignity, finally.</p><p>Rio emerged not ten minutes later into the living room with sopping wet hair and an old sweater over yoga pants. It wasn’t exactly the movie star look Alice would have picked for her.</p><p>“You could at least-…”</p><p>“They pay people to make me look good. An hour in hair and makeup and you won’t recognise me. Relax.”</p><p>Alice huffed and Rio smiled as she grabbed her purse from the couch and jingled her car keys, “Let’s go.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes but hurried after her boss and soon they were on their way to the studio lot where the shoot was to take place.</p><p>They slipped through security with ease, not only because the guard was a fan but also because Alice had all the right identification in place to quicken the process.</p><p>Rio often said that if they wanted to give it all up they’d make a great team of bank robbers: Rio could charm her way in and Alice could work out the rest.</p><p>By the time they were on the set and both hurried to a small trailer where outfit options were hanging patiently on rails for Rio, Rio’s nerves had settled into her stomach.</p><p>It wasn’t that she hated publicity. It was that she <em>hated</em> publicity.</p><p>Speaking to a group of people at a party was no problem.</p><p>Performing to a room using the words that someone else had written for her was a walk in the park.</p><p>But being herself, being her best self, and trying to impress in an environment that just wasn’t normal for anyone, that was a whole different ball game.</p><p>And if Rio knew anything, it was ballgames.</p><p>“Hey, hey, space cadet. Snap out of it,” Alice said urgently as they arrived at the makeup trailer they’d been shown to by a nervous PA.</p><p>“Look, go in there. Switch off for an hour. I’ll pick your outfit. I know what looks good on you. And just relax okay. No coffee. Just water.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and looked down at Alice. Good, kind, fierce Alice who had been by her side for years. She had no idea where she’d be without her and told her this often whenever she was drunk.</p><p>But unfortunately for her she was currently as sober as a nun.</p><p>“You’re the boss,” she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes before she turned to leave, taking a steady breath before pushing the door open to the trailer.</p><p>Inside it was warm and inviting, with bright lighting around each mirror lining the wall that made Rio regret not wearing even a scrap of makeup - but it would have been washed off shortly anyway.</p><p>It smelled somehow familiar and Rio put it down to the floral scents of all the various lotions and potions that would soon be on her face and in her hair.</p><p>In front of her was an empty chair before the large mirror that reflected back at her the fake movie star that was Rio Vidal: fresh-faced and still a little flushed from her earlier run and the rush she’d been in to get here.</p><p>But she didn’t have time for vanity.</p><p>Within seconds, arms were around her and a soft ‘ooooo’ sound was in her ear.</p><p>She instinctively wrapped her arms around the woman who had so excitedly accosted her and blinked as she pulled back to beam at her.</p><p>“Rio! My darling girl! I wondered when you’d show. Come come, sit sit. Work to do, work to do.”</p><p>Rio recognised this woman but had no earthly idea what her name was and so she became biddable and sat in the chair pointed out to her.</p><p>“It’s so good to see you,” she said in her best impression of a person who knew exactly who she was talking to.</p><p>“Oh darling! How long has it been?”</p><p>“I-…” but a slight movement across from her caught her eye and Rio noticed for the first time a pair of blue eyes watching her closely, a glint of amusement clear in them.</p><p>Rio lost all ability to speak. Let alone make up the date of the last time she had seen the enthusiastic woman behind her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was sat primly in her seat, her hair piled on the top of her head in the way that looked purposeful where Rio’s currently looked tragic.</p><p>She had clearly been on her phone, which now lay delicately in her lap.</p><p>Her sweater was cashmere, her jeans expensive, the little boat shoes on her feet surely more than Rio’s entire outfit put together… and probably Alice’s too.</p><p>She had no makeup on yet, at least, had nothing that was obvious to the layman.</p><p>But her skin was glowing, that dewy way that sometimes happened to Rio’s skin when the right people put the right treatment on it.</p><p>It was a movie star glow.</p><p>And Rio hated her for it. Hated that she could look so beautiful, hated that she was so untouchable, so stratospherically famous and <em>good</em> and beautiful that it made Rio feel small in her presence.</p><p>“Perhaps a year ago? On <em>Starlight</em>, must have been.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said slowly, her eyes still on Agatha who was now raising her brows at her as if to ask ‘why are you looking at me’. And that smirk, god, Rio thought, that fucking smirk.</p><p>She tore her eyes away then and turned back to the unnamed woman who seemed to know her so well she was already taking her hair down and finding her parting in her mop of still-damp hair.</p><p>“Must be! How’ve you been?”</p><p>As Rio allowed her head to be turned towards the mirror so Mrs Nameless could do her job, her eyes flickered briefly through the looking glass to see Agatha, still looking at her.</p><p>She felt her body react before her mind could as she still tried to focus in on the details of the woman’s life, what she’d been up to, and why in the goddamn hell she couldn’t remember her name.</p><p>Rio felt hot under Agatha’s gaze, as if she’d been caught doing something she shouldn’t.</p><p>Though Agatha couldn’t know she’d thought about her a hell of a lot over the past eight years.</p><p>Could she?</p><p>Despite her hair currently being fanned out behind her and run through with expert fingers, she tugged a section free and began swirling it around her finger.</p><p>A nervous habit Alice was always telling her to stop doing in interviews.</p><p>This didn’t last long, however, as her unnamed friend stole it back and Rio was left with nothing to siphon her nervous energy into.</p><p>“And you must have met Agatha? Have you worked together?”</p><p>Rio glanced up from where she’d been determinedly staring at her own nose and looked to the woman behind her before briefly glancing towards Agatha.</p><p>“Yes, we’ve met. Just at parties and events.”</p><p>“Never had the privilege of working together though,” Agatha drawled with a sickening smile that Rio took to be dripping in sarcasm and the woman now leaning round her to access whatever bottle of serum she needed made another ‘ooooo’ sound.</p><p>“You should! You’d be fantastic. A twosome like you? You should make it happen. I insist. And hire me too.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha again and saw the smirk she’d heard in her voice before now proudly displayed on her face.</p><p>Sickening.</p><p>But the woman behind her was now tutting, her mind back on her job rather than the wonders Agatha and Rio could work on a movie together.</p><p>“I don’t have-…” she sighed heavily and dropped Rio’s hair where she’d held it in her left hand, “Bear with. I need to go to raid my other stash.”</p><p>“Aggie, darling,” she turned to Agatha and Rio noted that the brunette’s smile had softened in time to not be caught out, “Stay where you are and I’ll send the team to finish what I’ve started, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded but remained silent and turned back to her phone as Rio returned her attention back to herself, attempting to look cool and calm rather than how she felt, which was hot and bothered.</p><p>She heard the door to the little tin can they were in close behind her and a welcome silence descended for all of ten seconds before Agatha spoke.</p><p>“You don’t know her name.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, watching herself do so in the mirror before she turned to look at Agatha in real life.</p><p>The woman was still intent on her phone, her profile passive and her thumbs still moving.</p><p>“Of course I do.”</p><p>“Great. What is it?”</p><p>Rio blanched, her brain kicking up to start rifling through her internal roledex of industry names and job titles.</p><p>She’d worked with so many people over the years that she’d developed a reasonably good memory for names but for some reason this woman had slipped her mind.</p><p>“Are you asking because <em>you</em> don’t know?”</p><p>Fighting back seemed like the only option when she was coming up blank.</p><p>Agatha paused her typing and turned slowly to Rio, watching her for a second before she spoke again: “A little tip for you: learning people’s names comes at no cost to you and it’ll do wonders for your reputation.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw almost fell to the floor.</p><p>How could Agatha Harkness of all people be telling <em>her</em> how to ingratiate herself with the crew?</p><p>Rio had an exemplary reputation. She was always on time, always friendly, always made sure to bring coffee and pastries for early call times. And the one time she forgot a name <em>would</em> be when in the presence of Agatha Harkness, who had a reputation for being less than friendly to most she considered beneath her.</p><p>“Are you fucking-…?”</p><p>But her question was cut off when the door behind her opened and a flurry of people came into the cramped space.</p><p>Rio clamped her mouth shut just as Agatha grinned across at her and Rio saw the dazzle that people spoke about when they talked of Agatha aiming her shine at them.</p><p>It was nauseating, just how effortless it was for her. And Rio felt her cheeks flush a little from the impact of it, and turned her head away to centre herself again.</p><p>Beside her, Agatha was now accepting cheek kisses from the crew members tasked with taming her mane of brunette hair, and Rio felt like a child allowed at the adults’ table for the first time.</p><p>It wasn’t until her own hairdresser came back that she was able to wrangle herself back.</p><p>She focused hard on the conversation happening to and around her. Of this still nameless woman who was working with her assistants to wrestle Rio Vidal the person into Rio Vidal the movie star.</p><p>Where Rio had max three people at a time working on her, Agatha had at least seven, and occasionally one of the assistants working on Rio would flutter over to help the more senior crew members with Agatha’s face and hair.</p><p>She didn’t mind, really. Rio knew that if she were a member of the crew she’d much rather fuss over Agatha Harkness than Rio Vidal. But it was fascinating to watch all the same.</p><p>With the sheer volume of help that Agatha received to be camera ready, the older woman was done before Rio, and much to Rio’s surprise Agatha slipped from her chair and moved towards her.</p><p>Rio was just about able to lift her gaze up, turning her head just an inch or two to look at Agatha where one of the assistants was behind her working on adding soft curls to her hair.</p><p>Fully made up, Agatha looked no more or less beautiful than she had with no makeup on and more than anything Rio felt how unfair that was.</p><p>But then Agatha had done the unexpected and swooped in, a soft hand landing on Rio’s shoulder and her waterfall of long hair blocking the two of them from the rest of the room.</p><p>Rio’s lungs filled suddenly with the familiar scent she’d noticed earlier.</p><p>It was Agatha.</p><p>She wondered why it smelt so familiar, having never really been this close to the woman, unless a drunken mind could remember precisely the perfume of a woman who’d once almost kissed her.</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>But Agatha was leaning in, was smiling as she turned her head and Rio felt the soft warmth of her cheek just graze her own as she murmured into her ear, “It’s Sarah.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched the second the soft words hit the shell of her ear and she forgot herself as she turned her head slightly, making their cheeks brush again and her mind go blank when Agatha pulled back just enough and looked at her with something in her blue eyes that Rio had no capacity in her brain to recognise.</p><p>Agatha didn’t give her time to adjust to the proximity. As soon as it had started, it was done.</p><p>Agatha was moving on and had left the hot little trailer in search of her outfit for the shoot.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, her mind now elsewhere when the people around her spoke to her.</p><p>She wondered if this was how her fans felt about her whenever they ran into her in the street or waited outside theatres or premiers for the chance to get her autograph.</p><p>Surely it was similar.</p><p>Agatha was a beautiful, unknowable movie star. Who wouldn’t be awestruck in her presence? Who wouldn’t be melted down to jelly when near her, when touching her?</p><p>Who wouldn’t now be thinking of the ghost of her breath against her lips?</p><p>The memory that over the years had morphed and changed and transmogrified into sometimes delicious late night fantasies, sometimes idle daydreams, sometimes nightmares of accusations or insults.</p><p>And so Rio shook it off, shook her silly little crush on the Oscar-winning actress off and made herself back into a professional adult who could focus in on a conversation without focusing on the warmth of her cheek that had just been graced with Agatha’s touch.</p><p>By the time Rio’s face was made up and her hair was styled to to look chicly natural, Rio ironically felt much more normal.</p><p>She stood from her seat and hugged the assistant and then the woman she’d spent hours with now, only now knowing her name for the last half of their time together.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal! Think about it, darling!”</p><p>Rio laughed and was determined to absolutely <em>not</em> think about it as she squeezed the woman’s arms.</p><p>“Sarah, always a pleasure. Thank you.”</p><p>The woman blinked at her, her joyful expression fading slowly and then morphing into something else.</p><p>The oxygen was sucked from the room.</p><p>And the soft sound of the radio blasting in the corner even seemed to stutter with static.</p><p>“It’s Grace.”</p><p>Rio could have kicked something.</p><p>Someone.</p><p>The whole room had gone silent and everyone had turned to look at them and Rio felt like the smallest person in the world. But she had no option but to persevere.</p><p>“Oh god, I’m sorry. It’s been a long day. Of course. Grace. Having a moment, I think.”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t as good an actress in real life as she was on screen and Grace clearly didn’t believe her.</p><p>So Rio smiled through the shame and stepped out of the now hot and stuffy trailer, intent on getting as far away as possible.</p><p>She stormed across the lot, only barley able to acknowledge the people who acknowledged her.</p><p>Agatha <em>fucking</em> Harkness.</p><p>Once inside her little trailer for the day, with her favourite person again, she flopped immediately down onto the couch beside a stressed out looking Alice.</p><p>“You look great.”</p><p>“Good because I need my mugshot to be good.”</p><p>“Mugshot? What?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness just made me look like an ass in front of the whole makeup trailer.”</p><p>Alice took a second before she looked around at Rio and placed her phone down, “What happened?”</p><p>“I forgot the stylist’s name and she told me it was-…”</p><p>“Oh, c’mon, Rio. That’s the oldest trick in the book.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio insisted, groaning loudly and closing her eyes as she tried to think back to how Agatha had looked at her before. Was it triumph in her eyes? No. It was something else.</p><p>“I hate her.”</p><p>“You don’t. You admire her. You want to marry her. You-…”</p><p>“Her poor fucking husband,” Rio huffed out, going to rub at her eyes and then remembering she’d just had them done up.</p><p>“He’s apparently an ass,” Alice said, done with her friend’s dramatics as she turned back to her phone.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care about the home life of Agatha Harkness. Not when she had just humiliated herself in front of half the crew.</p><p>“At least you look pretty,” Alice eventually said again, glancing over at a still annoyed Rio.</p><p>“Thanks. Just took a couple hours and like four hands on me at all times and I look passable all of a sudden.”</p><p>“Don’t give me that shit, Rio. God the amount of women you go through you’d think your self-esteem would be-…”</p><p>But Rio had slipped the cushion from under her head and used it to smack solidly into Alice’s chest, “shut up.”</p><p>“Whore,” Alice quipped and then laughed as Rio rolled her eyes and threw herself properly into a seated position, stealing Alice’s phone away.</p><p>“You’re a bigger whore than me. Plus you use my name to get in girl’s pants.”</p><p>“You use <em>your</em> name,” Alice reminded, stealing her phone right back.</p><p>“Actually I use my face.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Alice huffed and motioned to the rack of clothes on the side, “your dress. The red glittery one.”</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“I don’t kid about work. Put it on.”</p><p>Rio scowled at her friend who was suspiciously avoiding eye contact and then stood to stride over and survey the dress a little more closely. “Isn’t it a bit-…?”</p><p>“You’re hot. Flash some boob, show some thigh.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and disappeared to put the dress on, taking the time to admire herself in the small bathroom mirror before she stepped back out again and Alice looked expectantly up at her.</p><p>“See? Am I right or am I right?”</p><p>Rio turned, annoyed that Alice looked so smug, and stood in front of the floor length mirror, gaging just how comfortable she felt in a dress like this when all the questions would inevitably be about ‘the actor’s process’, ‘changes to the industry post-Me Too’, and ‘what did you want to be when you grew up?’.</p><p>But she supposed a little boob wouldn’t hurt.</p><p>The dress was a ruby red with long sleeves and a daring slit both over her left thigh and down her chest and Rio moved left and right to see the shimmer it gave off sparkle in the light.</p><p>“That dress alone will get you laid for a month when this goes out.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shot her best friend a look in the mirror, adjusting the opening of her chest a little so just a slither more of skin was exposed.</p><p>She settled back down on the couch beside Alice, waiting until the last minute to put on her impossibly high shoes and they skimmed through the questions they’d received earlier in the week as prompts for what they might be speaking about today.</p><p>It was mostly the same stuff Rio had answered time and time again. Nothing extraordinary.</p><p>So by the time there was a knock at the door and one of the wardrobe assistants came in to check the progress of Rio’s outfit choice, she was comfortable enough to devote her time and attention to the woman, allowing her to adjust the dress, tweak her hair, and prod and poke her about until she was happy.</p><p>She even let her convince her to slide her heels on and had to hide the fact that her left ankle was a little tender from where she’d rolled it earlier.</p><p>But Alice saw. And she moved close to help support Rio subtly as she led her from the trailer and to where the shoot was to take place.</p><p>Rio’s stomach began to churn with the beginnings of nerves and even the whispered affirmations of Alice did nothing to ease them.</p><p>“You’ve got this. I’ll be right off-camera. Just be yourself… but not too much.”</p><p>From behind them came a sudden shout of Alice’s name and the light footsteps of a tall beautiful black woman, now beaming at the two of them, carrying an iced coffee in her hand.</p><p>“Alice! There you are. Where have you been hiding?”</p><p>Alice’s hand fell from Rio’s waist and Rio had to fight the urge to pull her back as she moved to kiss Jennifer Kale’s cheek.</p><p>“Oh, y’know, this one keeps me busy.”</p><p>Jennifer hummed and glanced at Rio, briefly checking her out in her sparkly dress.</p><p>“Vidal. Pleasure.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but notice her reception from Jennifer was significantly icier than Alice’s had been and she knew why.</p><p>Rio was one of the reasons her and Alice couldn’t spend as much time together as they’d like to at functions.</p><p>And, Rio thought a little guiltily, the reason Alice and Jennifer were more often than not on other sides of the country, or the world, sitting it out at boring movie shoots or press junkets with their respective clients.</p><p>Then again, Rio was also the reason Jen had met Alice in the first place.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t hired her best friend, she’d never have been at the swanky events where her and Jen could dress up and flirt for a few hours.</p><p>And that’s exactly what they did.</p><p>Alice and Jennifer had fallen into a strange sort of relationship for the past two years. It lived only at premieres or awards shows.</p><p>And the occasional phone call about some press matter or other.</p><p>But Rio had overheard a few of those calls and knew for a <em>fact</em> that ‘baby’ was not a word she’d be using on someone who was just a colleague.</p><p>And Rio, being loyal to Alice, and at least initially with no other true friends in the industry, had often found herself in Jennifer’s presence since the invitations to swanky events and exclusive premieres had started to open up.</p><p>In fact, she’d spent more time with Jennifer than she had her boss, <em>much</em> more time.</p><p>Agatha she only saw across the room, shining her light on more important people than Rio Vidal.</p><p>And Jennifer was free to schmooze because Agatha didn’t need the hand-holding.</p><p>Jennifer was charming and beautiful and the exact type of woman who would be working for the equally charming and beautiful Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Alice had once stated that Agatha and Jennifer were who they both wanted to be when they grew up. But Rio knew this wasn’t true - mostly because Alice was desperate to get into Jennifer’s pants and Rio wouldn’t mind being in Agatha’s either.</p><p>That had been, until she’d set her up in the makeup trailer.</p><p>
<em>Bitch.</em>
</p><p>“Jennifer,” Rio found herself saying, holding her hand out with a smile, “Come here often?”</p><p>Jennifer pursed her lips but Rio thought she might be trying to hide a smile as she took her hand and shook it gently, “You should probably go in. Agatha’s been there for at least ten minutes. Can’t be Hollywood’s ‘golden child’ and be late now.”</p><p>‘Golden Child’ had been Rio’s designated epithet for months now, since a mawkish article came out about her in the New York Times.</p><p>Alice loved it. “Good for the brand,” she’d say. Rio hated it.</p><p>But unable to fight the clock, she withdrew from the two and turned to make her way into the studio, sucking in a breath when she saw the little set before her.</p><p>It was smaller than she expected. Much more intimate.</p><p>On the sound stage sat a round table with seven chairs, all with glasses of iced water before them.</p><p>On one of the chairs sat the woman she knew to be the English actress, Sylvia. She looked regal and unamused in the warm glow of the studio lights, her gaze off in the middle distance somewhere.</p><p>Probably thinking about what fresh horrors she could spew, Rio thought.</p><p>But just off to the right of her were her friends, a gaggle of three gorgeous women all in varying shades of red.</p><p>Wanda, Jessica, Isla.</p><p>She strode over, making eyes and smiling at the crew members as she passed and trying her best to ignore the strain on her ankle as she did.</p><p>Wanda spotted Rio first and beamed at her, holding her arms out expectantly and laughing as Rio slipped into them for a hug.</p><p>Wanda was the kind of woman who got on with most people and Rio felt lucky that they’d met on a movie a while ago and had been fast friends with ever since. She was always a friendly face to run to at an otherwise boring or uninviting industry party.</p><p>Jessica similarly pulled Rio into a big hug and Isla smiled into her own with Rio too.</p><p>“Ready for this? Should be fun!”</p><p>Rio only hummed in response, her arm still loosely draped around Wanda’s waist as a means to both ground her nerves and take the weight off her ankle.</p><p>But her proper response was lost on her tongue as she looked over and saw Agatha speaking with the journalist who would be leading the interview.</p><p>Agatha was talking, though Rio couldn’t hear what she was saying. But she was making the journalist nervous if the shuffling of her cue cards were anything to go by.</p><p>Whatever they were talking about, whatever was making the journalist nervous, was completely lost on Rio for the sight of Agatha’s outfit.</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost popped out of her head.</p><p>Agatha was wearing an oversized red suit jacket and… and that was it.</p><p>Her long toned legs had a light tan on them that from where Rio was standing looked natural and the jacket ended perilously close to the apex of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Surely that must be illegal.</p><p>Her sleeves were rolled up casually to her elbows which made it look natural and as if Agatha had simply pushed them there herself. Her hair was draped over one shoulder and her eyes, her eyes…</p><p>Rio had been caught.</p><p>She looked away quickly, but not quickly enough for Agatha to have missed the way she’d been staring. The way she’d been <em>ogling</em> at her.</p><p>If Rio weren’t currently caked in make up she’d have been worried she were as red as the dress she were wearing.</p><p>But she kept her gaze down, purposefully avoiding looking back up, and choosing instead to zone in on young Isla who, despite her impressive pedigree for such a young actress, was talking of how nervous she was.</p><p>Rio felt Wanda move from her side to go to Isla instead but she hadn’t been expecting it so she stumbled a little and winced when she placed her foot properly down.</p><p>Wanda shot her an ‘are you okay?’ look that she brushed off with a smile and she settled herself back, leaning slightly to the right so she could take the strain off.</p><p>But there wasn’t time now for worrying about her ankle or that she wanted to kiss Agatha or or that she hated Agatha or that Agatha now thought she was a pervert.</p><p>She was being ushered to her seat, offered a tea, and left to do what quick maths were needed to determine who would be sitting next to her.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Opposite her was Wanda, looking serene and unbothered by the fussing attention of something touching up her blusher. Beside her was Isla, looking a little green with nerves and beside her was Sylvia, still as regal as ever. Then came Jessica, grinning and trying to reassure Isla with a wink.</p><p>And an empty seat.</p><p>Rio felt the tell-tale sign of a weight on the back of her chair as somebody slipped past and held it as they sat down, followed swiftly by the familiar perfume of Agatha Harkness as she took her seat beside her.</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge her presence. She didn’t even look around at her.</p><p>She simply stared straight ahead, watching as the journalist took her place and they were all of them introduced to her.</p><p>The concept was simple. An hour or so of chat and questions.</p><p>Each one of them would get their chance to shine, to answer questions on acting, and on their latest movie. Then other questions would be a free for all and they were all of them encouraged to jump in whenever they wanted.</p><p>Simple. Easy. Quick.</p><p>And as the lights moved down and the cameras moved in, Rio began to feel settled. Her mind went from busy to blank in seconds in the way it did when she had an audience or a camera to perform to.</p><p>She was being introduced for the camera and she managed to smile easily, as if it had taken her off guard and she were simply happy to be there.</p><p>“Welcome everybody. It’s a pleasure to have you all here. We’ll start off easy. Favourite movies? Just one. Anyone can jump in.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced around with a coy smile, seeing who would bite first, who would set the tone.</p><p>Sylvia: “<em>Ben Hur.</em>. Charlton Heston was, for me, everything.”</p><p>There were polite murmurings and Rio thought it were clear that neither she nor the other actresses had ever seen <em>Ben Hur</em>.</p><p>Wanda jumped in then: “<em>Mary Poppins</em>. It’s the nostalgia for me. I used to watch it all the time with my mom. Julie Andrews can do no wrong in my eyes.”</p><p>“Oh then I raise you <em>The Sound of Music</em>,” Jessica said with a grin. Her best role. The chemistry with Christopher Plummer is to die for.”</p><p>“Isla?”</p><p>“That’s a hard question. I love so many. Maybe <em>The Notebook</em> or something, I don’t know. It’s a good sick-day movie.”</p><p>Rio smiled at all of these answers and was still racking her brain for her own answer when the interviewer turned to Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha? Favourite movie?”</p><p>“<em>A Woman Under The Influence.</em> Powerful. Beautiful. Rowlands at her best.”</p><p>“All quite different answers,” the journalist said with a smile as she turned to Rio.</p><p>“And last but not least, Rio?”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and knew somewhere off camera Alice would be cursing her out. But she also knew it would fly back down and give her a purposefully dishevelled look even when she sat in all her finery.</p><p>“Honestly? Because of the sheer spectacle of it and how it made me feel as a kid: <em>Jurassic Park</em>. That or <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em>.”</p><p>“Alright!” The interviewer announced with a grin, “a good eclectic mix there, I think. Questions won’t get that much harder from here on out, I promise.”</p><p>The questions came slow and steady from then on, and people began to relax.</p><p>Occasionally, between questions, someone would call to cut and hair and makeup artists would run on to touch lipstick or eyeliner up and Rio noticed that everyone was particularly keen on fussing over Agatha.</p><p>She did her best not to look at her.</p><p>And when it was Rio’s turn to wax lyrical about her movie, about the film making process, about the joy of creating this character, she’d forgotten this was something she’d even been nervous about.</p><p>“Can you tell me a little about your choice as a queer actress to take on three queer roles in the past year? Was it intentional, did you seek it out? Or was it just something that happened and you jumped at it?”</p><p>“Oh, I mean, I have lived experience of it, right? I know what it is to be closeted like Angel in <em>Tampa</em>, I know what it’s like to kiss a woman you’ve had a crush on for ages or a woman you spot across a bar. So these roles…”</p><p>Beside her, Rio was aware of a slight shift, of movement in her periphery, of a hand that raised and landed on the back of her chair. Agatha had turned more to her.</p><p>“… they allow me to play more because I’m pretending a little less. So I guess I seek them out, but I also think it’s important to focus on more than just the sexuality of a character. I’m a lesbian and I have been in love and heart broken but so have straight women. And heartache feels the same, regardless of who you are or who you love.”</p><p>The journalist nodded and Wanda across from her smiled and said: “Well said.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and dared to glance to the side, clocking suddenly what she’d expected to see: that Agatha was still holding the back of her chair, her body angled her way.</p><p>Rio took a sip of water.</p><p>“Do you think only queer actors should play queer roles?”</p><p>A question that Rio had been plagued with for years now.</p><p>One that she never enjoyed answering because you could never please everyone.</p><p>“I don’t think queer actors <em>have to</em> always play queer roles but I do think that if we continue to cast and favour straight actors then it says a lot about who and what we value as an industry, and as a culture. But generally having more queer parts available I think is a win for everyone, particularly those actors who often don’t get the opportunities that straight actors might.”</p><p>Two questions about queer identity. Rio knew Alice would be furious.</p><p>She hated it when in mainstream interviews like this it was all anyone wanted to bring up.</p><p>But Rio didn’t mind.</p><p>It sometimes meant she was stopped in the street by a kid, or even an adult, struggling with their own sexuality and they’d seen her talking about it in a medium like this and it made them feel better.</p><p>So she always tried her hardest with those questions.</p><p>For the people who needed her to.</p><p>“And with this role in particular, in <em>All The Wrong Gods</em>, focusing a lot on seeking absolution for what your character considers to be her inherited badness, how did you work through that as an actress?”</p><p>“I’m Catholic. I carry guilt with me wherever I go. It wasn’t so hard.”</p><p>And then she heard it, a miraculous, tiny, snort from beside her, hidden amongst the laughter around the rest of the table.</p><p>Rio turned her head, and saw Agatha watching her, an amused smile on her face that Rio, if she didn’t know any better, would have guessed were genuine.</p><p>But she’d been wrong before.</p><p>She smiled back at her and turned back again only when the journalist probed some more, “So you think it’s easier to act when you feel close to your character in some way?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and laughed because god if she were anything like her character in this movie then she were in big trouble.</p><p>“Close can mean lots of things. If I can identify something in them that is familiar to me either through myself or people I know then, maybe.”</p><p>“I find it easier when I <em>don’t</em> know what I’m doing or who the character is,” Wanda interjected, shooting Rio a smile, “it feels scarier for sure but trying to make it up as you go along for me is the best way I’ve found to do it.”</p><p>Rio settled back in her seat slightly, glad the spotlight was off her for a few seconds, still more than aware that Agatha’s hand was still resting on her chair.</p><p>The conversation moved on and Rio jumped in where she could, but remained cognisant of Alice’s instruction to be herself, but not too much.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had moved away from her chair after maybe ten minutes, and in moving it away Rio felt herself able to breathe properly again, no longer half focused on the pale hand so close.</p><p>And when it came to Agatha’s turn to speak, Rio took advantage of the opportunity to look at her, to properly look, with no fear that she could be accused of being a pervert this time.</p><p>So long as she focused on her face.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” the interviewer had said, and Rio had watched as Agatha pursed her lips and straightened her back slightly. “Three time nominee, one time winner of the Academy Award for Best Actress.”</p><p>Jess whooped and Agatha released a laugh, that was as well-timed as it was self-deprecating.</p><p>It was like watching a master at work.</p><p>“You’re bringing us <em>No Heaven Like This</em>, and in it you play Agnes, a woman who has recently lost her son. Obviously, you have a child of your own, how easy or difficult was it to separate yourself from Agnes?”</p><p>“Impossible. Impossible.”</p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath and Rio watched as her hands fidgeted before her on the table.</p><p>“When you’re playing with grief, when you’re trying to live in it for the sake of the performance, of your character… it’s impossible to remove yourself from it.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s gaze fell to her hands and she noticed she was toying with her wedding ring, a plain band of gold.</p><p>“I’m a mother before I’m an actress. Everything I do, or have done in my life, is for him. So playing a character where she was just the same, where she was having to live this half-life because her son was taken from her because sometimes boys just die… I thought of my son every day and how lucky I am to have him.”</p><p>Beside her, Jess reached a hand to touch Agatha’s arm and Agatha shot her a quick smile before focusing back on the interviewer.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and watched as Agatha forced her hands to relax, splaying them along the tabletop.</p><p>She wanted to reach for one.</p><p>“Did you speak to anybody going through that type of grief in preparation?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shifted again and Rio watched her shrug her shoulders, lifting a hand to tuck her hair back behind her ear.</p><p>“It wasn’t my place to use anyone else’s grief.”</p><p>There was a pause where everyone processed and Agatha spoke again, “Really brought the mood down, sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this and caught Agatha’s gaze as she turned to look at her, and in it she noticed a softness she hadn’t seen before.</p><p>Maybe it was the lights, maybe it was Agatha talking about her son, but it was there, and it made Rio want to reach for her, but she didn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched up a little as if reading Rio’s thoughts but as soon as it happened it was gone, and Rio turned away to focus back in on the questions now sent out across the table.</p><p>The rest of the conversation went easily, with Rio able to make the whole table laugh a handful more times. And by the time it was over, Rio felt more relaxed than she had all day.</p><p>“Nicely done,” a voice beside her, closer than it had been before, said.</p><p>She glanced around just as Alice made it to her side and pressed her lips to her cheek, echoing Agatha’s words unknowingly into her ear as Rio’s gaze met Agatha’s and she watched her stand and walk from the table to find Jennifer.</p><p>Rio swallowed as her gaze dropped briefly to the backs of toned thighs and then turned to Alice to meet her in a hug as she rose to her feet.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice was saying as she pulled away, back in work mode. “Just the photoshoot, then home.”</p><p>Rio groaned internally but was soon hurried along to a waiting makeup artist who was ready to touch up her face and she was chastised for fidgeting a little as she watched Alice disappear off to flirt with Jennifer.</p><p>From her position by the table still, Rio watched as everyone else was poked and prodded by their own members of the crew and she wondered if it was only her who felt like a dress-up doll.</p><p>But her gaze was soon moving inevitably over to Agatha who was on her phone again, oblivious to the three people around her fluffing her hair and touching the makeup up on the tip of her nose.</p><p>She wondered how she felt, if she minded, if she luxuriated in it.</p><p>But her idle daydreams were interrupted when Agatha looked up, as if years of being stared at by strangers in public meant that she could pinpoint exactly who was looking at her.</p><p>They locked eyes.</p><p>And Rio saw, or thought she saw, Agatha’s gaze drop from her eyes, moving significantly further south, then further south still.</p><p>And then, was she looking at her ankle?</p><p>“Rio,” a voice made her startle and she turned around quickly to see a man in a headset smiling expectantly at her, “Your turn. We’re doing individual shots then the group.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and turned to follow him, knowing that in just seconds she wouldn’t be alone, and sure enough Alice was suddenly at her side, clutching her hand and swinging it lightly between them.</p><p>“I might be in there, you know.”</p><p>“In where? Jennifer’s-…?”</p><p>“<em>Don’t.</em>”</p><p>Rio laughed and dropped Alice’s hand when she was ushered into the centre of the small space designated for the photographer.</p><p>A younger PA ran over to Rio as she was positioned and posed by the friendly photographer and Rio noticed a crowd form close by, the red outfits of her fellow actresses standing out against the typical black and white uniforms of the crew members designed to blend in.</p><p>“We’ll be filming too. Don’t be shy about moving.”</p><p>“Music, Miss Vidal? Anything you want?”</p><p>“Something heavy. Loud.”</p><p>The small PA nodded and scurried off as Rio accepted the last minute adjustments to her lipstick and Alice appeared again in her eyeline, “Big smiles. Wide eyes.”</p><p>“You want me to look insane?”</p><p>“I want you to look beautiful but approachable.”</p><p>“I think if you try for approachable you often end up manic.”</p><p>“Fine. Do whatever you want.”</p><p>Rio grinned and forced a grin out of her best friend too, but quickly softened her smile when she realised she was making the poor makeup artist’s life a bit harder.</p><p>“I’ll smile and think of being on the couch later, okay?”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Rio scoffed lightly as Alice spun on her heel and Rio watched her head back to Jennifer who was now just behind one of the large lights, stood directly by Agatha.</p><p>Rio chose to ignore the fact that Agatha Harkness of all people had come to watch the show and instead she concentrated on the photographer, where she wanted her, what poses and angles she’d like, and she did as she was told, shifting positions and trying to make her movements as fluid as possible.</p><p>It was over before Rio had even thought it had really begun and she was ushered off the set to be replaced by Isla who still looked nervous.</p><p>Wanda grabbed Rio just as she was making a beeline for Alice.</p><p>“Hey, I’m starved. Want to grab something from crafty with me?”</p><p>Rio was a little taken aback by this request but nodded all the same and shot Alice a look before she followed Wanda to the little table to the side full of food.</p><p>“Forget how to walk in heels? What’s going on with your foot?”</p><p>So that’s why Wanda wanted her alone.</p><p>Rio grimaced.</p><p>“God, is it that obvious?”</p><p>Rio glanced down at her ankle and couldn’t see that it looked any different to her other but she could feel the strain, and it was getting worse the more she stood.</p><p>“Well you fell earlier when I moved away and I overheard,” she reached for a cannoli the size of her hand, “Harkness was asking Alice about it.”</p><p>Rio paused, her one hand now hovering over the danishes. “Agatha was asking? Asking Alice? My Alice?”</p><p>“Mm,” Wanda shrugged, completely unaware of Rio’s internal struggle now she was tucking into her pistachio cannoli. “Yeah. Asked if you’d fallen.”</p><p>Rio blinked stupidly, looking down at the plate of food just beneath her fingertips and then forgetting it completely as she turned to look back over at where Alice stood with Jen and Agatha, now too far away for them to be able to hear any conversation.</p><p>“That’s…” Rio mumbled, almost to herself, but Wanda was leaning behind her and grabbing more food for herself.</p><p>“Aren’t you eating? Don’t let me eat it all alone.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and forced herself to focus in on the plethora of food available to her but now she wasn’t so hungry.</p><p>“Yeah. Sorry. I haven’t eaten all day.”</p><p>Had she been stumbling about the place and she’d not noticed? Had she grimaced every time she took a step?</p><p>But Wanda was holding up a piece of cheese to her mouth and she had no choice but to take it, grateful that she’d been forced to but still feeling less than hungry.</p><p>A soft clearing of a throat nearby made Rio turn with Wanda’s hand still hovering in the air by her lips, now holding a half-bitten piece of cheese and Rio began to choke on the piece she’d bitten off.</p><p>Agatha had clearly watched the interaction, and Rio was mortified to have been caught being fed by another actress, even if the other actress in question was just Wanda.</p><p>Surely it had looked innocent enough. Surely it hadn’t looked like Rio were flirting or being less than professional on a set.</p><p>But Wanda’s hand came down hard on her upper back and Rio spluttered a little more as she caught her breath again and swallowed down the piece of cheddar that had betrayed her so.</p><p>“Dodgy ankle <em>and</em> choking in one day? Bad things come in threes,” Wanda warned with a soft smile as she rubbed Rio’s back gently.</p><p>“Great. Thanks. Great.”</p><p>Releasing a laugh, Wanda returned her attention to her cannoli, green eyes darting to Agatha who was now the other side of Rio and picking up an apple.</p><p>Rio grabbed a bottle of water from the back of the table and cleared her throat roughly, “I should go back to Alice.”</p><p>“Careful on the ankle there, doll. Need some help?”</p><p>Rio froze momentarily, and even Wanda beside her looked a little surprised, but she managed to keep her cool and didn’t turn to the woman who’d offered her help, barely even acknowledging it as she shook her head once, shot Wanda a small smile, and then as gracefully as she could she strode back over to Alice.</p><p>Rio could feel eyes on her as she walked away and she assumed it was both Agatha <em>and</em> Wanda, but she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>Either way, she was embarrassed enough that she didn’t want to see either of them again.</p><p>But Alice was busy flirting with Jen and so Rio had to make do with hanging by the crew, and soon enough settling in the back with a worried Isla and an easy breezy Jess to discuss how everything had gone.</p><p>By the time they were all called to the group shots, Rio had managed to speak to Alice about requesting she would be able to sit and so she sat first as everyone moved around her, being practically manhandled into position.</p><p>Soon enough, Rio had a nervous photographer’s assistant adjust the hem of her dress just so on her thighs she became aware of a presence beside her that was beginning to feel oddly familiar but no more welcome.</p><p>Agatha had been positioned by her left side, standing so Rio’s head were at her chest level and Rio felt suddenly like a sweaty teenager beside the head cheerleader in some random flush of fortune in French class.</p><p>Before she knew what was happening, her arm had been taken and draped around Agatha’s waist, and Rio felt dizzy when Agatha moved, without anyone instructing her to, closer to her.</p><p>She felt her hand rest gently on her upper back and Rio flexed her fingers subconsciously in the dip between Agatha’s waist and her hip.</p><p>It was too intimate, too close to be to anyone who up until that day Rio hadn’t exchanged more than five words with in eight years.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t protested and no one had made a fuss, so Rio remained still, though her body burned her from the inside out.</p><p>“You should ice it,” Agatha said quietly after one or two photos were snapped and then people ran in to adjust the actresses all grouped together.</p><p>“It’ll swell.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for a second but, given there were now at least five people with hair and makeup brushes around them, she slowly turned to look up at Agatha, shifting back a little and causing Agatha’s hand to move against her upper back.</p><p>“How did you-…?”</p><p>“You’re not that good an actress.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly, watching as Agatha Harkness turned slowly to look down at her, her expression was impassive, almost bored, until Rio caught her jaw flexing slightly and she turned away again.</p><p>“Observant,” Rio muttered quietly, but Agatha obviously heard it because she shifted on the spot and Rio turned back around to watch the camera being setup again.</p><p>Someone came by her and moved her hand on Agatha’s waist, making her fingers curl more around it so they’d be visible in the shot.</p><p>She felt the warmth of Agatha’s body against her own and the scent of her perfume and was reminded of what had happened earlier.</p><p>“You set me up.”</p><p>“Pardon me?”</p><p>“In hair and makeup. You set me up with Grace’s name.”</p><p>There was silence for a few seconds and Rio tilted her head a little as someone came to dab some glitter across her exposed sternum.</p><p>Agatha had clearly been waiting until they were more alone again.</p><p>“A harmless prank.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but didn’t say anything else, though she’d made up her mind that Agatha was just a bitch.</p><p>A ridiculously hot one.</p><p>“Smile everyone! Have fun with it!”</p><p>She schooled her face and focused in, moving her face only slightly with each shot taken to make sure they got all the optimal angles.</p><p>“She calls me ‘Aggie’,” Rio heard from above her, and she turned to look back at Agatha with a frown.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Grace. I’ve worked with her a few times and every time she calls me ‘Aggie’. I hate it. So… I saw the opportunity and I took it. Hollywood’s ‘golden child’ forgetting her name in front of everyone. She won’t forget that soon.”</p><p>It was as cruel as it was genius.</p><p>But Rio still wasn’t thrilled to have been a pawn in this game.</p><p>“Can’t you just ask her to not call you ‘Aggie’?”</p><p>“I have. Hasn’t sunk in. Might do now, though. People don’t like to be called by the wrong name.”</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Agatha turned as the flashes were still going off and dazzled down at Rio.</p><p>It was as mesmerising as it was earth-shattering.</p><p>And Rio forgot how to breathe.</p><p>She turned away and felt the flush across her whole body.</p><p>She <em>hated</em> Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But another break. Another pause for Jess to have her dress adjusted and Sylvia to remove a necklace that was apparently bothering her.</p><p>Rio turned to see Wanda and Isla chatting and she smiled at the sight of the younger actress clearly more relaxed.</p><p>Maybe it was that she had her fellow actresses so close that they felt like a group, maybe it was that the photographer had been shouting compliments at them all as she shot them, maybe it was that Wanda had a gentle voice and a softer smile, either way, Rio was pleased.</p><p>“She’s pretty,” a voice said somewhere above her and Rio stiffened again, once more made aware of who she was holding.</p><p>She turned from Wanda and Isla and looked around at Agatha, arching a brow slightly at the implication, “You think?”</p><p>“You know she is.”</p><p>Rio released a laugh and had to pull back, unable to think straight when this close to acting royalty, when this close to Agatha.</p><p>“I do,” she said as if it were obvious, because why was Agatha telling her this.</p><p>Her hand was now somewhere in the region of the middle of Agatha’s lower back, but hovering so her fingers were just lightly grazing the fabric instead of pressing close.</p><p>Agatha only nodded, her blue eyes somehow steelier than before, looking from Rio’s confused and slightly bewildered face to Wanda and back again.</p><p>But Rio’s hand was once again taken and she had no time to process this reaction.</p><p>Her hand was placed back around Agatha and she had to shift in to get close again, feeling Agatha’s fingers flex at the top of her upper back.</p><p>A strange feeling had settled in Rio’s stomach as she dutifully smiled for the camera.</p><p>It felt like she’d been caught doing something wrong when in actual fact she’d done nothing wrong at all.</p><p>But soon they were being descended upon again and Rio was asked to slide down to the lower step of the small set of blocks laid out for them.</p><p>She adjusted herself before anyone else could so she was at least decent for a room of people with all eyes on her and the other actresses.</p><p>As she shifted her hips to tug her dress down a little more over her thighs she felt her arm being lifted and placed down on something warm and solid and she looked around to see a shaking assistant adjusting her arm over Agatha Harkness’s lap.</p><p>It looked like a surrealist painting.</p><p>In that Agatha was art and touching her didn’t feel real.</p><p>Rio’s arms were covered in the sparkly red material of her dress and her arm was being moved centimetre by centimetre up and down Agatha’s thigh as if each movement would make or break the photo.</p><p>The assistant looked distressed and uncomfortable and Rio leant up to place her free hand on her wrist to reassure her, “This is fine. We’ll make it work, thank you.”</p><p>Rio received a grateful smile in return for her kindness and the assistant moved over to the next person to begin moving them around.</p><p>Clearly she’d been just as flustered by touching Agatha as Rio felt.</p><p>Rio watched for a second before she turned her head up to look at Agatha with a slightly amused grin, fighting her instincts to look down at the expanse of skin before her for fear she’d faint where she sat.</p><p>“This okay?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to say something else but decided not to, choosing instead to turn back around and face front, adjusting her arm on Agatha’s lap so it was touching as little of her skin as possible.</p><p>But her hand was taken suddenly and Rio assumed it was by the assistant again.</p><p>She turned and saw that it was instead Agatha who had taken it, who had slipped her fingers between Rio’s and placed her hand on Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“This okay?” Agatha parroted back to her and Rio thought she’d heard a hesitance in her tone, but she was so distracted by the sight of her hand in Agatha’s that she couldn’t be sure.</p><p>“Fine,” she managed to utter, turning quickly before she could lose her   mind entirely and pull her hand away.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s other hand sit on her shoulder and Rio wondered what in the fresh hell had happened that this was how she’d end her day, hand in hand with Agatha Harkness for all the world to see.</p><p>Because this wasn’t just happening now.</p><p>This would happen over and over again for months to come.</p><p>When new people picked up <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> magazine.</p><p>Or people watched the video.</p><p>Or Rio thought about how Agatha’s hand felt above her own.</p><p>Because Agatha’s hand was warm and and soft where it curled around Rio, her palm pressed down against the back of Rio’s hand, her fingers  slipped between Rio’s, filling the spaces Rio had never until now considered to be lacking something.</p><p>Just empty gaps waiting for Agatha to fill.</p><p>But then Rio suddenly worried that her hand was too warm and soon enough she’d be sweating over an Oscar-winner.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t pull away, didn’t move a single muscle where she was touching Rio and so Rio didn’t move either.</p><p>She’d lost to Agatha already today, she wouldn’t lose again.</p><p>Only once did her hold on Agatha drop, when the photographer herself came over to adjust Rio’s dress and Rio moved her hold from Agatha’s hand.</p><p>That strange feeling of her hand feeling suddenly less than surfaced and she stretched her fingers out subconsciously, trying to return to her previous equilibrium.</p><p>But when Rio was as perfect as could be, Agatha squeezed her shoulder and Rio glanced around to see her hand waiting just above her knee, expectant that she’d return to their previous hold.</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a second before she lay her palm down on Agatha’s knee and splayed her fingers so Agatha could hold her there again, and this time, with her hand now feeling strangely whole again, Rio felt a jolt somewhere in the pit of her stomach as Agatha’s thumb brushed over her own.</p><p>The shoot didn’t last much longer, which was a mercy as far as Rio was concerned; she wasn’t sure she could take much more of the infuriating woman she’d had a crush on for almost a decade.</p><p>But when it did end, Rio thought she was going mad for the girls around her beginning to move, to switch positions, to relax their posture and adjust themselves, and only Agatha stayed still.</p><p>Her left hand fell from Rio’s shoulder but her right stayed on Rio’s right, and even as Rio shifted to respond to a question from Wanda, and she heard Agatha above her talking to Sylvia, Agatha hadn’t removed her hand.</p><p>Wanda was asking about drinks with everyone after the shoot but Rio felt like she was floating above them somewhere, watching as Agatha Harkness quite literally held her hand.</p><p>But, no. She had to be realistic and not dissolve into a fantasy.</p><p>If she moved it she could steal her hand back. It wasn’t as if Agatha were gripping her. In fact, it was more like resting. She was <em>resting</em> her hand over Rio’s, it was innocent, uncomplicated, thoughtless.</p><p>And so Rio turned more and shifted her hand, twisting it slightly from under Agatha’s grip and for just a second Agatha responded, she’d held on, and then released.</p><p>Rio had her hand back, and regretted immediately having pulled away in the first place.</p><p>Just as she was agreeing to Wanda’s suggestion of drinks, she glanced round at Agatha and saw that the actress once again looked impassive, looked neutral, and wasn’t looking at her.</p><p>And so Rio shook it off. She shook it off like the memory of Agatha one hazy night in a grim Chicago bar.</p><p>She turned back to Wanda and smiled, this time without having to pretend, “Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Preparations for Cannes were in full swing and Rio had never felt less prepared in her life.</p><p>Thank god for Alice.</p><p>Thank god for her loyal, guard dog of a best friend.</p><p>They’d somehow hit the big time where everyone wanted Rio, everyone wanted to dress Rio, to bedeck her in jewels, to paint her face in the best makeup, to style her hair with products and using techniques neither of them had ever even heard of.</p><p>And while Rio was prodded and poked and measured and draped in all this finery, Alice was on hand to make sure it wasn’t too much.</p><p>That the Versace gowns weren’t making Rio feel uncomfortable.</p><p>That the brilliant diamonds offered to her weren’t giving her anxiety about how much they cost or the various ways Rio could lose or break them.</p><p>That the people rouging her cheeks were the kind of people you’d want nearby for hours every day, the kind of people who’d touch your makeup up without making a fuss.</p><p>Because, really, Rio’s success was Alice’s success.</p><p>She wouldn’t be here without her.</p><p>It had been Alice who’d jumped in one night after one of their improv shows where a seedy looking guy had approached Rio offering to manage her.</p><p>It had sparked the idea in Alice’s head that the way to crack this showbiz world was to get serious.</p><p>So she’d pretended to be Rio’s manager until she no longer had to pretend.</p><p>Until Rio picked up the first proper gig she auditioned for and started to earn just enough that she could support the two of them in a one bed studio apartment in a less than desirable area of downtown LA.</p><p>But it was something. And it was home to them both for over a year.</p><p>Then more jobs came, and more money with them, and soon they were in a bigger apartment where they had their own rooms.</p><p>Then Alice was able to move out into her own apartment.</p><p>Then Rio helped her buy it and bought one for herself.</p><p>And so on until they were both lying across the large couch in the middle of Rio’s new house, both scrolling through their phones, one working, the other swiping through a dating app.</p><p>“You better stop that, you know.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You’re a serious actress now. Serious actresses don’t have sex.”</p><p>Rio laughed: “Well this serious actress does. Or at least is trying to.”</p><p>She turned her phone around and leant up suddenly, grinning at Alice, “She’s cute, right? A surgeon! Mom would be so proud.”</p><p>“Your <em>mom</em> would only be proud if you <em>married</em> a surgeon. Are you looking to marry this woman?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and flopped back down again, scrolling through the pretty brunette surgeon’s Raya profile, “Maybe. Not immediately, obviously. But if we got on and-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said with just a hit of exhaustion in her voice, “maybe after you win your Oscar you can think about settling down.”</p><p>Rio paused her scrolling and looked to the ceiling for a second before she sat back up again, “are you saying that as my best friend or as the woman I pay to manage my career?”</p><p>“Both?”</p><p>“Both?” Rio asked in confusion, frowning down where Alice rested her head back against the arm of the couch. “Didn’t you once say that being single worked in my favour because-…”</p><p>“Because it meant you didn’t have any problems travelling and working away, yeah. But… I think it would help your brand if… y’know you settled a bit. And also… you’re not cut out for being alone.”</p><p>Rio blinked, stupefied by the sudden damning indictment of her career and personality.</p><p>“I can be alone,” she said lamely, frowning a little now where she sat. She reached for Alice’s wrist and forced her to put her phone down.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said with a gentle sigh, mirroring Rio’s position now as she sat up and stretched her legs to the side of Rio’s hips.</p><p>“That first week you moved in here, how many girls did you have over?”</p><p>“I-…” Rio bit down on her lip and watched Alice for a second before she relented, “Seven.”</p><p>“One every night so you wouldn’t be alone.”</p><p>“That’s not-… I was just ovulating or something. I was horny.”</p><p>Alice smiled a little and reached to take Rio’s hand, “Hey, it’s not a <em>bad</em> thing. It’s actually very sweet if you ignore the fact that you’re a bit of a-…”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Rio said quickly, though she’d relaxed just a little and smiled as she squeezed Alice’s hand. “I can be alone.”</p><p>“I know it’s hard to find someone when you’re away all the time but-…”</p><p>“It’s impossible, Alice. You know that. Seems all glamorous at first and then people realise what a drag it is.”</p><p>Alice nodded in understanding and looked down at their hands still entwined together, “I know. But it’ll happen one day. You’ll find some absolute knockout who doesn’t mind you being away for weeks at a time.”</p><p>“Do I want to be with someone who doesn’t mind me being away from them?”</p><p>“I think it would be impossible to find someone who wouldn’t prefer a little distance from you.”</p><p>Back to teasing, Rio thought with a small smile, and she squeezed Alice’s hand with a playful wriggle of it, “Charming, thank you. Hope you’re putting those vibes out to the press: ‘Rio Vidal: good for a while but gets annoying.”</p><p>“It’s actually the subhead of the <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece.”</p><p>Rio hummed in amusement and released Alice’s hand to drop back down again, “After Cannes I won’t have any time for girls anyway. So might as well make the most of the time I <em>do</em> have now.”</p><p>“Fine. Get it out of your system because you cannot be seen to be picking up women in the middle of a film festival.”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Rio said absently, throwing away Alice’s chastisement with a wave of her hand, “I don’t speak french anyway.”</p><p>Alice scoffed and nudged Rio’s hip with her foot and Rio smiled as she continued to swipe through the options available to her in her little app, pushing back the worry that maybe Alice was right, maybe what she did need was someone to come home to at night, someone to be there.</p><p>But Awards Season waits for no woman and that night on the couch with Alice was the last night of freedom until they flew out to Cannes the following week.</p><p>A team had been assembled to sort even Rio’s outfit for the plane ride over and Rio felt more than a little embarrassed that she was being instructed exactly what to wear for a long haul flight.</p><p>Usually she’d wear a comfortable pair of leggings and a sweater.</p><p>This time around she was in a soft cashmere t-shirt and tan slacks that admittedly were very comfortable.</p><p>She’d insisted she didn’t want any makeup though, and Alice had helped her case on this one, preferring not to be sat next to a complaining Rio if she were made to wear makeup all the way to France.</p><p>She looked effortless and chic, which was the whole point of the hours long meeting she’d had with her new stylist on her festival looks.</p><p>She looked like a movie star.</p><p>And she was greeted like one when they finally landed on the concourse at Cannes Mandelieu.</p><p>Alice had warned her there may be more press than she was used to and so it wasn’t a huge surprise when she was practically blinded by the lights of a thousand cameras as she stepped through the airport arrivals and out into the heat of the day.</p><p>Alice hurried her through, constantly close and as protective as always as she helped Rio get to their waiting car.</p><p>They slipped inside and Rio felt suddenly like she could breathe again as the door slammed shut and they had at least a barrier between them and the dozens of men with cameras trying to capture Rio Vidal’s first entrance to a film festival.</p><p>“Intense,” Rio breathed out, hiding wide eyes behind large sunglasses.</p><p>“You did good,” Alice reassured with a smile, checking their baggage had been placed in the trunk securely before she turned to the driver and told him to go.</p><p>“You too,” Rio said with a smile, squeezing Alice’s thigh briefly in acknowledgement that this was also Alice’s first time at an overseas film festival.</p><p>They grinned at each other and Rio found it easy to relax.</p><p>This was the stuff she hated but could manage.</p><p>This was the stuff that people said she was good at.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t exactly prepared for the circus that was to follow.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she muttered as they pulled up to the Carlton Cannes.</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said urgently, turning to her best friend with hidden wide eyes beneath her sunglasses.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“I know. It’s okay. They won’t be allowed in. Wait there. I’ll come round and get you and we rush you in.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, feeling a strange mixture of disbelief, horror, and like she were being pranked.</p><p>The paps liked to get her when she was out on a run, a couple times they’d caught her out for dinner with a friend, with Alice, even with her parents, but she’d never had to deal with a hoard of them.</p><p>But the rowdiness of the paparazzi crowd with nothing until Rio Vidal stepped from her carriage of choice and entered into the swarm.</p><p>They were hungry sharks and she was the chum.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“Rio! Over here, sweetheart!”</p><p>“Bienvenue a Cannes, Rio!”</p><p>Rio kept her head down, angled to where she could just about spot her feet through the sudden flashes and movement, and Alice crowded her to the left whilst a footman from the hotel rushed to her aide at the right, creating space for her to be able to slip through the crowd and reach the peace of the opulent lobby.</p><p>She breathed out and thanked the doorman with a soft word in French and then squeezed her friend’s arm as she walked with her to the reception desk.</p><p>It felt a little like being royalty for the day, or like she’d won a competition.</p><p>Everyone was thrilled to see her, everyone was happy for her to be there in their hotel, in their little town.</p><p>Of course, being a movie star came with its advantages.</p><p>The pretty receptionist smiled at Rio and greeted her in French before slipping into accented English.</p><p>“Bienvenue, Mademoiselle Vidal. I trust you had a good flight?”</p><p>“It was great, thank you. Your hotel is beautiful.”</p><p>“I’d be happy to give you a tour once you’re settled in, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat quietly and whispered, “Basta.” <em>Stop</em>.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t respond because the blonde and blue eyed receptionist was now checking over her details and Rio who wouldn’t have even considered properly flirting with the pretty young woman now just wanted to do it to annoy Alice.</p><p>But her train of thought was interrupted as Alice placed her passport on the side and a loud American voice rang through the lobby.</p><p>“Alice, be still my beating heart.”</p><p>Rio, who had been in the process of fishing out her own passport, turned to see Jennifer Kale, standing a few feet away with her arms open wide and a brilliant smile across her perfect features.</p><p>“Jen,” Alice said a little more demurely, with no less enthusiasm.</p><p>She stepped away from Rio and went over to exchange two kisses with Jennifer, one on each cheek.</p><p><em>French already,</em> Rio thought with a smirk.</p><p>But her attention was back on the receptionist who was now taking the passports to check over details.</p><p>A holiday romance was exactly what Alice deserved and Rio now regretted their choice to share a suite together. Alice had said it would be easier for prepping to be in close proximity and not have to worry about running across the hall all the time.</p><p>Plus, the fact that the Movie Studio were funding this trip meant that Rio could demand practically what she wanted but Alice would be left with the dregs.</p><p>So Rio had demanded a two bedroom suite.</p><p>It was the least she could do.</p><p>And so, once the details were confirmed, and Rio had received more than a handful more smiles from the receptionist, she was directed towards the elevator where a snappily dressed concierge was waiting.</p><p>“Your bags are waiting for you in your suite, Mademoiselle.”</p><p>“Rio, s’il vous plait,” Rio purred with a grin, deciding a little flirt wouldn’t hurt to start the day off right. “Merci, Camille.”</p><p>The receptionist ducked her head a little and Rio knew if she pushed it she could maybe get a number, maybe ask her for that tour later, but she felt a hand on her arm and turned to see Alice smiling at her.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio shot the woman behind the counter one last movie star grin before she turned away, pocketing their passports and the room keys as she did.</p><p>“Jen wants to go grab a coffee before the madness starts later. I could really use the caffeine hit. Would you mind?”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and glanced over at Jen who was watching them closely.</p><p>Rio shot her a small smile which was returned but then Jen’s eyes dropped to her watch and Rio looked back to Alice. The woman wasn’t subtle.</p><p>“Sure. No problem. I’ll take a shower and see you later?”</p><p>“Great,” Alice said with a relieved grin, as if she’d ever thought Rio would demand she stay.</p><p>She squeezed Rio’s arm in goodbye and then moved back over to Jen and motioned for them to leave together.</p><p>Rio watched this for a second and felt a slight pang of jealousy that had nothing to do with Jennifer and everything to do with the fact that she was left alone to check out their joined suite in the fanciest hotel in the fanciest of places.</p><p>But she picked herself back up quickly when she approached the concierge and found herself once again greeted like the movie star she was.</p><p>“Bonjour, mademoiselle. I am here to take you to your suite.”</p><p>“Merci,” she said with a smile, turning then as the elevator dinged lightly. Even the bells here sounded angelic.</p><p>She and the concierge stepped aside a little when it was clear the elevator was already occupied and Rio’s stomach did a flip when she saw by whom.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was stepping out in a matching white linen suit and large Chanel sunglasses on top her mane of wild hair.</p><p>But it wasn’t just Agatha.</p><p>The man Rio knew to be her husband was with her. Recognisable from the photos she’d seen of him on magazine covers, from the internet, and from across the room at industry parties.</p><p>He was tall, dark, and handsome, everything you’d expect in the man married to one of the most famous actresses in the world.</p><p>And Rio hated that they looked good together.</p><p>But they did.</p><p>Ralph Bohner inclined his head slightly at her and Rio smiled back, but her attention was once again on Agatha who’d stepped back slightly from her husband who - Rio noted - had stepped from the elevator first.</p><p>
<em>Prick.</em>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Was Agatha’s smile genuine? Was she as pleased to see her as she looked?</p><p>Rio had to remain objective, though suddenly she feared the thirteen hour flight had made her look less than brilliant compared to Agatha’s current, glamorous state.</p><p>She cursed herself for refusing to wear makeup.</p><p>But she had one thing in her back pocket that could claw back some power for her, something that now felt like an inside joke, some tiny semblance of a common ground between them.</p><p>And now, feeling a little on the back foot being caught all alone in the presence of Agatha and her asshole of a financier husband, she used it.</p><p>“Aggie Harkness,” she beamed, watching as Agatha’s eyes widened slightly and then narrowed, a slow smirk creeping up her features as she took Rio in.</p><p>They stood like two cowboys in a vintage western, sizing each other up, seeing who would draw first, though Rio had flashed her piece already.</p><p>“Agatha,” the husband was saying, as Rio’s own charge - the concierge - waited patiently for whatever Rio wanted to do.</p><p>Rio glanced at him and saw that he looked less than impressed with whatever his wife was doing talking to another actress when he wanted a croissant on the waterfront.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t even flinched and as Rio glanced back at her she saw she was still being assessed, and her brow quirked a little, amused that she’d won a point so soon in their first interaction since the Roundtable shoot.</p><p>“You’re cute,” Agatha concluded, after what to Rio felt like minutes of a standoff that can’t have been longer than ten seconds. “Call me that again and you’ll regret it.”</p><p>“Threats before midday? Très chic.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes again but Rio caught her lips twitching at the sides and she fought the urge to kiss Agatha there, wondering if she could get away with a French two cheek kiss, accidentally brushing the lips of the most famous woman in Cannes right now.</p><p>“Au revoir, honey,” Agatha purred, giving Rio no chance to act out her fantasy and before she could even blink again, Agatha had turned from her and was sauntering through the lobby with her husband.</p><p>Rio released a soft breath and stepped into the elevator, wondering if she were imagining the lingering soft scent of Agatha’s perfume in it.</p><p>The concierge pressed the button and just as the doors began to close Rio looked up and saw Agatha turning back to her from across the lobby.</p><p>They made eye contact and Rio suddenly wished she’d tried something because maybe, just maybe, Agatha wouldn’t have protested.</p><p>But then the doors closed and Agatha was lost to her.</p><p>The length of the elevator ride to the top floor of the hotel was all the time it took for Rio to rid herself of her silly schoolgirl fantasy. Agatha had no more romantic interest in her than she did in the concierge standing beside her.</p><p>Although, she supposed, he was at least a man, so maybe in the battle for Agatha’s heart he had a total advantage.</p><p>But as the elevator pulled to a gentle stop on her floor, she was led out to a large and beautiful lobby and to the third door on the right.</p><p>The Katara Suite.</p><p>“Welcome to your new home for the week, mademoiselle Vidal.”</p><p>Rio stepped inside as the concierge opened the door for her and tried to school her face into what would be an appropriate reaction for a sophisticated movie stair.</p><p>The suite was more beautiful than even the pictures on line had led her to believe and she wished Alice were here to take it in with her.</p><p>The concierge took her on a tour of the space, showing her the grand shared living area with large curved couches and a view of the water beyond. He took her to both bedrooms and pointed out the bathrooms attached to each and the features therein.</p><p>And lastly, he took her to the balcony and presented the full view of the waterfront, proudly evidencing his hotel’s greatest asset.</p><p>When he’d had assurance enough from Rio that she would be fine and didn’t need anything else, she sent him on his way with a large tip and a bright smile and finally, finally she were alone to run around the suite again, taking in everything she’d missed upon first viewing.</p><p>With Alice gone, she had the luxury of picking the best room and soon found herself situated on the balcony after a long shower with a seltzer and fresh lime courtesy of the free bar just off the main living space.</p><p>Rio Vidal was on top of the world.</p><p>Her gaze drifted across the sea of deepest blue before her and as she watched the sun dazzle the waves with its shine she felt a deep calm washing over her.</p><p>She’d built this. Her and Alice. They’d worked their asses off to get here and now here they were.</p><p>But as Rio’s gaze drifted along the balcony she couldn’t help but notice that it wasn’t the two of them.</p><p>It was just her.</p><p>And she felt a sudden, unexpected melancholy as she looked at the seat beside her, free of another person there to enjoy this with.</p><p>It clutched at her heart in a way she couldn’t shake even as she finished her drink and heard the telltale signs of her best friend arriving into their little piece of paradise high above the streets of Cannes.</p><p>“Holy shit!”</p><p>Rio laughed as she appeared at the door to the balcony, grinning at Alice, shaking off the surprising loneliness for the sake of her best friend, “None of that language, please. We’re <em>sophisticated</em> now.”</p><p>“I mean though,” Alice said with her eyes wide and her mouth open, her sunglasses perched atop her head, “<em>holy</em> shit.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio agreed as she marched across to take Alice’s hand and drag her to the balcony to show off the view like a proud mother introducing her baby to the world. “You’ve said that.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Alice continued to be gobsmacked for at least another ten minutes as Rio trailed behind her on her many rounds of sightseeing around the huge suite.</p><p>And Alice didn’t even complain that Rio had taken the largest room because, <em>holy shit</em>, her room was huge too.</p><p>Once Rio’s patience for her friend’s shock had died down entirely she changed the subject from “how much do you think these cushions cost?” to “how did it go with Jen?”.</p><p>Alice’s expression changed on a dime.</p><p>She went from bemused to shy in the flash of an eye.</p><p>“Good. We just had a coffee and… yeah. Good.”</p><p>“Good? Just good? No make out sessions by the water? No leg touching under the table? No-…”</p><p>“Stop it. We’re taking it slow. I’m not even sure she likes me.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Who wouldn’t?”</p><p>Alice shrugged slyly and then buried her face in her hands for just a second before she removed them again and stood assertively, “Okay. We have about ten minutes before everyone arrives. You need to look incredible for the opening party.”</p><p>“Are you saying I <em>don’t</em> already?” Rio asked as she looked down at herself in her ‘Delaware Diva’ t-shirt Alice had bought her one Christmas years ago and the denim shorts she’d owned since she was about seventeen.</p><p>Who said a sophisticated actress couldn’t wear her most comfortable clothes in her most fancy suite?</p><p>“Actually, I want you to change. You can’t get ready in that. It wouldn’t look good on socials.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “Surely it makes me look down to earth. Normal.”</p><p>“You are not down to earth and normal, you are premiering your movie at Cannes.”</p><p>“I’m not changing, Alice. Three outfits in one day is more than enough.”</p><p>Alice sighed but knew Rio well enough to know not to argue. “Fine. Appeal to the masses. Charm them with your normalcy.”</p><p>Rio laughed and threw a cushion in Alice’s direction. She caught it with ease and looked down at it with a sudden frown as she tested the weight in her hands. “I’m gonna guess about $250.”</p><p>“Wrong,” Rio said with a grin as she stood to go and place her phone on charge in the other room, speaking over her shoulder as she left, “I looked it up earlier. $400.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Not ten minutes later, as Alice had predicted, the suite was abuzz with noise and movement.</p><p>SZA was blasting from a speaker someone had brought with them and Rio was being prodded, poked, pulled, and pressed into the glamorous starlet she needed to be.</p><p>Alice was somewhere nearby, out of Rio’s eyeline as she diligently reviewed the plans for the day.</p><p>And Rio, Rio was being plied with champagne though Alice had insisted no more than two glasses before they left, Rio’s new hairdresser, a fun new friend called Miguel, had on more than one occasion topped Rio’s glass up when Alice wasn’t looking.</p><p>Rio’s buzz meant that she was relaxed as she let the artists work their magic on her.</p><p>It was just a red carpet, sure it would be one of the busiest she was yet to walk, one of the most important, perhaps the <em>most</em> important of her career to date, but she could handle it.</p><p>What was a quick walk amongst thousands of screaming members of the press?</p><p>It took close to three hours for each member of the glam squad to be fully satisfied with their transformation of Rio Vidal.</p><p>And in that time they’d turned her from attractive to bombshell.</p><p>Her nails, hair, face, lips, and even body had transformed.</p><p>Alice had wolf-whistled more times than she could count and taken more photos than Rio thought necessary, but she didn’t mind. She lived for this sort of thing. The compliments weren’t unwelcome.</p><p>By the time she was dressed and had the most uncomfortable shoes she’d ever worn slipped onto her feet, she felt ready. Four glasses of champagne more than likely helping with this.</p><p>Rio had been dressed for the first night at Cannes by Louis Vuitton, a last minute switch from her preferred option of Versace.</p><p>But she didn’t mind when the dress looked and felt this good on her.</p><p>It had a longer train that she was used to but moved easily in the heat of the evening.</p><p>It was a deep burgundy, covered in sparkling diamantés that glittered every which way she turned. It had a plunging neckline and an equal plunge at the back, with see-through strips of fabric along the planes of her tanned back up to her shoulders.</p><p>It was a movie star dress.</p><p>She’d arrived.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said after a few moments taken to get a few more snaps of Rio for her instagram before they ventured into the madness. “Remember, red carpet, stairs, top of stairs, home straight, okay? Then party. We’re scheduled with the rest of the cast so you’ll have friendly faces.”</p><p>“Yep,” Rio said absently, toying with the bangle hanging around her wrist that must have been worth more than three months’ rent of her first apartment. “Easy.”</p><p>“Breezy, beautiful,” Alice concluded with a warm smile as she squeezed Rio’s fiddling hand. “You got this.”</p><p>When they entered the lobby together Rio was suddenly reminded of the power of celebrity.</p><p>Everyone was staring.</p><p>Women smiled and men ogled.</p><p>Even as she passed by the familiar face of an actress she didn’t know well but had seen at events like this before, and certainly on the big screen, she smiled but was rushed past by a work-mode Alice who was determined to not be late for their big Cannes debut.</p><p>The same group of paps that had been outside before had somehow quadrupled in size and it took a little longer to get through them even as two of the hotel staff and one of the execs from came to help.</p><p>Rio’s heart was racing so fast she felt like she’d been thrown from a plane without a parachute as she was cautiously delivered into the waiting car.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Alice uttered for the millionth time that day as she slammed the door behind them and they were left in a tinted goldfish bowl of relative peace.</p><p>“You can say that again.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio turned to catch Alice’s eye and found herself beaming at her best friend, both thunderstruck by the world they’d managed to find themselves in.</p><p>They remained silent for the rest of the short journey to the entrance to the red carpet, each of them lost to their own disbelief that this was their life now.</p><p>But if Rio had thought outside the hotel was insane, then it was nothing to the red carpet.</p><p>“Focus on faces, remember,” Alice was saying to her in her best therapy speak, “faces, Rio. They’re just people.”</p><p>Rio acknowledged this only with a quick nod before she clambered out of the car, helped by a man in a tux and a headset who had the unenviable job of helping the women out of the cars as they formed a queue to the entrance.</p><p>She placed a smile on her face and only relaxed even slightly when Alice’s hand hit the small of her back and she guided her lightly in the direction of the other waiting cast and crew members.</p><p>It felt better to be with the others now.</p><p>She wasn’t facing the sea of screaming press alone.</p><p>But Rio was the star of the movie and the studio’s best shot at awards so she was ushered to the front, made to walk the carpet first.</p><p>She took it in her stride, pretending to feel as confident and elegant as she looked.</p><p>She could barely see for the flashes of cameras and heard nothing but her name being shouted from every way she turned. But she posed, and she smiled, she winked and she waved.</p><p>She nailed it.</p><p>By the time she hit the bottom of the large staircase at the top of the carpet, her director was there to greet her, taking each of her hands in his and kissing them in a display for the cameras as well as a means to greet Rio without ruining her makeup.</p><p>“Terrified?” He asked with an indulgent smile.</p><p>“Me? Never.”</p><p>He laughed and turned with her to pose some more until he helped her walk up the stairs where they waited for the others to join them.</p><p>One of the youngest cast members was there and ran to Rio before any of the others, and Rio embraced her fully, pleased of the normal reaction in an otherwise abnormal place.</p><p>Once she’d straightened back up she opened her arms to pose in a line with the others, grinning for all of Cannes to see as she surveyed the fruits of her labours.</p><p>Nowhere did she see Alice, but she knew she’d be close, keeping a watchful eye on her.</p><p>But the photo call was soon over and the little troupe was ushered away to escape the circus and head in to the night’s main event.</p><p>Once inside, before Rio could so much as take a glass of champagne that was offered to her, she found herself surrounded by well-wishers in the form of faces familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p>Even now, it sometimes took her by surprise that people knew her name, let alone wanted to speak with her.</p><p>She was just some kid from Delaware who had dreams of making it big.</p><p>But hands were on her back, touching her arm, taking her hand and lips were brushing her cheeks every which way she turned.</p><p>It took ten minutes until a touch she recognised found her again and Rio turned to Alice with a grin, raising her brows, “So?”</p><p>“Perfect. You looked incredible.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, thinking Alice was being a little hyperbolic but she’d take it for now.</p><p>“Jeunet’s over there,” Alice murmured in a softer tone, stepping a little closer to Rio so she wouldn’t be overheard, “time to schmooze it up with the directors. Come on.”</p><p>Alice took Rio’s hand and Rio obediently followed, slipping easily through the crowds that parted for her and her determined best friend.</p><p>But Alice’s name was suddenly called and it surprised both the aim of the call and Rio, who stopped dead in their tracks and looked around.</p><p>Jen.</p><p>Rio smiled at the sight of Jennifer Kale, leaning back against the large mahogany bar, holding out two glasses of champagne to them both.</p><p>And for the first time that night, Rio wasn’t the one being looked at.</p><p>Jen had eyes only for Alice and Rio knew then that Alice was an idiot to think that Jennifer Kale didn’t have feelings for her.</p><p>No one could mistake that look.</p><p>Alice immediately forgot their mission to schmooze a world-renowned director and turned to pull Rio to Jennifer instead, which made Rio laugh, though Alice missed it through the din of the party.</p><p>“Hi,” she breathed out when they got close enough, self-consciously releasing Rio’s hand as she moved to take one of the glasses offered to her.</p><p>“Looking good, Wu,” Jen said with an appreciative look up and down over Alice’s outfit for the night: a sleek white dress that was simple, understated, and elegant.</p><p>“You look incredible,” Alice offered right back and Rio suddenly felt like a spare part to their little flirt.</p><p>She cleared her throat and glanced over her shoulder to see if she could make a break for it with anyone else she knew.</p><p>“Agatha said she saw you in the lobby earlier, Vidal,” Jen said suddenly and Rio turned to her with raised brows.</p><p>Agatha. In the whirlwind of the past few hours she’d forgotten all about her.</p><p>Her stomach flipped and she ignored it, instead taking the glass of champagne and taking a quick sip. Bubbles helped to calm nerves. It must be scientific or something.</p><p>“She did?”</p><p>Cool enough, disinterested enough. She was an actress for a reason.</p><p>“Mm. You’re on her floor too. She’s just next door.”</p><p>This was news to Rio. News she was very glad she hadn’t been aware of until now.</p><p>“Where is she?” Alice asked curiously, glancing around the throng of people.</p><p>“Oh, she’s been trapped by a couple studio heads. Ralph’s not helping much.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and was about to fish for more detail on how exactly Mr Agatha Harkness wouldn’t be helping when she felt a touch to her elbow and she turned to see Carol Danvers grinning at her.</p><p>“Hey, you. I have someone I want to introduce you to.”</p><p>Before Rio could even say hi back, she’d leant around her and was addressing Alice with a smile, “Mind if I steal her Alice? You’ll be pleased with me, promise.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes playfully but nodded and Rio knew if Jen weren’t there she’d have insisted on coming with but as it was, she had other priorities.</p><p>Plus, of all Rio’s friends in the industry, Carol was probably the safest bet to be left alone with.</p><p>Straight-laced and well respected, it had taken Rio several bottles of beer and much pleading to get Carol to allow her one cigarette one night on her terrace back in LA. So Alice was more than content to let Rio go play with her for a little while as she flirted some more with Jen.</p><p>Carol only smiled and grabbed Rio’s hand, leading her through the crowds until they arrived at their destination and Rio suddenly wanted to die.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha,” Carol said, reaching to touch the pale skin of a toned arm resting along the side of a black dress.</p><p>Rio could see a sharp little cape visible just beneath the long wavy brunette hair that lay across it down her back. The neckline looked to be high and the fit straight down, with a train a little smaller than Rio’s pooling behind her.</p><p>As Agatha turned, Rio in took a sharp breath, now able to see the look in full.</p><p>The cut was indeed high to her neck, a shallow curve giving just a glimpse of toned traps until the fabric appeared again at her shoulders, creating a little sleeve that connected to the cape Rio had seen from behind.</p><p>The effect was intoxicating.</p><p>The dress hugged Agatha’s body perfectly without showing much of it off at all apart from her arms. And Rio found it hard not to stare at them.</p><p>But Agatha was looking at her now, giving her a once over, once, twice, three times.</p><p>Rio felt hot all of a sudden, embarrassed that it might look like she’d <em>asked</em> Carol to do this.</p><p>“Agatha, have you met my friend Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio wanted to die.</p><p>She saw Agatha’s lips twitch in amusement and saw she was about to answer when a man’s voice entered the fray: “Rio,” he said triumphantly, “that’s it. We saw you in the hotel today. I knew you looked familiar.”</p><p>Rio tore her gaze from Agatha’s and looked up to the man now offering his hand to her. She took it and shook firmly.</p><p>“I’m Ralph, Agatha’s husband.”</p><p>“Pleasure,” Rio said, though the pleasure she’d stated didn’t quite meet her gaze as she stared up into the eyes of the man that was lucky enough to be married to the goddess still standing before her.</p><p>“So you have met?” Carol asked with a smile, “Good. That makes this easier then. Agatha, Rio’s a huge fan.”</p><p>
<em>Oh god.</em>
</p><p>“The night you won the Oscar, we’d only just met, Rio hosted this tiny dinner party and we all sat on the floor crowded around the tiny screen watching the show.”</p><p>“You did, did you?”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye again and watched pools of blue sparkle like the sea she’d been looking out over just a few hours ago.</p><p>But then Ralph had moved to snake an arm around his wife and their eye contact dropped as Rio watched this happen with an unwelcome feeling of jealousy flare up in her chest.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t even reacted to it, she was still watching Rio.</p><p>“Anyway, all that to say, I think you guys would be amazing on screen together. You’ve sway, Agatha, anything you think little Rio here could jump in with you on?”</p><p>Rio’s previous state of jealousy faded so suddenly it was like it hadn’t happened.</p><p>She was so mortified that Agatha might think she’d asked Carol to help her get into a movie with her that she couldn’t breathe with it, though she was aware she’d only said one word since arriving to this little corner of the party.</p><p>“Rio Vidal in a movie with me?” Agatha asked with a growing smirk, her gaze still on Rio though Rio was now doing everything in her power not to meet it.</p><p>“Nothing springs to mind but I can keep an eye out. But asking for a friend and not for yourself, Danvers? Didn’t enjoy working with me before?”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, wondering if Agatha were throwing her a bone by moving the focus of the conversation to Carol rather than herself. But she still didn’t dare look at her again as Carol answered with an ease of manner that suggested she actually had enjoyed working with Agatha and even liked her.</p><p>But Rio’s attention was now on Ralph.</p><p>She watched as he swigged his champagne, his hand still resting on Agatha’s hip, his eyes on the crowd, and at a lower vantage point than would suggest he were looking at people’s faces.</p><p>Rio fought off a shiver, not believing for a second that anyone married to Agatha Harkness would even bother checking out anyone else. Was this guy blind?</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>The sound of her name shook her back down to the conversation and she was surprised to see that it was Agatha addressing her.</p><p>Their eyes met and Rio felt her heart rate pick up again, performing a one track percussion solo against her ribcage.</p><p>“How are you enjoying Cannes?”</p><p>It was such a simple question, as if she and Agatha were just shooting the breeze like any old friends might. But Agatha was one of the most powerful people in the room, at this festival, in Hollywood, and Rio couldn’t take her eyes off her.</p><p>“I mean… I’ve mostly seen my room and the red carpet, but so far so good.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio thought she saw her gaze drop a few inches briefly before she took a sip of her champagne.</p><p>She had to get a grip.</p><p>“It’s the only festival I ever come to,” Ralph said suddenly, taking advantage of his position by Agatha to join in the conversation when as far as Rio was concerned he absolutely was not welcome.</p><p>“Best wine, best food, best beaches.”</p><p>Carol smiled warmly at him, the only one of the little group who was apparently willing to indulge this kind of conversation and Rio took the opportunity to excuse herself, squeezing her friend’s arm in farewell before she turned to leave.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said quickly, stepping away from her husband as he began to regale Carol with stories of Cannes passed.</p><p>Rio felt a warm hand curl around her wrist and turned in surprise to Agatha, “Don’t go far. I want to introduce you to Lilia.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly and turned her body back to Agatha, the two of them now a foot or so away from Carol and Ralph.</p><p>Agatha’s hand remained curled around her wrist.</p><p>“Lilia? Who-…?”</p><p>But it clicked suddenly, Lilia Calderu, two generations above Agatha, an acting legend who still demanded a huge pay check as well as the respect of the whole industry.</p><p>“Really?” Rio finished feebly, a little in shock that Agatha would even offer this.</p><p>“I was talking to her about you last week.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing and if Agatha hadn’t been right in front of her, her soft hand still curled around her wrist, she might have thought she was teasing her.</p><p>But the look in her eyes told her otherwise.</p><p>“I… okay,” Rio said quietly, a light furrow appearing in her brow, wondering why Agatha Harkness was talking to industry heavy weights about her.</p><p>They looked at each other for a second longer and then Agatha slowly released her wrist, her eyes darting down again briefly before they moved back up, “You look good.”</p><p>And Rio opened her mouth to respond, to tell Agatha that she looked better than anyone else in the room, than anyone else on the planet, but her name was called from somewhere behind her and Agatha glanced over, “it’s your director. Best go.”</p><p>She knew she was being dismissed, but she couldn’t feel the sting of it because Agatha Harkness thought she looked good, was still looking at her, was still close.</p><p>Suddenly she was 24 again, alone with Agatha in a toilet stall, with no thoughts in her head except how lucky she was that Agatha were looking at her like that.</p><p>But the memory faded as Agatha turned from her and Rio had no choice but to make her way over to her director, feeling the sickly feeling of someone who couldn’t quite get a hold on their emotions at a time where she had to be anything but emotional.</p><p>She didn’t see Agatha for a while after their first interaction and didn’t even see Alice for a little while either.</p><p>The party was so huge and the space so crowded that it was impossible to find anyone easily.</p><p>Rio stuck with her cast and crew for a little while, feeling the affect of champagne slowly work its way into her system, even if she were making sure to top it off with water and canapés.</p><p>It was when she was speaking to a nervous Spanish director in a quiet corner that she found Alice again. Or, Alice found her.</p><p>She came over with a bright smile and introduced herself to the director, surprising him by speaking Spanish with almost as much fluency as Rio had been.</p><p>Once they’d extricated themselves and Alice had exchanged her card with the director, Rio got a rundown of her performance for the night from Alice.</p><p>“I’ve had four directors, at least a dozen producers, two studio heads, and countless actors all bother me about you. I haven’t spoken to anyone who hasn’t mentioned you. Everyone’s charmed, everyone’s impressed. You’ve got a career yet, kid.”</p><p>Rio laughed at the theatrics as Alice put on her best Cary Grant voice and tugged her over to an area with seats, desperate to get off her feet for the first time in almost three hours.</p><p>“Enough about all that. Where’s Jen? How’s Jen?”</p><p>Alice only grinned in response to this and was about to answer when she spotted someone behind Rio’s shoulder and stood quickly, making Rio jump a little at the urgency of it.</p><p>“Ms Calderu,” she said reverently and a jolt of panic shot through Rio because if Lilia were here then…</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha’s voice sounded suddenly, “this is Alice, Rio’s manager.”</p><p>Rio stood slowly straightening herself out quickly before she turned to Lilia, watching as Alice rushed around and held her hand out to her, “Pleasure, Ms Calderu.”</p><p>“Please,” the older woman said with a friendly wave of her hand, but shook Alice’s all the same, “Lilia’s fine.”</p><p>“And,” Agatha continued, holding a hand out to Rio as if to show her off, “this is Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio smiled slightly as Lilia took her all in, looking her over slowly and smiling as she did.</p><p>“The talk of the town.”</p><p>“Lilia,” Rio breathed out, stepping around her now abandoned chair to hold her own hand out to Lilia, feeling Agatha’s eyes on her every movement.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Lilia said with an enigmatic smile, “I’ve had Harkness here in my ear all night about you.”</p><p>“A little exaggeration there,” Agatha said quickly, moving around to sit down in the seat Rio had just vacated.</p><p>“Not by much,” Lilia countered, still maintaining eye contact with Rio. It felt a lot like Lilia were looking for something in her brown eyes, but Rio couldn’t be sure what it was.</p><p>There was talk, obviously. Hollywood was a town of talkers, gossipers. Lilia had a reputation for being a little kooky and Rio had seen her work, seen her interviews, knew she could be a little intense, but this… this was something else.</p><p>“I see a lot of light in you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and heard a movement behind her that suggested Agatha had turned in her seat to watch the two of them but she couldn’t take her eyes away from Lilia who simply stared at her.</p><p>“I… Thank you?”</p><p>Lilia just hummed and from the corner of her eye Rio saw Alice step a little closer, her fingers just grazing the side of Rio’s forearm where it rested by her side. But Lilia wasn’t a threat, wasn’t making Rio uncomfortable, more… exposed.</p><p>But nothing felt more exposing than Lilia turning the hand she still held onto over, supporting Rio’s wrist as she traced her fingers over the lines of her palm.</p><p>“God,” Agatha said from somewhere behind them, “Jesus, Lilia. We’re at a party, not a seance.”</p><p>“I’m curious,” Lilia said quietly, though Rio was sure it was so quiet that Agatha wouldn’t have heard it.</p><p>Lilia’s touch was soft and for the first time she’d dropped her gaze from Rio to look down at her palm, tracing the lines slowly. Alice had moved even closer and was leaning over to see if she could see what Lilia was looking at but to both her and Rio it looked like a whole lot of nothing.</p><p>After what felt like a lifetime and a lot of huffing from Agatha behind them, Lilia gently curled Rio’s fingers over and covered her hand with her own.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>“I… what’s interesting?”</p><p>“Do you see an Oscar in there?” Alice asked in all seriousness and earned a quick slap to her arm from Rio.</p><p>But Lilia was just smiling and moving around to take Alice’s seat, leaving the two original occupiers of the chairs to have to stand up.</p><p>Rio shifted a little where she stood, transferring her weight to one foot to ease help the discomfort.</p><p>“So,” Lilia said suddenly, a little more spritely now she was seated and had apparently read whatever she’d read in Rio’s palm. “I haven’t had one conversation tonight where your name hasn’t come up in some capacity. You’re quite the hit.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and had to fight back her grin, completely flummoxed by this woman she’d been watching since childhood now sitting before her.</p><p>Sure, she’d caught glimpses of her at awards shows and parties before, but she’d never been this close, never deigned to talk to the great Lilia Calderu.</p><p>She felt a different kind of intimidation with her compared to Agatha. Maybe because she hadn’t once had Lilia pressing her into the door of a bathroom stall, maybe because Lilia didn’t make her pulse quicken and her legs feel like jelly.</p><p>“It’s been a whirlwind,” Rio answered in the best media-trained response she could come up with.</p><p>Lilia only smiled and Agatha was the one to respond, “Jen’s furious about it. Thinks you have an industry plant paying people to keep your name being said. Keeps you fresh on people’s minds.”</p><p>“Oh? Does she think I’m raking in twenty mill a picture or something?”</p><p>Agatha smirked up at Rio and moved her arms to rest on the arms of the little chair she’d stolen, turning it into a throne beneath her.</p><p>“No, but I am.”</p><p>God, Rio wanted to kiss that damn smug look right off of her twenty-million-a-picture-face.</p><p>“Alice,” Lilia interjected suddenly, causing Alice to jump where Rio was still staring at Agatha, refusing to look away until she did.</p><p>“My manager is here, Helen. Allow me to introduce you?”</p><p>Rio broke the stare then, surprised by what she was hearing. She didn’t even have a second to regret it though because she was so intent on looking at Alice who looked just as shocked as she felt.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, yeah. Of course. That would be-… yeah.”</p><p>Lilia smiled and stood slowly from her seat, offering her bent arm to a shell-shocked Alice who sent Rio a small, unbelieving smile before she let Lilia walk her away to find her manager.</p><p>Rio watched them go and then immediately went to sit down, just desperate to get off her feet for a second.</p><p>The second she did she looked up and regretted it immediately because she had Agatha directly in her line of vision and saw her watch her curiously. Rio shifted slightly, self-consciously rearranging her dress so she wasn’t accidentally exposing herself to the room and the woman opposite.</p><p>“That went well,” Agatha said with a smile.</p><p>“The palm thing,” Rio said slowly, looking to check Lilia wasn’t in earshot, “what was that?”</p><p>“Oh, she likes to check before she works with people.”</p><p>“Check what?”</p><p>“I think it’s mostly to freak people out, test their nerve. You held up well.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, unsure if Agatha were praising her or making fun of her, or maybe both.</p><p>She decided to turn the conversation around, wanting to claw some power back because she had nowhere to look other than at the woman before her and the heady mix of champagne and compliments all night was making her want to jump her.</p><p>So the only topic that could possibly dampen her desire was what she brought to the table: “Ralph seems to be enjoying himself.”</p><p>This tangent seemed to take Agatha by surprise and her eyebrows shot halfway up her forehead as her fingers thrummed the arms of her chair, she surveyed Rio for a second before she suddenly dropped her gaze and Rio registered that this was the first time all evening that Agatha had been the one to properly look away from her first.</p><p>“He enjoys the glitz.”</p><p>“And you don’t?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and slowly brought her gaze back around to Rio, her blue eyes dropping briefly to dance across her diamanté-covered dress, “I like the sparkle.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, sure that if had been anyone else she might have picked up the thread of the flirt and let it unravel between them but it was Agatha, so she forced herself to ignore it.</p><p>But then she’d been silent for too long.</p><p>So long that Agatha’s gaze had flickered up again to meet her own and Agatha across from her raised her brows.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She turned away and cleared her throat, wondering why her body was betraying her like this.</p><p>Her fingers curled around the arms of the chair she’d sat in to take the weight off her aching feet that had now become the perfect viewing platform to stare at the one person she absolutely, positively could not have.</p><p>“Sorry,” she uttered after another few beats of silence, her pulse beating so erratically that surely Agatha could see her cheeks flushing beneath the expertly applied makeup.</p><p>“Long night. Lots of champagne.”</p><p>She didn’t look back around at Agatha but knew her eyes were still on her.</p><p>How could she not know?</p><p>“You’re opening the ceremony tomorrow?” Rio asked in an attempt to try and move the conversation back into safer territory.</p><p>“I am. Will you be there?”</p><p>“We couldn’t get tickets.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha’s brows shot up and she looked pensive for a second before she asked: “Would you like tickets?”</p><p>Rio blinked, wondering if Agatha were trying to trap her in some way.</p><p>But she decided she wasn’t and so she was honest.</p><p>“To see the most talked about movie in years?”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little, and Rio thought it was the most beautiful she’d ever looked.</p><p>“You flatter me.”</p><p>“Aren’t you used to that?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened and Rio felt her own grow to match it. God, this woman was devastating.</p><p>“Not from you.”</p><p>“My apologies, Ms Harkness. Must have left my manners at the roundtable.”</p><p>Agatha released a soft laugh and raised her hand to run through her hair and Rio couldn’t help it when her eyes flashed down to the curve of her bicep and she felt a jolt of desire sit low in her stomach.</p><p>“I’m not sure you were being particularly polite then either.”</p><p>“Oh? Did I offend you somehow? Not fawn enough over you?”</p><p>“Certainly didn’t tell me what a big fan you were.”</p><p>Rio laughed at this and stuck her tongue into the inside of her cheek, watching Agatha’s eyes dart to it before she spoke again, “And yet you’ve never told me you were a fan of my work.”</p><p>“No accounting for taste,” Agatha said with a smirk as their little bubble was burst and they’d been discovered by the who’s who of the Cannes festival again.</p><p>They watched each other even as they were descended upon.</p><p>Rio felt warmed under Agatha’s gaze but it wasn’t the usual flush of an unrequited crush.</p><p>Her whole body felt aflame, her insides crackling with the intensity of Agatha’s eyes on her.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” the man above her stole her attention and she was helped to her feet by him, smiling gratefully as she stood before him.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha’s attention being taken by an actor that Rio had heard bad things but she didn’t have the chance to look at her more as her attention was stolen by the man before her already asking whether she was enjoying the festival.</p><p>Somewhere in the next few minutes Rio lost Agatha to the crowds that had moved to swallow them both up.</p><p>She didn’t see her for the rest of the night.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Alice had found her again.</p><p>“You’re not going home with Jen?”</p><p>“Shh! God. No discretion,” Alice accused with a huff as she took Rio’s arm, “How drunk are you? We should leave whilst on a high. Leave them wanting more.”</p><p>Rio laughed and realised she was quite drunk because a few people turned around to look at her after she’d barked it out.</p><p>“Maybe that’s a good idea.”</p><p>Alice steered Rio out of the party with a firm hand on her lower back and that same determination to get Rio as quickly and cleanly as possible.</p><p>In the end, it took another thirty minutes to get Rio out and into a waiting car.</p><p>“I hate that you’re famous sometimes,” Alice huffed as she slammed the door shut behind them and Rio only rolled her eyes and laughed.</p><p>“Isn’t that your <em>whole</em> job?”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and rolled her head around to stare out the window, wondering if she’d been charming enough to the hoards of people who’d approached her that night.</p><p>By the time they’d arrived back in their suite, Rio was feeling significantly happier about her performance of the evening.</p><p>Alice had been telling her how many business cards she’d received, regaling her of the projects people had been hinting at getting Rio on board with.</p><p>It felt like a soothing bedtime story that her parents may have told her when she was little.</p><p>Only this story didn’t have princesses and dragons it had movies and famous directors.</p><p>Rio may have been gently lulled to sleep by Alice but she was also harshly woken by her not four hours later.</p><p>She groaned and rolled over in the king-sized bed, trying to hide away from the light of the day and the ferocious way Alice was pummelling her to get her up.</p><p>“I’m not fucking kidding, Rio! Get up! We need to get you ready. Now.”</p><p>Rio huffed and slapped Alice’s hands away where they continued to hit and grab at her.</p><p>“Stop! Stop! I have a free morning. You said. You <em>promised</em>.”</p><p>“Yes but that was until we got tickets!”</p><p>“Tickets?”</p><p>Rio huffed as Alice managed to rip the blankets from her with a triumphant grin.</p><p>“Jen just called. We’re going to see <em>No Heaven Like This</em>. Agatha got us tickets.”</p>

<em>"Jen just called. We're going to see No Heaven Like This. Agatha got us tickets."</em>
</p><p>“She did what?”</p><p>Rio’s head was spinning suddenly and it could only be for one of three reasons:</p><p>The amount of champagne she’d had last night<br/>
The fact that Alice had just heaved her into a seated position<br/>
The idea that after what Rio remembered to be a throwaway comment, Agatha Harkness had gone out of her way to secure Rio (and apparently Alice) entry to the hottest premiere in town</p><p>Perhaps it was all three.</p><p>“She got us tickets, you idiot. Get up! Get up!”</p><p>Alice was already hurrying to grab Rio’s phone, taking it upon herself to use Rio’s WhatsApp as a means to encourage the glam squad to be over sooner rather than later.</p><p>“We have an hour.”</p><p>“An <em>hour</em>?!” Rio yelled out in horror; the idea of showing up to Agatha’s premiere looking less than perfect suddenly lightly a fire beneath her ass as she threw herself from the bed.</p><p>“I <em>told</em> you to get up.”</p><p>The next hour was one of the fastest hours of Rio’s life.</p><p>She had four people working on her at once.</p><p>At least eight hands on her at all times.</p><p>Usually in moments like this Alice would comment on how this would be Rio’s dream date situation but there wasn’t even time for jokes.</p><p>Rio was deathly hungover and had time only for small sips of coffee in between lipstick application or the rouging of her cheeks to make her look less than the grey that she felt.</p><p>She’d long since decided that her hangover was partially alcohol-driven and partially a certain queasiness that had set in at the idea of Agatha personally inviting her to the premiere.</p><p>When she’d hardly asked.</p><p>When she barely knew her.</p><p>When she’d spent all night trying not to stare at toned arms or fall into intoxicating pools of blue.</p><p>Alice had been in her ear all morning about the benefits of being friendly with everybody’s favourite actress.</p><p>She’d been waxing poetic about Agatha’s power in the industry and how Rio would be smart to keep close, to keep her on side.</p><p>But Rio was at a loss for how to do that when apparently she was already on side - if the invites were anything to go by.</p><p>But then, in the back of her mind she knew, Agatha was the competition.</p><p>Not three days ago <em>Variety</em> had released an article about the early Oscar contenders and there, front and centre in the four-page spread, were photos of her and Agatha at different red carpet events. Both smiling, both the ones to watch in the Oscar race.</p><p>Maybe it was psychological warfare.</p><p>Maybe Agatha was trying to psych Rio out.</p><p>After all, <em>No Heaven Like This</em> was supposedly a masterpiece.</p><p>So making Rio watch it in a room full of the most influential people in the industry, watch Agatha receive what was sure to be a ten-minute-plus standing ovation for it, that was cruelty rather than kindness.</p><p>But despite Rio knowing that Agatha was an incredible actress she couldn’t bring herself to believe that the way she’d looked at her last night had been anything but kind, or interested, or in the very least, polite.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>The makeup artist huffed in a way that Rio didn’t think she would if she were currently plastering lipstick on Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Stop fidgeting.”</p><p>Rio grimaced in embarrassment and apologised quickly as she tried to focus back in on the task at hand.</p><p>Look good.</p><p>Look good for Agatha.</p><p>She mentally chastised herself as her hair stylist combed through her dark flop of hair, and could no longer look herself in the eye in the mirror.</p><p>Perhaps having a crush on someone so unattainable wasn’t the best option for a wannabe movie star.</p><p>Or maybe another actress would be fine.</p><p>But Rio felt things deeply, too deeply.</p><p>And Agatha was starting to take up too much of the brain space she needed to use to focus in, to nail every appearance, to charm the world.</p><p>She didn’t have time to try to charm a married mother of one.</p><p>Or to think.</p><p>As soon as she was deemed acceptable, she was wrestled into a little white dress and heels, and thrown a bag with her phone and then marched with Alice to the waiting car outside.</p><p>Rio didn’t even have time to register the pretty receptionist shooting her a megawatt smile on her way out.</p><p>“The press conference afterwards. You need to pay attention to how Agatha handles it,” Alice was saying in the back of the car with Rio.</p><p>“Press conference? We surely can’t-…”</p><p>“Well maybe you can’t but I can.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and smirked a little at her determined friend.</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“She’ll help, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>“You’re the competition.”</p><p>“So? You’re the competition too and Agatha got you in.”</p><p>But Rio turned away, unwilling to express her fears that that might not have been a kindness.</p><p>“Rio? She’s a better friend than you could find anywhere else. Don’t fuck it up, okay? We’re on the cusp of greatness and Agatha <em>is</em> great.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, tried to focus on what had happened last night.</p><p>How had she broached the topic of Agatha’s premiere? Had she asked for a ticket?</p><p>Everything still felt a little hazy by the time they were pulling up to the red carpet outside the theatre.</p><p>With some final words of encouragement, Rio was able to put on her best smile and saunter in.</p><p>The place was overrun.</p><p>They were some of the last in and the usher was reluctant to show them to their seats.</p><p>“Listen, kid. I’m telling you that these seats were reassigned to us.”</p><p>Rio had been trapped by a well-meaning journalist who she’d spoken to several times over the years but she could still hear Alice’s voice through the noise of the crowd.</p><p>As the journalist asked her how she was enjoying the festival she felt her stomach drop and fear clutch at her heart.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t got them seats at all.</p><p>“I’m <em>telling</em> you. It’s-…”</p><p>“What’s happening here?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped around when she heard Jen join the mix and she missed the journalist’s high praise of her latest <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece.</p><p>Jen wouldn’t prank Alice.</p><p>Agatha would prank Rio. But Jen wouldn’t prank Alice.</p><p>So she turned back and tried to drown out the urgent conversation of the two women beside her in favour of the man who’d once felt so sorry for her after arriving at a press junket and seeing her tired and miserable that instead of asking questions about the movie he asked her about basketball.</p><p>She’d give this man an exclusive on anything just for that.</p><p>“Vidal,” came Jen’s voice through the noise, cutting Rio off where she was telling the journalist about her plans for the next few days - what she could remember from Alice’s oft-repeated itinerary anyway.</p><p>“Quick. It’ll start soon.”</p><p>Rio excused herself politely and turned to Jennifer and a smug looking Alice.</p><p>“Don’t get used to this special treatment. She must have still been drunk when she called me this morning. It was a huge headache to get you both in here. I must have pissed off a hell of a lot of people. But she insisted. So.”</p><p>Jen looked furious.</p><p>Rio wondered how Alice was holding up about it.</p><p>But she didn’t have time to ponder the very intricate dynamics of their strange situationship because the lights were dimming and that meant the cast and crew would soon be arriving.</p><p>“Straight down, the two seats in the middle,” Jen pointed out, and Rio followed Alice down the row until they found the two remaining seats in the theatre that weren’t the exclusive front row.</p><p>Usually in a movie theatre Rio would opt for a back row seat where she was less likely to be observed by the curious fan. She’d also opt for a bucket of popcorn the size of a small child and a soda large enough to drown in.</p><p>But in this instance, the sight of Agatha Harkness striding in hand in hand with her director would be enough to satisfy her.</p><p>Agatha was wearing a pale blue suit with a crisp white shirt and she looked devastating.</p><p>She was beaming as she walked along the row and for a heart-stopping moment she locked eyes with Rio.</p><p>It was brief, and if it had been anyone else looking at her like that, Rio might not have noticed.</p><p>But it was Agatha so she noticed everything.</p><p>She might not have believed she’d even looked her way except for the fact that Agatha knew where she was sitting, because she’d gone to the effort of placing her there.</p><p>But the moment was gone and the filmmakers all had their seats, and Rio realised with a jolt that she could see Agatha still, the blue standing out even as the lights dimmed.</p><p>She was five rows behind her, diagonally positioned so if Rio turned her head only slightly she could stare at the back of Agatha’s head for the next two and a half hours.</p><p>Then Agatha moved as the director stood to introduce the movie to the expectant crowd.</p><p>And Rio could just see her profile.</p><p>The curve of Agatha’s nose was something that even the gods must envy, that Rio wanted to trace it with her fingers and brush it with her lips.</p><p>Agatha was made from something divine, something that mere mortals could only dream of emulating.</p><p>But the director was finishing and the crowd applauded as the lights dimmed completely and Agatha was lost to Rio as she turned back to the front.</p><p>Alice reached for Rio’s hand and squeezed it gently, shooting her a smile as the first titles came on.</p><p>For two hours Rio felt breathless with the intensity of the storyline, of the cinematography.</p><p>The movie unfurled before the silent audience; splitting open like a fresh wound as Agatha portrayed a mother losing a child with such precision that it was almost unbearable to watch.</p><p>Only it wasn’t.</p><p>It was compelling in a way that meant nobody blinked, nobody moved.</p><p>Every fractured breath, every cut to soulful blue eyes, every shot of Agatha bled with emotion. It made Rio grieve with her. Made her yearn to reach that part of her that could produce such a performance.</p><p>It was masterful, it was magic.</p><p>Hauntingly raw and real and remarkable.</p><p>As the camera faded to black after lingering on the final shot of Agatha, lone on a hillside, her wild hair billowing behind her as she stared into the distance, the crowds began to move.</p><p>Like a living beast, they rose together, spreading their thunderous applause through the theatre.</p><p>The cameras rolled in and suddenly Agatha was on the screen, looking more glamorous than she had in the throes of her performance.</p><p>And Rio hollered with the rest of the crowd, her hands already hurting from the ferocity of her applause.</p><p>Alice beside her was on her tiptoes, giving as good as Rio beside her.</p><p>Agatha was beaming, looking every which way but at the camera that stayed intrusively close to her face.</p><p>Whether truly shy or expertly putting on the pretence, she kept her gaze away from the lens and focused on her director, the producer her other side, and then the people directly behind her.</p><p>The standing ovation lasted for fourteen minutes, not a record at Cannes, but close enough.</p><p>As the noise died down, Rio could feel the sting of her hands and her eyes from the tears shed during the screening.</p><p>Alice looked distraught beside her and Rio wondered if it were because the movie had moved her so or because she knew any hope of an Oscar for Rio was dead on arrival.</p><p>The Oscar was surely Agatha’s to take.</p><p>A festival worker came out and instructed those who had press credentials to follow the usher at the exit of the theatre.</p><p>And as people began to move, the front row of filmmakers started to exit before everyone, Rio turned to see Agatha looking up at her, her blue eyes questioning and Rio just shook her head in disbelief down at her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a grin that Rio matched and even as her director tried for Agatha’s attention her eyes lingered on Rio for a few seconds longer before she turned away.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said close to her ear, “I’m going to sneak in. Go back to the hotel. Stay in the room. Order up lunch. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, feeling Alice gently push her towards the exit.</p><p>Rio was one of the few who left ahead of the press conference and without Alice to tell her otherwise, she refused the ride back to the hotel and instead took the scenic route home.</p><p>She needed some air to shake off the lingering impact of the movie.</p><p>And the fresh, crisp air of the town soothed her down from where her her mind was still with Agatha’s character in the depths of her grief.</p><p>Rio knew that she was a good actress. she knew she could command a stage and wow a cast and crew with her talent - especially when earlier on in her career she’d been typecast as a manic pixie dream girl, an actress who could play sexy whilst being a ‘cool girl’.</p><p>“Beautiful but doesn’t know was often in her earlier character descriptions somewhere.</p><p>She, and Alice, had rallied against it until, eventually, she’d been handed a breakout role in a little indie film only two years ago.</p><p>The director, female because of course, had seen something in her that Rio hadn’t even seen in herself.</p><p>The role was grittier, darker than she’d ever played. And although it didn’t get much awards attention, an Indie Spirit being the only award Rio was nominated for (though there was <em>some</em> buzz), it had allowed her access to the Hollywood elite.</p><p>She’d been considered suddenly by directors and producers, and even fellow actors were beginning to take notice.</p><p>So Rio had spent the last two years moving from film set to film set, terrified that she’d lose her chance if she didn’t work her ass off.</p><p>But Agatha, and Rio hated that she knew this, hated that she’d read her Wikipedia several times, was built for this and her name had been in the Awards circuit for practically as long as she’d been in the industry.</p><p>She came from a wealthy family, went to all the best schools, knew all the right people.</p><p>But she could also act rings around anyone she was on screen with.</p><p>And <em>No Heaven Like This</em> truly was her ultimate triumph. A perfect combination of a director knowing what to do with everything she could give and the indefatigable talent of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And though Rio wanted to speak to her, to pick her brains to try to unravel and understand how she ticked, how she could possibly have achieved such greatness, she knew she’d be a bumbling mess in front of her if she spoke now.</p><p>So the sea breeze was a welcome balm to her crazed mind.</p><p>Maybe she could write her a note. Maybe that would be how she could get across just how in awe of her she was.</p><p>But it wasn’t exactly the ‘cool girl’ thing to do, so Rio turned onto the main drag before the beach and began to consider how she could ever revert to type in the presence of Agatha Harkness and be cool enough to be able to speak to her as not some fawning fangirl with a crush but as a peer with some talent of her own.</p><p>A peer whose own movie was premiering the next day.</p><p>“Hey! Hey! Rio!”</p><p>Rio startled some from where she’d been focused on the horizon line as she walked to towards the beach. Torn from her idle thoughts of Agatha by a male voice.</p><p>She turned and raised her brows at the sight of a tall man, manoeuvring his way clumsily around the woven chairs outside a chic little cafe to get to her.</p><p>Ralph.</p><p>“Hey, you alone? Come join me! Coffee’s good!”</p><p>Rio had no chance to refuse as she was treated to a megawatt smile and the chivalrous offer of a seat pulled out for her at one of the little tables where Ralph had clearly been enjoying a coffee and a pastry on his own.</p><p>“Thank you,” she muttered softly, taking a seat and brushing down her little dress over her thighs.</p><p>“Were you at the premier?” He asked with that same grin plastered across his face.</p><p>This must work on other women, she thought.</p><p>Must work on Agatha.</p><p>“I was. Didn’t feel like it?”</p><p>The waiter appeared by her side and offered a menu. Rio took it and smiled her thanks before focusing back in on Ralph who’d taken it upon himself to order for her: “Two champagnes, please. Merci.”</p><p>Ralph’s French word of thanks was spoken with the kind of cloying American crassness that made Rio cringe but she kept her smile up on her face, refusing to be accused of being impolite to the husband of the woman who had just done her an inexplicable favour.</p><p>“Merci,” she repeated, with a much more agreeable accent than Ralph’s.</p><p>The waiter disappeared and Rio turned expectantly back to the man who’d ordered alcohol for her at eleven in the morning.</p><p>“Champagne?”</p><p>“When in Rome!” He said with a grin, leaning back in his chair and slipping his glasses back onto his face.</p><p>He looked even more handsome.</p><p>Rio hated him.</p><p>“But no. Never really been a movie fan.”</p><p>“Your wife is one of the most celebrated actresses of-…”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s her thing. I’d never expect her to come to one of my conferences.”</p><p>Rio had to fight to keep her face neutral, unsure how Ralph could compare a financial conference to the premier of one of the best movies ever put on the silver screen.</p><p>“Well you missed out. She was incredible. <em>It</em> was incredible,” she corrected herself.</p><p>“I’ve heard,” he said with a bored lilt to his voice.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and tilted her head as she took in the luckiest son of a bitch in the world.</p><p>This guy should be worshipping the ground Agatha walked on. He should be singing her praises and following her around ready to give her everything and anything she needed.</p><p>And here he was, in a seafront cafe, sitting ordering champagne with another woman, barely acknowledging Agatha’s impressive career.</p><p>Or how beautiful she was.</p><p>Or the way her eyes sparkled when she smiled.</p><p>Or how soft her hands were.</p><p>Or how-…</p><p>Ralph was speaking again.</p><p>“So, Rio. Is that your real name? Or a stage name? Like Elton John?”</p><p>The waiter arrived and delivered the champagne with a smile. Rio thanked him in soft French while Ralph said nothing.</p><p>“It’s my real name.”</p><p>“Different,” he said absently, though Rio felt his gaze drop slightly further south of her face and she took a sip of her champagne just to have something to do.</p><p>Just so she wouldn’t slap him.</p><p>It was as she turned her gaze to the view of the beach before them that she noticed something she should have been more cognisant of.</p><p>Something that should have made her second guess sitting down in the first place.</p><p>Something that should have made her refuse the champagne.</p><p>Across the way there were three photographers all with their eyes on the little twosome outside the cafe, all with their cameras hanging around their necks.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Sitting having a champagne with the husband of Agatha Harkness whilst she was in the middle of a press conference wasn’t a good look.</p><p>“Ralph,” Rio said suddenly, “I think I should go. I shouldn’t have sat down. There’s paps over there and-…”</p><p>But Ralph had reached forwards and placed his hand over Rio’s and Rio just knew that if the photographers had been waiting for their shot then this was it.</p><p>She pulled her hand away quickly.</p><p>“Come on, don’t deny me the chance to drink champagne with a pretty girl by the sea.”</p><p>Perhaps Ralph himself should have been enough deterrent for her to sit down.</p><p>“I should go.”</p><p>She stood quickly and Ralph didn’t stand with her as she did.</p><p>“Thanks for the champagne.”</p><p>Through his glasses Rio thought she saw Ralph’s eyes flash angrily but she didn’t hang around to see.</p><p>She simply turned away and strode off, deciding that perhaps she should do now what Alice had told her to do earlier.</p><p>She should go to her hotel room and do nothing.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>Only doing nothing meant she had time to worry about what had just happened with Ralph.</p><p>Which seemed crazy, no? She was out and proud - one of the few actresses to be so.</p><p>They couldn’t spin this, surely.</p><p>They couldn’t make out that Rio was having an affair with the great Agatha Harkness’s husband.</p><p>But, of course they could.</p><p>Rivals at the festival, rivals in awards season, Rio could be made out to be trying to sabotage Agatha’s relationship to get under her skin.</p><p>Alice would kill her.</p><p>But more than that, more than her impending murder and her character assassination by the pestilential press, was her concern over Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>The woman had gone out of her way to get Rio and Alice the hottest tickets in town.</p><p>And Rio had spent the length of the movie marvelling at her talent, stupefied by the force of her gravitational pull even through the screen.</p><p>And now she’d repaid her by embarrassing her.</p><p>Alice arrived an hour later and Rio hated that she was so happy because she knew she wouldn’t be when Rio told her what she’d done.</p><p>“God she nails it every time. She’s so fucking good, Rio. So fucking good. You wouldn’t believe how she handled those questions.”</p><p>But Alice had spotted Rio’s tortured expression and stopped where she was mid-stride, “What? What happened?”</p><p>“I think they got pictures of me and Ralph.”</p><p>“Ralph?”</p><p>“Ralph. Agatha’s Ralph.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows, unable to compute what Rio might have been caught doing with Ralph that would lead to this reaction.</p><p>“We had champagne on the front and he held my hand. Very! Very briefly! But I spotted the photographers and I just <em>know</em>…”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. I told you to come straight back.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and ran both hands through her hair which looked significantly more dishevelled than it had this morning.</p><p>Alice was already fishing out her phone.</p><p>“He stopped me and I thought we’d just get a coffee and then he-…”</p><p>“I’ll call Jen. I knew your flirting would get us in trouble one day but-…”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em> flirting, Alice. He’s a <em>man</em>, in case you hadn’t noticed. And he’s with Agatha. He’s married to Agatha Harkness! I don’t do married and I’d be a fucking fool to-…!”</p><p>“Okay, okay. Fine. Relax. It was innocent. I’ll call now. Just… just don’t move.”</p><p>Rio threw herself down onto one of the ridiculously large couches and groaned as Alice turned from her and quickly dialled for Jen.</p><p>Rio knew she was already on thin ice with the woman so she could only imagine her reaction to <em>this</em>.</p><p>And then she imagined Agatha’s reaction. The only reaction she found herself caring much about.</p><p>But Alice had gone into the other room and so Rio was left to her catastrophising.</p><p>It didn’t take long until she found out how much of a catastrophe this was.</p><p>“Okay. Jen’s pissed. She’s speaking to Agatha about it but she’s in press all day so it’s unlikely we’ll find out just how pissed <em>she</em> is but if it helps at all, Jen thinks she’ll mostly be mad at Ralph.”</p><p>Rio sighed and threw her forearm over her eyes, feeling like the stupidest person on the world.</p><p>“I don’t even like men,” she mumbled unhappily.</p><p>“Well our dinner with the Head of MGM has been moved.”</p><p>“Moved?”</p><p>Rio sat up suddenly, staring at Alice in surprise. Alice had worked hard to get that dinner booked into their schedule so Rio suddenly knew she’d <em>really</em> fucked up.</p><p>“Alice-…”</p><p>“Moved restaurant,” Alice clarified, taking a seat by Rio’s feet and focusing on her phone.</p><p>“Agatha’s also out for dinner. We’re arranging a happenstance meeting between you two. Getting a photographer to capture it. You’re going to smile and hug and pretend like you’re the best of friends.”</p><p>Rio swallowed down something heavy in her throat. It felt a lot like her heart.</p><p>“Jen’s a genius,” Alice added with just a hint of smugness about it.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Ralph will be there too. A quick two kiss cheek. Polite, friendly. There’s no story here.”</p><p>Rio paled a little as she watched her friend in silence, watching the little frown appear between her brows.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Alice. I didn’t mean to. It was just… I was being polite.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice said softly, “I told Jen.”</p><p>She looked up and Rio knew then that Alice wasn’t mad anymore. She felt a little better.</p><p>“Do you think she’ll be mad?”</p><p>“She has a reputation for a reason.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and felt the light pressure of a hand on her calf, “Hey. We’ll spin the close friend narrative.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened again as Alice removed her hand from her leg but she saw she was still looking at her.</p><p>“How did you convince her to get you those tickets?”</p><p>“I have no idea. I barely remember telling her we hadn’t managed to get any.”</p><p>“Well however you charmed her last night you’ll just have to charm her again.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and then flopped onto her back again and sighed heavily, “Fuck. Fucking paps. Should be illegal.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Alice said quietly, “What’s a married man doing holding the hand of a young actress?”</p><p>Rio felt a white hot fury flash through her suddenly. The reminder of Ralph’s disinterest in his wife’s work making her feel anger like never before.</p><p>Alice was right. This was <em>Ralph’s</em> fault.</p><p>“He wasn’t exactly fawning over her. Had no interest in her movie.”</p><p>“Prick,” Alice said as she turned her attention back to her phone. “I get that he’s hot and rich but… so’s she. She could get anyone.”</p><p>Rio just hummed quietly, closing her eyes again as she thought back to the way Agatha had grinned at her at the premiere.</p><p>She’d probably never get that treatment from her again.</p><p>Rio couldn’t shake the dread at seeing Agatha for the rest of the day.</p><p>Even Alice’s gentle reassurances didn’t help. Alice was convinced that Rio could turn this whole thing around with her easy charm.</p><p>Or maybe she was just saying that to get Rio through the afternoon’s press round.</p><p>Because Rio hadn’t known how she’d charmed Agatha into getting them tickets in the first place so Rio was less sure she’d be able to do it again.</p><p>In fact, by the time they were pulling up to the restaurant, Rio was convinced the best thing she could do would be to turn around and take the first flight out of Cannes.</p><p>“You’re being hysterical.”</p><p>“You said it yourself: Agatha has a reputation for a reason.”</p><p>“She won’t do anything in public. And I’ll know from Jen by the time we go to bed how she’s feeling. Just try to relax, okay? You need to be convincing. <em>And</em> you need to be at the top of your game for MGM. So suck it up, buttercup.”</p><p>Rio huffed and began toying with her hair which made Alice slap her hand.</p><p>But press waits for no woman. And so Rio Vidal <em>had</em> to suck it up.</p><p>She thankfully was partnered with her director for the majority of the afternoon’s interviews so had someone to rely upon whenever she felt like she was flagging or her mind was drifting to the other rooms in the hotel where surely Agatha was answering similar, boring questions.</p><p>They had time to change and refresh makeup once the last of the interviews was done, but no glam squad this time.</p><p>Which meant that Rio crowded Alice in her little bathroom and kept prying to see if she knew just how mad Agatha was.</p><p>Alice knew nothing. Only that Agatha would be in the restaurant already by the time they arrived.</p><p>So, when Rio stepped out onto the sidewalk not twenty minutes later after a short journey from the hotel to the restaurant, she found that her body moved without her brain having to tell her to do so.</p><p>The maitre d’ greeted her and Alice and Rio only had to raise her head to see a pair of familiar eyes on her.</p><p>Agatha was wearing the same suit she’d had on that morning for the premiere only she’d draped her jacket over the back of her chair and had rolled her white sleeves up to her elbows.</p><p>Rio’s gaze fell to her forearms and she saw them flex slightly where she sat, and found herself wishing she’d strangle her just so she could see them do that up close.</p><p>Ralph was beside her and an unknown man sat opposite her, beside Jen.</p><p>Agatha raised from her seat as Rio and Alice approached and she smiled a smile that made Rio’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha announced making Rio almost stumble where she got closer.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Agatha had wrapped her arms around her and Rio couldn’t believe that Agatha Harkness was pressed against her all of a sudden.</p><p>She’d expected a typical European greeting of a two cheek kiss and had prepared herself for <em>that</em> but not this.</p><p>Not Agatha’s strong hold and the fingers that rested on the skin at the base of her neck, the hand on her lower back, pressing her close.</p><p>Rio was sure Agatha would be able to feel her heart beating erratically against her ribcage, beating so hard and fast as if it were trying to escape its cage and nestle in beside Agatha’s.</p><p>But she managed to wrap her arms around Agatha too, holding on just enough so she didn’t look as surprised and useless as she felt.</p><p>“Smile,” came a voice close to her ear, soft and gentle, just for her, “pretend you’re happy to see me.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio murmured back, feeling Agatha already pulling away when Rio could have held onto her like this forever.</p><p>She managed to keep her smile on her face as Agatha pulled her top half away, their hips pressed together in a hold that made Rio flush a little at the intimacy of it.</p><p>Agatha looked at her curiously, and it was a sign of her talent as an actress that she managed to maintain her grin.</p><p>“What are the chances.”</p><p>Rio forced a laugh that sounded, to her ringing ears, genuine.</p><p>And then Agatha was releasing her hold on her and Rio knew it was her cue to go to Ralph and greet him too.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand drift down her arm as she stepped around her and was surprised when she felt soft fingers curl around her own and squeeze her as she leant up to kiss the cheeks of the man that had caused this mess.</p><p>Her greeting of Ralph was practised politeness and by the look on his face, she knew he’d been warned that two light kisses to Rio’s cheeks were all he’d be allowed to do.</p><p>But if he’d stuck his tongue down her throat, Rio wouldn’t have even noticed, because Agatha still had her hand. The hold was so light, so tentative around her fingers that she wasn’t sure who now was holding on to who.</p><p>But Alice had moved in and was motioning for Rio to follow her so she only had time to shoot Jen and the unnamed man a quick smile before she stepped away.</p><p>Her hand remained in Agatha’s as she swept past and their hold on each other only dropped when Rio stepped from around her.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure why she’d done it but maybe it was a means of making sure she were anchoring Rio away from her husband, of reminding her of her place.</p><p>Still, her fingers tingled with the electricity of Agatha’s touch even as they now hung useless at her side.</p><p>But they’d stepped away to the table in the corner and as Rio sat down opposite Alice, her best friend whispered across at her: “Nicely done. He got the shots.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, flexing her fingers subtly over the table as she tried to calm her still racing heart.</p><p>From where they now sat waiting on their guest, Rio had a direct view of Agatha if she turned to the left.</p><p>It was too tempting. And so she didn’t.</p><p>She kept her gaze on Alice, on the table, on her water glass, on anything but the woman she so badly wanted to look across at.</p><p>Within five minutes, Rio’s heart rate had calmed down again and their guest had arrived.</p><p>Unfortunately for Rio, she had to look up when he did and saw that he’d stopped at Agatha’s table to greet the future two-time Oscar winner.</p><p>Just a few hours, Rio thought to herself as she watched Agatha kiss the man’s cheeks, and smile up at him, until she’d know how badly she’d fucked up.</p><p>She’d find out how angry Agatha truly was.</p><p>And whether she’d ever get to hug her again.</p><p><em>Pathetic</em>, she thought more bitterly, clenching her teeth as she saw Agatha introduce Ralph to one of the most important men in Hollywood.</p><p>It was two minutes later, as Ralph reached over to shake the hand of Tony Stark, that she caught Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Rio sucked a sharp breath in, seeing that Agatha’s smile had indeed been fake earlier.</p><p>Because right now she looked less than happy, she looked angry.</p><p>Rio looked away quickly, unable to handle the guilt that settled in her stomach.</p><p>But Stark was soon at their table and Rio had to push whatever she felt about her current situation down to focus in on the man who could make or break careers.</p><p>She’d met Stark before, had even had a drink with him once at a party. But this was the first time she’d had his undivided attention for a whole hour and a half: as promised by his wife and right hand woman, Pepper.</p><p>Rio had no problem being charming for Stark and found his easy manners and bawdy wit to be a welcome distraction from her horror that she’d managed to burn down a tentative friendship with her longest running crush with a misjudged attempt at being polite.</p><p>With a promise to keep in touch with Alice, Stark left and Rio was lavished with compliments by her best friend for her ability to charm the pants off of anyone.</p><p>Which felt ironic to Rio as she was so tragically aware that Agatha were still at dinner just a few feet away, furious with her.</p><p>“She’s pissed,” Rio whispered, ignoring Alice’s compliments.</p><p>Alice’s smile froze on her face and then she shot a quick glance around at Agatha’s table, seeing that whoever they’d been with before had gone and left just the three people there.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>“Alice, <em>no</em>.”</p><p>“Come on. Best do it now.”</p><p>And Alice was moving so Rio had no choice but to follow.</p><p>She hung back a little, unwilling to be exposed to Agatha’s wrath when she’d started the morning with a different belief about the state of their relationship.</p><p>“Hey, how was your meal?”</p><p>Rio cringed at Alice’s opening line and settled by her side, wondering why she’d had two glasses of red and not any tequila.</p><p>Or arsenic.</p><p>“Well as planned pap shots go it was the most delicious,” Jen offered with a smile as she took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“I’m sorry about that,” Rio said quickly, suddenly desperate to get her guilt off her chest.</p><p>“I didn’t-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio glanced down to see Agatha swirling her glass of wine, her gaze somewhere off in the distance.</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and leant across the table to Alice, her hand landing just inches from where she stood, “I’ll call you later, okay?”</p><p>Rio reacted sooner than Alice did and reached for her friend’s arm, tugging her away quickly so they could disappear from this ill-advised interaction.</p><p>They paused briefly at the maitre d’ and Alice quickly paid the bill, both now avoiding looking back at the three people they’d just hurried away from.</p><p>They were silent on the journey back to their hotel, both lost in their own thoughts of the relationships that they may have lost due to a miscalculation.</p><p>When they arrived back to their room Rio wondered why she felt so sick with the idea of Agatha being angry at her.</p><p>She’d not technically done anything wrong. She’d only put herself in a stupid situation. She’d only tried to be polite to a man she would otherwise rather ignore, potentially punch.</p><p>Agatha must know that.</p><p>Agatha can’t have thought she’d be cruel enough or stupid enough to try something with her husband.</p><p>Alice looked as if she were suffering as much as Rio was and for that reason, when they arrived back in the suite, Rio excused herself and went to take a long hot bath.</p><p>She couldn’t handle the fact that she may have also ruined Alice’s chance at a relationship with Jen.</p><p>She stayed soaking for close to two hours, constantly topping up the bath with hot water so she could prolong the inevitable - facing Alice again.</p><p>By the time she’d summoned up the courage to step back into their shared living space Alice had also been soaking in her own tub for a while, she looked up at Rio with a small, sad frown.</p><p>“I haven’t heard from Jen yet.”</p><p>Rio only nodded silently and went to take a seat beside Alice on the couch, reaching an arm around her to pull her into her side.</p><p>“Jen is totally head over heels for you. She-…”</p><p>There was a faint knock at the door and both women on the couch looked up in surprise.</p><p>Alice moved over, squeezing Rio’s thigh as she pushed herself up and Rio sat forwards having a hunch who it might be knocking on their door so late at night.</p><p>She was right.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said, a little breathlessly, and Rio wandered if she were nervous and if she’d been as worried about her future relationship with Alice as Alice had been.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>Alice could only nod and Rio felt a twang of affection for her best friend.</p><p>“Rio. Hey.”</p><p>Rio nodded and stood, placing her hands in the back pockets of her shorts.</p><p>“Jen. How is… is everything okay?”</p><p>Jen glanced at Alice and then nodded, taking it upon herself to move further into the room and take a seat at the couch opposite where Rio was.</p><p>Alice hesitated for a second before she went to take a seat by Rio and Jen cleared her throat a little at this choice but swallowed down whatever she was about to say and replaced it with: “Agatha’s pissed but she’s mostly pissed at Ralph. She thinks you’re a fool, obviously, but… she’s pissed at Ralph.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart leap into her throat as she stared across at Jen, vaguely aware that she was now telling Alice about a call she’d made to her press contacts, about how she’d sourced the photographers who’d taken the photos and firstly talked them down and secondly bought the photos off them - for a much lower price than they were initially going to try and flog them for.</p><p>“I… wait,” Rio said suddenly, her brain still focused on the most important news - that Agatha wasn’t annoyed at her.</p><p>“You got the photos?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then… they won’t run the photos of us in the restaurant either?”</p><p>“No. There’s no need. Agatha’s reputation is safe and yours is fine too.”</p><p>Rio started a little, wondering if she could get a hold of those photos. Wondering if she could get Agatha to sign them. Wondering if Agatha would ever hold her like that again.</p><p>“So… so she’s not mad.”</p><p>“Oh, she’s mad. Ralph’s flying back home tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her hands, distractedly cracking her knuckles as she thought this over.</p><p>“Did he make a move?”</p><p>Rio felt Alice shift beside her, her hand unconsciously reaching for Rio’s wrist, whether in a protective move or to stop her cracking her knuckles, Rio wasn’t sure. Maybe both.</p><p>“A move? I… no. Does Agatha think he did?”</p><p>“He held your hand… it’s logical to think he may have made a move.”</p><p>And then Rio realised why Agatha had held her hand earlier.</p><p>She’d been worried Ralph had made a move and Rio would be concerned it might happen again.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Rio’s mind was reeling, her whole body felt hot suddenly and she stood up from her couch, striding from the room to stand out on the balcony where at least she could get some air.</p><p>Not only had she almost caused a PR disaster for Agatha Harkness but she’d almost ruined a marriage.</p><p>She’d fantasised about Agatha being suddenly single, suddenly interested.</p><p>But the reality was different.</p><p>Everyone knew that Agatha and Ralph were a golden couple.</p><p>Rio had a crush but she wasn’t selfish enough to want them to break up.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>“God,” she heard from just behind her, “actresses are so dramatic.”</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder at Jen and raised her brows.</p><p>The woman stood watching her with her arms crossed over her chest, her cell phone clutched in one beautifully manicured hand.</p><p>“Ralph is a good guy… mostly. But he sometimes looks… sometimes touches… Agatha mostly turns a blind eye but… anyway.”</p><p>Rio sighed and turned back around to look out across the water. She realised she was being a little dramatic but she couldn’t help it.</p><p>It was her job, after all.</p><p>If Agatha turned a blind eye to Ralph, would Ralph turn a blind eye to Agatha too?</p><p>Was Agatha sleeping around on the side? Would Agatha sleep around with her?</p><p>But, no. Now wasn’t the time to fantasise.</p><p>She was barley friends with Agatha and Agatha had given her no reason for Rio to believe she was anything other than straight anyway.</p><p>Except for one drunken memory of a night in Chicago. But even that was too hazy to be anything real.</p><p>Besides, this whole thing had ruined what she had hoped would continue to be a confusing, difficult, but totally enthralling relationship.</p><p>Because despite it all, she wanted Agatha Harkness to like her.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said from somewhere close by, “You did nothing wrong. And now it’s fixed. Relax, okay? And next time don’t sit with another famous actress’s spouse drinking champagne in one of the most photographed towns in the world.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned around again and in doing so she caught the look exchanged between Jen and Alice and she had to soften.</p><p>They looked so in love it was impossible not to soften with it.</p><p>Her best friend was an idiot for thinking Jen might not be interested.</p><p>“Will you tell Agatha I’m sorry? And that… that I loved her movie?”</p><p>Jen’s face changed as she looked around to Rio and she scoffed before she turned her attention to her phone and Rio knew that a woman who worked for Agatha Harkness would surely be busy every minute of the day.</p><p>“Tell her yourself. Alice, I should go. Agatha wants to prep for tomorrow.”</p><p>Jen looked up then and dropped her phone slightly, “But drinks? Tomorrow evening?”</p><p>Rio felt suddenly like she shouldn’t be here but with the door blocked back into the suite she could do nothing but turn back to the sea.</p><p>She held her breath and brought her arms in as her forearms leant on the barrier, trying to shrink herself so Jen and Alice could have some privacy.</p><p>“I… yeah! I’d love that.”</p><p>“Good. I’ll drop you a text later. We’re non-stop all day tomorrow but I should have most of the evening free.”</p><p>“Cool. I mean, great. I… yeah. Cool.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look around but she grinned to herself as she heard Jen laugh quietly and turned only when she heard Jen leave and shout over her shoulder back at her.</p><p>“Bye, Rio! Fuck up again and I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Rio raised her middle finger at the woman and smirked when she glowered at her but she caught her lips twitching.</p><p>Maybe Alice was rubbing off on her. Maybe Jen was just softer than she looked.</p><p>But Rio went back to the view so she didn’t have to see Alice fumble her way through a goodbye, or even a kiss.</p><p>Less than thirty seconds later and she felt arms around her neck and a grinning idiot of a best friend pressing her face into her hair.</p><p>“She asked me out. You heard that? Like… for drinks. On a date.”</p><p>Rio only laughed in response and grasped Alice’s hands.</p><p>“Yes, I heard.”</p><p>Alice moved around and made Rio turn to her, holding her arms as she did.</p><p>“<em>You</em> are a fool if you think she’s not entirely into you.”</p><p>“I thought <em>you</em> were the fool today.”</p><p>Rio grinned and rolled her eyes, “I’m going to write her a note. And send a gift.”</p><p>“How very romantic of you. Be sure to sign it ‘from your biggest fan, sorry about trying to fuck your husband’.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks colour slightly but she ignored it and ignored Alice’s teasing grin as she moved back into the safety of the living room.</p><p>“Besides, you should actually be praising me for the number I did on Stark. I think he liked me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Alice said with a slow smile, “I’ve already heard from Potts. He <em>does</em> like you and he’s keeping you in mind for his next few projects.”</p><p>Rio whipped around so quickly she almost lost her balance.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Do I ever joke about work?”</p><p>Rio huffed and then threw herself onto the couch.</p><p>“Sooo,” Alice continued in a slightly softer tone than before, moving around to stand before Rio and shrugging her light blazer off. “All <em>you</em> need to do is behave for the next few days. And be nice to Agatha. I want you back on her good side. And,” she draped herself on a nearby chair as Rio turned to look at her, “I might treat you.”</p><p>“Treat me?”</p><p>Alice hummed and tried to fight the smirk that threatened to give her away, but Rio knew her friend too well.</p><p>“Well… we’ve barely had a break for two years and we actually have a couple days free so I was considering taking you away.”</p><p>“Away?” Rio sat bolt up right and stared at Alice, feeling suddenly like a child promised the largest of the cookies available on the counter.</p><p>“If you get more than ten minutes’ ovation. I’ll take you away.”</p><p>“You can’t promise something and then put caveats on it.”</p><p>“Gives you something to focus on rather than spiralling about Agatha Harkness plotting to kill you.”</p><p>“You think she is?”</p><p>Alice laughed at the look of panic on Rio’s face and shook her head, “Jen said she’s just pissed at Ralph. She probably already knows you’re an idiot and nothing more. You're no real threat to Agatha Harkness, come on. I bet she barely thinks about you at all.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and threw herself back again. “Whatever. <em>I</em> got into the screening. You should be thanking me.”</p><p>Alice hummed and then laughed, “Fine. I’ll treat you. With your credit card, of course. But a couple days vacation I think will be good for us, don’t you think?”</p><p>“God,” Rio said with a grin, “I knew I loved you. I just never realised how much until this very moment.”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Alice said as she tucked her legs beneath her and reached for her nearby laptop, “I’ll find us somewhere nice. But you should go to sleep. Movie’s released tomorrow. Glam are coming first thing because you need to look <em>perfect</em> for your debut.”</p><p>Rio sighed and stood up.</p><p>“Make sure it’s luxurious.”</p><p>“Oh, it will be. It’s <em>your</em> credit card, remember?”</p><p>Rio only rolled her eyes and went to leave the room, thinking only now of the soft embrace of her bed.</p><p>But the sleep she so craved didn’t quite come.</p><p>Blue eyes and an angry stare were all she could think of and her worried mind didn’t relent until it was too late and her alarm was ringing as Alice kamikazed into her room.</p><p>“Up! Up!”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, having had maybe half an hour’s proper sleep all night.</p><p>A point that Alice picked up on immediately.</p><p>“Holy shit, did you sleep <em>at all</em>?”</p><p>Rio groaned, not having the energy to argue with Alice when she could barely lift herself from the bed.</p><p>“Maybe I should have booked more than just the four of them.”</p><p>“Shut. <em>Up</em>. This is my big day, you’re supposed to be nice to me on my big day.”</p><p>“I’d be nicer if you had done me a favour and not looked like absolute-…”</p><p>But Rio shot Alice a look and her best friend softened.</p><p>“Fine. Whatever. Shower and change and be out in ten. They’re coming soon and we’ll need all the time we can get.”</p><p>With that, Alice flew from the room, and Rio was left to her tired mind and nervous body.</p><p>All hopes of the highest honour of her industry rested on today. She needed the critics to rise to their feet and applaud her, to confirm that all the hype had been real and she wasn’t just some flash in a pan when Agatha was still the whole damn meal.</p><p>So she showered and fought down her fear of being a failure before she’d even begun.</p><p>Faint concerns about Agatha’s wrath filled her subconscious still but she had no time for concerns about that when she was being poked and pulled and painted.</p><p>She forced herself to make small talk, tried her best to concentrate when Alice was prepping her for the who’s who of the press who would be front and centre, and tried to focus in on the actress she knew she could be and not the flaming mess she currently felt.</p><p>Usually confident, calm, collected, Rio stepped from the black SUV with a nauseating feeling that she was walking to the gallows.</p><p>She could barely see for the flashes of cameras that surrounded her.</p><p>The only thing now grounding her to the moment was the rough feel of her director’s hand in her own, the soft whispers of “just wait, Rio. just you wait”.</p><p>His confidence was annoying.</p><p>His belief that what they’d made together were worthy of anything made her feel worse because if he were wrong then he would be crushed.</p><p>But they were stepping into the theatre now, with it’s high bolted ceilings and the grand sweep of seats around them.</p><p>Rio’s smile was plastered on her face and she felt like one of those marionettes taken out to dance for her crowd.</p><p>She didn’t dare to look around, couldn’t bear to see the amount of people looking at her, expectant that she would dazzle them.</p><p>“Just people, Rio,” Alice always said, “Look at their faces. Just people.”</p><p>But Rio was at her seat now, her hand empty where her director had released it to deliver his mawkish and self-aggrandising introduction.</p><p>She felt small in her seat, felt like she’d shrunk an inch or two as her shoulders rose close to her ears.</p><p>She wished she could run, or that Alice had been able to sit beside her.</p><p>She wanted to be swallowed whole by the black screen in front that threatened to show her face to the world, threatened to destroy her career with the too-high expectations on her.</p><p>But then there was an outbreak of applause and Rio saw her director motion to her, waving his hands at her to bring her up, to spin her around and to show her to the room.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and almost choked on it as she was shown off to the most influential journalists in the industry.</p><p>And there, sitting beside Jen in the middle of the sea of beaming faces was Agatha.</p><p>The applause seemed to slow, seemed to merge into one, heavy crash of hands.</p><p>Agatha was looking directly at her, her own hands moving in tandem with those around her, her eyebrows raised almost as if she was wondering why she were there herself, her smile widening the longer Rio stared.</p><p>And more devastating than anything that had happened to Rio that week, she winked.</p>

<p>Two hours and twenty four minutes.</p><p>That was how long Rio didn’t breathe for.</p><p>A new record, she thought.</p><p>At least one thing to be proud of.</p><p>Because she could no longer be objective about her performance. She could no longer believe what everyone had been telling her for weeks.</p><p>All she could see was herself playing dress up on the fifty foot screen before her.</p><p>The rough, calloused pads of her director’s fingers were brushing her knuckles every now and then and that was the only thing that kept Rio from bolting.</p><p>She wanted Alice. And she wanted to be alone.</p><p>The screening ended, the movie faded to black.</p><p>The credits rolled.</p><p>There was silence for a beat.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath.</p><p>The lights went on.</p><p>The noise started.</p><p>All around her the jubilant, thunderous applause began.</p><p>She was wrenched from her seat by her director and pulled into his arms without warning.</p><p>The noise seemed to intensify suddenly, as if her brain could initially only handle part of it and had now finally given in to all of it.</p><p>But when she was released she noticed the camera was in her face already and she had to force a smile but noticed the tears forming in her eyes must be real.</p><p>She hadn’t forced those.</p><p>The camera stayed and she saw herself reflected in it, felt the hands jostling her shoulders and squeezing her waist.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Her forced smile became real like a sudden morning light through the dusk.</p><p>Her audience was applauding her still, and Rio took a shot and turned to see, blinking owlishly to avoid letting her tears fall as her grin grew at the sight of her admirers.</p><p>Maybe the press and Alice had been right. Maybe she had a chance.</p><p>Alice was the first person she saw.</p><p>And Rio almost lost control right then and there because her best friend was crying real, proper tears.</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched at the sight and she wanted to clamber up the two rows to get to her but all she could do was grin back at her, trying to convey to her that it was her win too.</p><p>She dared then to turn and see the rest of the crowd when she could no longer stomach watching her best friend when she couldn’t reach her.</p><p>There were faces she recognised and faces she didn’t; there were grins and smiled and appraising eyes on her from every angle.</p><p>And then there was Jennifer Kale, clapping along but leaning over and whispering urgently into the ear of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio caught her eye and felt her smile grow impossibly wider at the sight.</p><p>There were at least a thousand people there all clapping for Rio.</p><p>But Agatha was clapping for her too.</p><p>Agatha was smiling at her.</p><p>A hand wrapped around her waist and she was turned back around, but she looked back, just once, and over her shoulder she winked at Agatha, returning the gesture from before.</p><p>It felt heady; this new confidence she had.</p><p>She felt like she would conquer the world, like she could have anything she wanted, woo the woman who had no interest in her.</p><p>The applause lasted what felt like a lifetime after that and Rio’s cheeks felt so sore from all the smiling.</p><p>But her heart was full and she felt the drunk on the applause. And Rio recognised the secret part of herself that longed to look back at Agatha to confirm that she had been clapping, that she had been smiling, and how she’d reacted to her wink.</p><p>But as the applause began to die down, Rio was ushered out with the rest of the cast and crew and she faced straight ahead under the pretence of being cool, calm, confident.</p><p>There wasn’t time for Alice to get to her before she was ushered to her seat along the long table at the front of the little press room and Rio already felt the familiar glare of the cameras flashing all around her before the room was even half full.</p><p>“You ready for this, Vidal?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and grinned at her costar, leaning in conspiratorially to whisper to him as they took their places.</p><p>“Born ready, baby.”</p><p>Rio found Alice in the sea of faces and grinned at her as the questions began to come thick and fast.</p><p>Rio’s freshly acquired earpiece translated the languages other than English spoken in the room and this was working well until a Spanish reporter asked a question aimed at her costar.</p><p>“¿Te resultó distraído trabajar con Rio?”</p><p>“<em>Did you find it distracting working with Rio?</em>”</p><p>Only the translation that came through Rio’s earpiece wasn’t exactly right.</p><p>What Rio heard in English was instead: “Did you enjoy working with Rio?”</p><p>Without thinking, and knowing Alice would kill her if she gaged her response wrong, Rio reached for the arm of her handsome costar to stop him from answering a question that hadn’t been asked.</p><p>“Sorry,” she pulled her earpiece from her ear and looked directly at the reporter as she clarified: “¿Distrayente?” <em>Distracting?</em></p><p>“Sí, ser una mujer hermosa y todo.” <em>Yes, being a beautiful woman and all.</em></p><p>Sexist pig.</p><p>Rio could feel Alice’s eyes burning into her but she couldn’t look away because she’d lose her nerve.</p><p>“Uh,” Rio forced out a soft laugh, making herself appear less than the fury that she felt. “Steve, you’re being asked if you found me distracting? Because I’m beautiful?”</p><p>She turned to her costar and wriggled her brows, knowing she’d played it just right because the room tittered with laughter.</p><p>Steve turned to her with a slightly confused and then amused grin and Rio felt like kissing him when he responded easily, “Oh, we had a no eye contact rule so I wouldn’t melt before her and forget my lines. But we managed to make it work.”</p><p>Rio laughed again but this time it was genuine and she shot the room a megawatt grin, finding Alice in the crowd and seeing her shoot a subtle thumbs up.</p><p>Rio poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek and tried not to look too smug as the conversation moved on and talk of Rio distracting costars turned into festival gossip rather than headline fodder.</p><p>Nothing else was lost in translation so far as the rest of the press conference went and when it was over Rio was ushered into a small room where she’d have the opportunity to touch up her makeup and speak to Alice before more interviews were to go ahead.</p><p>“Risky behaviour, kid.”</p><p>“Paid off though,” Rio beamed as she pulled Alice into a tight hug.</p><p>“We’re getting you that Oscar,” Alice whispered into her ear and Rio laughed as she pulled back.</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>“Twelve minutes! Twelve minutes! And Rio, it was so good. Seeing the whole thing, with your performance just…”</p><p>And Alice began to well up.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio smiled as she tenderly swiped her thumbs below Alice’s watery eyes, anticipating the tears that would soon be falling.</p><p>“No crying today. I have about a million hours of interviews today and I can’t be thinking about anything other than ‘how the industry has changed since Me Too’.”</p><p>Alice laughed and pulled away, sniffing heavily so that Rio knew she was now properly crying.</p><p>But she’d been launched at by a makeup artist so couldn’t go after Alice as she kept turned from her and focused in on her phone.</p><p>“Closed lips, please,” came the soft words of the woman now brushing Chanel across her red lips.</p><p>Rio did as she was told and briefly relaxed under the tender care of the expert hired to make her look her best.</p><p>But Alice’s voice floated back into her ears just as she was tilting her head a little more to help the artist at work.</p><p>“By the way, Jen’s pissed. She thinks you’ll take it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned her head so that the makeup artist tutted at her and she grimaced in apology.</p><p>“Wha?” She mumbled, trying not to open her lips too much.</p><p>“She came in with Agatha. Didn’t you see them? Got great seats. Imagine how easy all this would be if we had their power. But she saw it and loved it and she’s pissed because of it.”</p><p>Rio felt a flush of butterflies erupt in her stomach at this. Because if Jen loved it then there was a chance that Agatha did too.</p><p>Only she was trapped by the woman working the curve of her lips and she fought against herself to not just push her off and demand Alice find out Agatha’s opinion.</p><p>Another thirty seconds went by that felt like a lifetime and the woman had moved away to fetch a bronzer from her bag and Rio turned to Alice and said in such a rush that she wondered how Alice had understood her: “And Agatha what did Agatha think of it?”</p><p>Alice turned from where she was now sitting in a little director’s chair behind one of the cameras already set up, “Agatha? I don’t know. I’m sure she liked it. It was great, Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed but said nothing else as she allowed her head to be turned by the makeup artist and her cheeks were painted with bronze.</p><p>She began twisting her hair in her fingers as a means to distract herself from the torturous mystery of Agatha’s opinion on her movie.</p><p>Perhaps her smile in the theatre had been nothing more than a friendly reassurance. Maybe she was smiling because she <em>hated</em> it or thought Rio was unbelievable as a woman on the brink of a breakdown, vulnerable and looking in all the wrong places for reassurance.</p><p>Maybe she just thought she was a hack.</p><p>But Rio sailed through the questions thrown at her - mostly because they were all variations on a theme so it didn’t take my brain power to do it - and she had thirty seconds in between to take a sip of coffee or have her lipstick reapplied.</p><p>Alice remained a silent observer, occasionally reminding Rio of a point she might want to bring up at the next interview or else telling her what bar she might meet Jen at later - the decision always changing.</p><p>And Rio floated through, her mind often elsewhere as she smiled and charmed and chatted.</p><p>She was thinking of the quiet evening she could have with Alice out with Jen.</p><p>She thought of where Alice might whisk her away to on vacation now it was confirmed that she’d had over ten minutes of applause.</p><p>She thought of Agatha now in Cannes alone, living down the hall of their swanky hotel, and the smile she’d given her that morning.</p><p>At around three, Rio was done with the junket and had moved on to a longer form interview with a journalist from <em>Vogue</em> which was to take place in a nearby restaurant.</p><p>Starving now and a little grumpy because of it, it took Alice breaking the surprise of their vacation to get Rio to smile again on their way to the location of the interview.</p><p>“Positano. Two full days, three nights. A little hillside villa with a pool.”</p><p>Rio groaned at the sight of the villa Alice had sent over to her email, flicking lustfully through the images of the place they could disappear to for two whole days.</p><p>“God, Alice. How much is this costing me?”</p><p>“Well I’ve managed to get the fridge filled and the wine fridge filled too so…” she grinned and shrugged, “I’m afraid it’s costing you quite a bit.”</p><p>Rio only laughed and tilted her head back in her seat, taking a second to fantasise about sitting by the pool with a drink in her hand.</p><p>“I don’t even care. I want to be there now.”</p><p>“Soon,” Alice promised with a smug smile as she returned her attention to her overflowing email inbox, “just a few more people to charm and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p>“Easier said than done,” Rio grumbled as the image of herself lying by the pool slowly dissolved in her mind and she was back in an air-conditioned SUV thinking about how to charm the next journalist.</p><p>Rio began to shuffle a little as they reached their destination and Alice took this as a sign that she was beginning to get tired so she placed a hand over her hand and squeezed it.</p><p>“Think of the villa. The vast amounts of wine and two days of uninterrupted pool time with your favourite person.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes but the reminder did help.</p><p>In fact, it helped so much that a promised two hour interview expanded into three and Rio Vidal not only charmed the interviewer, she managed to get a promise of an even longer middle page spread printed of it.</p><p>Alice was so happy about this result that she forgot to be nervous about her impending date with Jen for the rest of the day.</p><p>The only issue was: Rio had barely had a chance to eat anything.</p><p>She’d gone easy on the wine because of it but she’d been talking so much that she’d hardly touched the food they’d ordered. The one saving grace was that her interviewer had barely eaten either so there was little concern that any mention of Rio’s appetite (or apparent lack thereof) would be mentioned in the piece.</p><p>But it also meant that Rio was <em>hangry</em> and now she was alone with Alice back in their suite she could barely see for the red mist that had descended as they waited on a rushed room service order of burgers and fries.</p><p>“I can’t eat much. I have to look my best and my <em>best</em> is not <em>bloated</em>.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and began plucking at the soft tassels on one of the cushions in her lap, “You look beautiful. Jen is lucky. Stop working yourself up.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, you don’t have a hot date tonight. You can just-…”</p><p>“Geez, thanks, pal!”</p><p>“You know what I meant,” Alice huffed softly, kicking Rio from where she sat just up from her on the couch.</p><p>“You just get to sit here and indulge and think about that Oscar on the horizon. It’s not too early to think about speeches, you know.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and sighed as she leant back in her seat, “A nomination is the win, Alice. Didn’t you say that just two months ago?”</p><p>“Yes, but that was before everyone realised what a contender you are! Screw Agatha! You’re winning. I promise you.”</p><p>But Alice’s optimism didn’t rub off on Rio until she got her greedy hands on the burger that arrived five minutes later.</p><p>She ate without breathing, she devoured without thinking, and then she was done and she could be herself again.</p><p>“That was so impressive. Maybe we should make you do a mukbang.”</p><p>“A what?” Rio asked absently as she began to steal fries from Alice’s half-finished plate.</p><p>“Nevermind. Something to think about.”</p><p>Rio only hummed quietly, intent on her continued thieving activities.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Do you just want my plate?”</p><p>“Yes please,” Rio said quickly, stealing the whole thing over to continue where Alice had left off.</p><p>Alice only rolled her eyes and Rio watched with a mouth full of burger as she disappeared into her room to get changed and shouted over her shoulder, “Rest up tonight, please! One more day of press and then we’re outta here.”</p><p>“Mm’kay,” Rio mumbled as she focused back in on the task at hand.</p><p>By the time Alice was back out Rio was on her back on the couch, clutching her stomach and feeling a little ashamed of herself for eating so much.</p><p>But Alice was twirling in a little black dress and grinning down at her and Rio sat up to admire the view properly.</p><p>“She’ll be putty in your hands.”</p><p>“Here’s hoping,” Alice smiled as she finished her twirl with an uncharacteristic flourish that made Rio laugh.</p><p>“Now,” she said, suddenly turning serious as she marched towards Rio and leant over her with her hands on her shoulders.</p><p>“Don’t wait up, okay? I’m hoping I’ll be back too late for you.”</p><p>“I’m hoping that too,” Rio smiled as she squeezed Alice’s forearms and grinned up at her.</p><p>“Pervert,” Alice accused with a grin as she pulled away and went to fetch her purse.</p><p>“Have a lovely, <em>quiet</em> evening, my friend!”</p><p>Rio flopped back down and waved vaguely in Alice’s direction before the door closed and she was left alone properly for the first time in a day.</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought back to the poolside of their vacation home and smiled to herself as she did.</p><p>But her gentle daydreaming only lasted so long as her mind drifted back to the day she just had and then the day before and then…</p><p>She sat slowly from her prone position and thought about it for only a second before she went to find the little desk in her room.</p><p>Left inexplicably by hotel staff in every corner of the world was a notepad and pen.</p><p>Only this notepad and pen were the fancy kind, the kind that were embossed and had nibs of actual ink.</p><p>Rio snatched the pen up, grateful she’d only had two glasses of wine at lunch so she could think straight as she put pen to paper and wrote out a note to Agatha.</p><p>It took longer than she anticipated and when she was done she had ink on her fingers and a strange nervous buzzing feeling in her stomach.</p><p>But having read it several times after rewriting it even more times, she was happy enough.</p><p>And saying something was better than not saying something.</p><p>And she thought what she’d written was better than nothing:</p><p>
<em>Agatha,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just a note of thanks for getting me and Alice tickets to your premiere.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your performance was astounding. And I’m so grateful that we got to experience it surrounded by that energy. I’ll never forget it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And about the photos with Ralph. I’m so sorry it turned into a shadow on your day. It was nothing, less than nothing, and I hate that it looked like anything at all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You deserved a day that was all about you and I’m sorry that I ruined even a tiny piece of it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you again and enjoy the rest of your time here.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yours,<br/>
Rio.</em>
</p><p>So she folded it neatly, having blown on the ink for fear it wouldn’t dry, and slipped out into the grand hallway of her expensive hotel to sneak down the the Grace Kelly Suite where she knew Agatha to be.</p><p>Before indulging in the expensive but studio-subsidised room service menu, Rio had changed into a navy sweater and jeans, an outfit not intended to be seen by the waiting press of Cannes.</p><p>But Levi’s and The GAP were dressing up as far as Rio was concerned for the task she’d set out to do as she hesitated outside the door.</p><p>She took out the note and read it through once more, taking a deep breath as she folded it back over and bent down to slip it below the door.</p><p>But just as she had pressed half the note underneath, the door swung open and Rio was met with a pair of loafers staring back at her.</p><p>She groaned internally and slowly raised her gaze up the length of the one person she would rather not be seeing from this angle.</p><p>It felt too like a fantasy she’d once had.</p><p>Although Agatha had been wearing significantly fewer clothes and Rio hadn’t been clutching an apology note in her hand.</p><p>“Oh. Hey.”</p><p>She cleared her throat and straightened quickly, fighting off the blush that threatened to redden her whole face as she avoided eye contact.</p><p>“I, uh, just wanted to deliver this note.”</p><p>She dared to look up then, seeing Agatha’s brows raise and an amused smile tug at the sides of her lips.</p><p>“A note? How very old school of you.”</p><p>“I just,” Rio rolled her eyes, more at herself than Agatha and raised a hand to run through her hair, “I wanted to apologise for yesterday. And to thank you for… for getting us into the premiere.”</p><p>Agatha remained silent and Rio saw her purse her lips a little, appraising her for a second before she made a move and snatched the note hanging limply from her fingers.</p><p>“Ah! Hey!”</p><p>But Agatha had moved away before Rio got a chance to snatch it back and her face had gone beetroot red at the idea that Agatha was going to read it infront of her.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t, not yet. Wait until…”</p><p>Rio had taken two steps into the suite behind Agatha who had turned her back and was reading the little note.</p><p>Rio huffed loudly, making sure Agatha knew this was <em>not</em> what she’d had in mind when she’d written the note.</p><p>But she couldn’t do much other than tackle Agatha to steal it back and that wasn’t exactly an option.</p><p>“I… I didn’t think you’d be in, so,” she offered in a lame attempt to claw back some dignity as Agatha turned back around to her and stared at her with a look of soft surprise.</p><p>Rio became aware suddenly that they were both just standing in the middle of the open plan living space that Agatha had previously inhabited with her husband and now lived in alone.</p><p>She swallowed thickly and watched as blue eyes dropped to her throat which did nothing to help her blush.</p><p>“You didn’t need to write me a note,” Agatha said in a voice that took Rio off guard.</p><p>It was soft. Far from the teasing tone she’d expected.</p><p>“I mean,” Rio said with a shrug, feeling her heart rate slow now she knew Agatha at least wouldn’t laugh in her face, “you didn’t need to get us tickets. And… I <em>am</em> sorry about the Ralph thing. It really wasn’t anything and I didn’t want you to think I was trying to make it something.”</p><p>Blue eyes dropped back down to the note in her hands and Rio cleared her throat softly, unsure what to say next.</p><p>“I hope he didn’t leave because of me.”</p><p>Agatha looked back up then and Rio bit her lip where Agatha shook her head and began folding Rio’s note back up absently in her hands.</p><p>“No. He doesn’t really enjoy this anyway so I just told him to go home early. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, aware that Agatha was now slipping her note into her back pocket and she was watching Rio carefully.</p><p>“But Jen said he just touched your hand. Did he…?”</p><p>“No,” Rio clarified quickly, taking a step closer to Agatha without knowing why.</p><p>“He barely touched my hand even. It was just as I was leaving.”</p><p>But Agatha had moved on from the subject of Ralph as her eyes had fallen to Rio’s hands where she’d stepped forwards and she reached suddenly to take up her right hand, looking at the mess Rio had made with the ink earlier.</p><p>“Let me guess… not used to a fountain pen?”</p><p>Rio huffed but fought against the feeling of electricity when the pad of Agatha’s thumb brushed the pad of her forefinger and she felt a little faint as Agatha raised her gaze up to meet her own.</p><p>“It’s not as easy as it looks.”</p><p>“Then I appreciate the effort.”</p><p>Rio smiled in amusement, seeing the twitch in Agatha’s lips as she dropped her hand again.</p><p>“I would have bought you flowers but I assumed you already had too many of those after the premiere.”</p><p>“An excuse if ever I’ve heard one.”</p><p>Rio gaped at Agatha as she turned from her to take up her seat back on the couch and she gestured to the room around her, pointing out the various bouquets of flowers that littered the space.</p><p>She made a mental note to ask Alice why <em>she</em> hadn’t received any flowers.</p><p>“Have you see all of these?!”</p><p>“Another one wouldn’t hurt,” Agatha said with a shrug as she settled back and picked up her wine glass.</p><p>Rio moved closer to the edge of the couch and placed a hand on the back of it, watching Agatha look up at her innocently as she sipped her wine.</p><p>“And here I thought you appreciated my effort.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then motioned to the couch, “Wine?”</p><p>“I…,” Rio’s smile faltered a little as she considered the offer.</p><p>On the one hand all she wanted to do was drink wine and talk to Agatha, on the other, she felt like that may lead to dangerous territory.</p><p>“I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Suit yourself,” Agatha said with a small smile, as if she knew why Rio might be refusing her.</p><p>But Rio felt safer still standing, as if the couch between them were enough to absolve her of her crush.</p><p>They stayed silently looking at the other for a few seconds, Rio plucking at the couch distractedly as she took all that was Agatha Harkness in.</p><p>She looked relaxed and Rio realised that it was the first time she’d seen her in her own space - albeit her own space in a rented suite in a hotel - her hair was wild and verging on messy, her face makeup free, and her clothes much more casual than she’d seen her before.</p><p>It was intoxicating.</p><p>The softness of a woman so untouchable, so out of this world famous.</p><p>“I should go,” Rio said eventually, the silence hanging like a heavy blanket between them both.</p><p>She turned to leave and stopped only when she heard Agatha’s voice behind her, louder than it had been before.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio paused and then turned on the spot, a perfect pirouette for a woman who had spent her childhood on the basketball court rather than in the dance studio.</p><p>“You were mesmerising up there today. Really. I couldn’t keep my eyes off of you.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and felt it settle uncomfortably in her throat, as if her body refused to take it in properly when Agatha’s words had sucked all the oxygen out of the room.</p><p>“Thank you,” she managed to say, unsure what else she <em>could</em> say.</p><p>Agatha just looked across at her, one leg tucked below her, her wine glass held balanced on her knee. Rio’s fingers twitched at her sides and then she turned to leave, favouring what she could have said rather than ruining the compliment with something unworthy of it.</p><p>She stepped from Agatha’s suite as quickly as possibly, practically running back down the hall to get to her own.</p><p>And once inside the safety of her suite, she exhaled the breath she’d been holding, and rested back against the closed door, trying to shake the adrenaline that caused her heart to race in her chest.</p><p>It felt cruel that Agatha had such an impact on her.</p><p>A punishment from a chaotic universe for what, Rio couldn’t fathom.</p><p>She needed to do something to take her mind off of her. Alcohol was out of the question because now she knew she was alone down the hall she didn’t trust herself to not go and knock on the door when she’d had a few, demand to know why she looked at her the way she did, why she had a memory of Agatha pressed so close in a Chicago bar.</p><p>Movies and tv she couldn’t focus on. They were glaring reminders of their shared industry. And therefore glaring reminders of Agatha, whether she were on the screen or not.</p><p>She marched through to her bedroom, deciding a couple melatonin would help to calm her without sending her into outer space.</p><p>It was as she picked up the little tub of pills from the desk that she spotted the remainder of the Hotel-provided paper. And she was suddenly inspired.</p><p>It was cheesy, maybe.</p><p>Stupid, definitely.</p><p>But just doing it didn’t mean she’d give her it.</p><p>And it would be a good distraction from her racing heart and mind for a least a few minutes before she forced herself to sleep.</p><p>She set up her phone against the mirror on the desk and settled herself in the seat, flicking through until she found an easy enough video to follow entitled: ‘Easy Origami Rose’.</p><p>It took a few attempts and therefore longer than a few minutes but eventually Rio was satisfied with her output and in the palm of her hand she now held the flower she should have given Agatha in the first place. Or at least, a small, paper version of one.</p><p>The hotel paper was a pale blue and therefore the rose was too, and Rio thought it was cute and maybe, maybe Agatha would appreciate the effort, just like she had with the note.</p><p>She knew Agatha could laugh in her face when she handed it over but something told her she might not. And that tiny slither of hope was what Rio focused on after popping her melatonin and clambering into bed for a necessary sleep.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, unimpressed by the soft weight of the body lying across her and shouting directly into her ear.</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>Rio huffed out a heavy breath, scowling into the pillow and wriggling a little to dislodge Alice. It didn’t work.</p><p>“Get. Off.”</p><p>“Don’t you want to hear about my date?”</p><p>Rio groaned as Alice eventually rolled off of her and she attempted to pull the duvet over her head, trying to hide from the light.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Rio gave in, knowing she was on a lose lose anyway.</p><p>“Fine. Fine.” She flopped back over and squinted up at Alice who was beaming down at her.</p><p>“You look like shit.”</p><p>“Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“I got in at three,” Alice said with a sly smile that made Rio perk up a little and slowly shuffle into a sitting position at the top of the bed.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“We just talked all night. She invited me back to her room and-…”</p><p>“Alice you dirty dog,” Rio laughed and shoved at her friend’s shoulder roughly.</p><p>“No, no!” Alice laughed with her friend and shoved her right back, “We just talked. Nothing more. Maybe a little kissing but… nothing below the belt.”</p><p>“What about the shirt?”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and began to shuffle from the bed as Rio guffawed and reached to pull her back to her but missed by centimetres.</p><p>“Wait! Wait! Details!”</p><p>“No, I’m a lady. And so is Jen so I will not fuel your dirty little mind with tawdry details.”</p><p>Rio laughed harder at this and eventually threw herself from the bed and onto Alice, kissing her cheek in earnest and forcing a laugh from the smaller woman.</p><p>“I,” kiss, “am,” kiss, “so,” kiss, “happy,” kiss, “for,” kiss, “you.”</p><p>Alice eventually managed to wriggle from Rio’s clutches and made to leave the room laughing when she spotted the little rose garden sprouting on Rio’s desk.</p><p>“What the fuck?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said flatly, seeing where Alice’s gaze had fallen, “yeah, I… got bored.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows and shot Rio a look of surprise, “We need to get you a girlfriend. Better things you can do with those fingers.”</p><p>And before Rio could react, Alice disappeared from the room and closed the door behind her, “I thought you were a lady!”</p><p>“Get ready! You have ten minutes!” Alice shouted right back.</p><p>Rio huffed and shot her late night gardening efforts one last look before she disappeared into the bathroom to shower.</p><p>There was just one more day left of torture before she would be lounging by the pool, free of the pressures of looking and being perfect all the time, free of needing to be anything for anyone.</p><p>All she had to do today was smile and get through.</p><p>And, she decided as she stepped from the shower, she had plenty of time to decide whether or not she’d give her handmade flower to Agatha.</p><p>She’d just take it with her today and if she happened to see her then… maybe she would.</p><p>Once she had changed into something unflattering and that would drive Alice crazy because it wasn’t “good for the gram”, she swiped the best of the flowers and went to sit in her usual seat for the glam squad to work their magic.</p><p>This morning she felt considerably lighter than the previous two mornings.</p><p>The movie had gone down well.</p><p>The press had all gone smoothly.</p><p>Alice was happy with her performance (the slight glitch with Ralph now forgotten).</p><p>And Agatha Harkness thought she was mesmerising.</p><p>As she toyed with the little rose in her now ink-free fingers she could enjoy the glamour of it all again; the soft touches of the people around her drying and fluffing her hair, the brushes against her skin making her look dewy in the morning light, and the woman now touching up her manicure to match the white dress she had for the day.</p><p>Even better, she had a two day vacation to focus on after a short day of more press.</p><p>“Um, Rio?”</p><p>Rio started a little from where she’d been staring out at the blue skies above, her free hand still toying with the matching flower she held.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I…,” Alice stepped into her line of vision and the look on her face made Rio sit up straighter, pulling away from the hands that preened her.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Jen’s just text.”</p><p>Rio glanced down at the phone in Alice’s hands and then her gaze flickered up again and she held her breath as she dropped her rose in her lap and reached for Alice.</p><p>“I might have invited them.”</p><p>Rio’s hand made contact with Alice’s wrist and she stared at her as if she’d just spoken Greek to her.</p><p>“Invited who?”</p><p>“Jen and Agatha.”</p><p>“Invited them where?”</p><p>Alice looked up slowly and met Rio’s gaze for the first time since she’d interrupted the glam squad around them and with a sinking feeling Rio suddenly realised what Alice meant.</p><p>“No. No. Absolutely not.”</p><p>“It’s just that… well Jen said she’s changed their flights.”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“I… don’t even know what to say. I was a little drunk I…”</p><p>But the hairstylist was moving close again to sort Rio’s hair and so Alice was jostled away as the others moved back, mumbling apologies about the time they had left.</p><p>Rio looked away from her friend, unable to comprehend a world where she’d opened up their sneaky little trip away to two people she barely knew.</p><p>Alice knew she needed to give Rio space and she went to take a seat on the couch behind them. And Rio, Rio was now spinning the rose in her palm as if she span it fast enough it might rewind time and stop Alice from inviting her crush to their one precious vacation.</p><p>But time kept moving as it usually does and Rio was faced with changing into her little white dress with a guilt-ridden Alice in the corner of her room, moving close only when Rio needed held with the zipper.</p><p>“It has two rooms,” Rio said sharply, every detail of this trip now spinning round and round in her mind.</p><p>“I’ll be with you, obviously.”</p><p>“They can’t get their own villa?”</p><p>“I… I think Jen wants…”</p><p>“Agatha makes twenty a picture. She can afford-…”</p><p>“Rio, I think… I think she wants to stay with us because…”</p><p>“You’re there,” Rio snapped, feeling only slightly guilty when she saw Alice flinch.</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>She stormed out of the room, almost crushing the rose she’d spent so long perfecting the night before.</p><p>Alice only followed her silently out to the waiting car and if anyone had been paying attention to Rio Vidal and her manager over the past three days they’d have noticed this stark change in behaviour.</p><p>They were usually side by side, or arm in arm, either talking or laughing, or sometimes whispering.</p><p>Never was there a foot between them. Never were they silent.</p><p>But when they got in the car Alice spoke again, and this time Rio listened.</p><p>“I’ll tell her she can’t. I’ll say I was drunk and wasn’t thinking and-…”</p><p>But Rio’s rose-free hand flew over to Alice’s knee and she sighed quietly as Alice went silent.</p><p>“It’s fine. I just… I wanted a couple days just to be us and now…”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I don’t know either of them and, god Alice, Agatha Harkness? Seriously? Why does she have to come?”</p><p>And therein lied the issue. Jen was one thing, a snarky interruption on their vacation. But Agatha? Agatha laid out by the pool. Agatha drunk in the sun. Agatha close by.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure she could handle it. And even if she could, she’d be a mess the whole trip.</p><p>“I think Jen just wants a friend.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and shook her head as Alice went to take her hand, “Are you sure it’s okay?”</p><p>“I… yeah. Fine. You really like her?”</p><p>“I <em>really</em> like her. And now maybe this means she really likes me too?”</p><p>Rio looked up then and caught Alice’s tentative gaze, and couldn’t help but give in to her. She squeezed her hand and offered her a small smile because she couldn’t offer much more as nervous as she was about this new development.</p><p>“I think it means she does.”</p><p>Alice’s shoulders relaxed a bit then, shrinking down from where they’d been hovering near her ears and she shifted a little to get more comfortable in her seat.</p><p>“They’re not on the same flight at least. They get in a little later than us because of the Ceremony later so we can pick the best room and have some dinner and then…”</p><p>“Then figure out how the hell we’ll get through the next couple days.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows and smiled warmly, “Jen is great. And Agatha is apparently great too. Plus it’ll give you an opportunity to get closer to her. She’d be a really good ally to have and-…”</p><p>“I think we’re close enough.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t hurt, Rio. Just… please try and be as charming as you can be.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze to the flower in her hand and began to brush the tips of the petals with her thumb, taking each one in turn.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll be on my best behaviour.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Their reconciliation was cut short when they arrived at another hotel were more press interviews were happening.</p><p>Rio was ushered through the grand lobby and out to a courtyard garden where she was offered orange juice in a champagne flute and asked to wait until they were ready for her.</p><p>At least this way, she got some sun before being locked away for hours on end in a stuffy room with stuffier people asking the same old questions.</p><p>Alice had abandoned her in favour of finding the list of journos soon to be boring her client to death and so Rio hovered by the table draped in white linen and covered in breakfast pastries.</p><p>“Good morning,” came a familiar voice through the greenery, and Rio turned to see Agatha striding towards her looking far more glamorous than she had the night before in a blue and white striped dress and red lipstick.</p><p>“I hear we’re crashing your vacation.”</p><p>“I hear you make twenty a picture and you’re kicking me out of my room to bunk with Jen.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and accepted her orange juice with a smile before turning back to Rio, “Who am I to get in the way of burgeoning romance?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, catching a glimmer of amusement in Agatha’s blue and she felt the urge to one up her, to throw her off course so she turned her hand palm up and held out the rose she’d made her.</p><p>“For you,” she said simply, watching bright blue eyes fly down to the pale paper flower in her hand. And there, Rio caught Agatha suck in a short and sharp intake of breath, her lips parting a little in shock as Rio waited patiently for her to take it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move for a second, her eyes still on the little flower. Rio briefly considered moving for her, forcing her into action, but she held her ground and it soon paid off because Agatha had stepped closer and was now just lightly touching the petals of the rose with her forefinger, the way Rio had earlier in the car.</p><p>“I made it. I thought you’d appreciate the effort.”</p><p>This close up, Agatha was no less beautiful. And with her gaze down on the flower, Rio had the opportunity to take her in properly without fear of being caught.</p><p>She’d been made up today to look like she barely had any makeup on at all. A clever trick, Rio had always thought, because usually that meant you were wearing more makeup than an average person wore in a week.</p><p>But Agatha wore it well. Her skin still looked like skin and Rio could see the faint freckles that were scattered sporadically over her nose and cheeks. She could see the slight sea change of colour in her eyes that made them sometimes bright blue and other times strangely green.</p><p>And those eyes were now looking across at her, taking her in the way Rio had just done with Agatha. Though, Agatha was bolder with it because where Rio had the privacy of Agatha’s gaze being away from her, Rio was looking directly at Agatha as she did it.</p><p>“You made it for me?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>“Along with a few others but… this was my best one.”</p><p>She held her hand up a little higher, holding it so Agatha would take it.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped down to it again and she seemed hesitant at first and then picked it up and held it in her own hand and Rio felt a spark of pride that her creation now sat cradled in Agatha Harkness’s hand like it were something precious.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have.”</p><p>“I wanted to.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze again and they both smiled, Rio losing herself for a moment as she stared across at Agatha and wondered what it might be like to be this close to her all the time.</p><p>But Agatha was moving and Rio was powerless to stop it - not that she would have if she had the choice.</p><p>Agatha’s hand holding the flower had curled around it, moving down to rest on Rio’s hip as she pressed a soft kiss to Rio’s left cheek and then moved around to deliver the same to her right.</p><p>She’d received multiple kisses just like this one since arriving in France but this was the first time she felt aflame because of it.</p><p>And Agatha’s hand still at her hip wasn’t helping.</p><p>“Merci,” Agatha whispered softly, her face still close enough that Rio could make out the green in her blue eyes again, her hand still lightly against her hip.</p><p>But the whispered French had unwittingly brought back memories of Ralph speaking the word to her two days ago, his cloying, clanging American twang turning it into something embarrassing where Agatha had curled her lips around it, softening her accent until it was something else entirely.</p><p>Rio wondered how this goddess was married to that nothing of a man.</p><p>A good husband only because he was handsome and rich and not because he valued his wife’s talent and achievements, or even remained loyal to her.</p><p>And certainly not because he spent time to create a flower for her with his own two hands.</p><p>But she couldn’t think like that. Not with Agatha now coming away with her and Alice.</p><p>She had to distance the part of her that wanted to kiss Agatha from the part of her that wanted to survive the next two days without going mad.</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they both turned to see Alice beaming across at them. Agatha’s hand slipped away from Rio’s hip and Rio felt like she could breathe again.</p><p>“Agatha! Hi! So glad you could make it to Italy!”</p><p>Rio shot her a look over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Rio, they’re ready for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded and in lieu of saying goodbye to Agatha in the way she’d just thanked her she turned around and reached for a croissant, taking it with her as she brushed past Agatha.</p><p>Saying ‘goodbye’ or ‘see you later’ felt too formal so she simply smiled over her shoulder at Agatha and entered back into the main part of the hotel.</p><p>The interviews flew by because Rio wasn’t really thinking about them.</p><p>She was thinking about the way Agatha had looked at her, the way she’d remained close, how she’d held her when there was no need.</p><p>Maybe she was delusional, she didn’t really care, because the idea that Agatha Harkness might find her even slightly appealing, attractive, charming, made her want to whoop in delight.</p><p>When the last journalist left the stuffy little room and Alice and Rio were left alone with the crew Alice finally asked the question she’d been sitting on all day: “Why’re you so happy? What happened?”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and stood from her seat, stretching briefly before she marched on over and like a kid in love, she grinned as she kissed her best friend’s forehead.</p><p>“Just excited for Italy.”</p><p>Alice frowned her suspicions up at her friend but said nothing and instead began to gather their things.</p><p>They both thanked the crew and left to head back to the hotel.</p><p>Rio’s good mood lasted all the way to Italy.</p><p>Even when Alice was going over and over their schedule for when they got back to the states. Even when Alice was worrying out loud about whether or not a weekend away with Jen so early in their tentative relationship would make or break them. Even when they landed and had to travel from Naples to Positano along the high, winding coastal roads of the Amalfi Coast.</p><p>But her good mood paid off because the villa looked even better in real life.</p><p>Situated above on the hillside above the colourful bay, the sand-coloured villa was as impressive on the outside as it was inside.</p><p>The open-plan living kitchen area was spacious and Alice soon discovered that her planning ahead had paid dividends: the wine fridge was stocked and the cupboards, pantry, and fridge were full of fresh local ingredients and snacks.</p><p>But Rio was more interested in the outside space.</p><p>The pool was large and overlooked the hillside with a glass barrier a foot from the edge of the clear blue water, protecting the villa from the cliff edge.</p><p>There was a little dining area to the side and a handful of sun beds dotted around the space.</p><p>But the view.</p><p>The view was unreal.</p><p>Rio lost herself scanning the hillside and looking down over the bay until Alice appeared at her side and gasped quietly.</p><p>“Holy shit. I love that you’re rich now.”</p><p>Rio just laughed and stole Alice back inside, so they could toast to their mutual success that allowed for this kind of villa to be available to them.</p><p>“Okay okay,” Alice said after half a glass of wine on the terrace.</p><p>“But we have to pick a room.”</p><p>“The best one,” Rio said with narrowed eyes at her friend. “You promised we’d get the best one.”</p><p>“Well, seeing as we’re both trying to impress our guests…”</p><p>“Alice, no. Come on. This is <em>our</em> vacation.”</p><p>Alice chewed on her lip and remained silent for a while before she finally said, “Think of how many doors would open if you got Agatha on side.”</p><p>Rio threw her head back, unwilling to share her deep, dark, embarrassing belief that Agatha might just have a little thing for her.</p><p>She was sure she had her as much on side as she ever could.</p><p>“I haven’t had a day off in months.”</p><p>“I know but…”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said suddenly, throwing her hands out, “Whatever. Let them have the best one. I don’t want to fight anymore.”</p><p>They remained silent for a little while and Rio could feel Alice’s eyes on her.</p><p>But she didn’t cave.</p><p>“I think she’s incredible.”</p><p>Rio looked across at Alice and smiled, “I know you do.”</p><p>“And she loves Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded a little and she turned away.</p><p>“So being friends with her will not only help <em>you</em> but it would also help me.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, “We’re friendly, Alice. Don’t try to push anything. We’re… feeling each other out. She’s complex.”</p><p>“But you’re not.”</p><p>Rio grinned and took a sip of wine, “Are you calling me shallow?”</p><p>“More like… straight forward. A little arrogant. Easily amused.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and wondered how Alice would react to her telling her she was in the midst of a near zen-like high because Agatha had accepted a paper flower from her several hours ago and had kissed her cheek.</p><p>“Sure, let’s go with that.”</p><p>It took them finishing the bottle of wine for them to actually head up the stairs with their bags and claim the less incredible of the rooms. Which was hard. Because both were incredible.</p><p>But Alice decided the one with the blue walls just beat the one with the pink because it had a free-standing bath in the en suite.</p><p>“Jen might like that.”</p><p>Rio had just rolled her eyes, annoyed that she had to lug her bags back across the hall to the other room.</p><p>Once their bags were offloaded and Rio made an acceptable but not astounding pasta dish, they retired to the couch where Alice forced Rio to stay until their guests arrived.</p><p>Rio’s earlier high at the prospect of her straight peer potentially having less than straight thoughts about her had disappeared. Perhaps it was the exhaustion creeping in, perhaps it was the wine she’d consumed, or maybe the bowl and a half of pasta puttanesca, but she suddenly didn’t feel so optimistic about Agatha’s arrival.</p><p>But Rio Vidal fell asleep on the couch, curled around a cushion and was woken up around two in the morning by Alice shouting her name and running to the door.</p><p>“They’re here?” She asked groggily, fighting the urge to just roll back over and go to sleep.</p><p>But Jen’s voice carried through the space and Rio groaned quietly as she sat up and dug the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p><p>Maybe the second bottle of wine had been a bad idea.</p><p>“This place is gorgeous!”</p><p>Rio groaned again and forced herself to stand up, running her hand through her hair at the last minute to try to fix what was already broken.</p><p>“God it’s-… Jesus, Rio. Make an effort, much?”</p><p>Rio blinked at the sudden insult and glanced down at herself before she moved around the couch towards the waiting women.</p><p>Two smiling at her, one with an amused smirk.</p><p>“A pleasure to have you here with us on <em>our</em> vacation, Jen.”</p><p>Alice jabbed Rio’s side and Rio only just managed to squirm away. She felt Agatha’s eyes on her as she did so.</p><p>“Alice invited us,” Jen said with a grin that had softened somewhat and Rio glanced at Alice to see her looking suddenly shy.</p><p>“Well we’re pleased to have you.”</p><p>“And here I thought you were a <em>good</em> actress,” Jen said with a smirk just as Rio’s gaze moved to Agatha as she strode towards the bifold glass doors to take in the view outside.</p><p>“Very funny.”</p><p>“Now, Agatha here just won the <em>Palme D’Or</em>.”</p><p>Rio was still looking at Agatha and watched as she turned from where she stood by the glass doors to look at them with raised brows, her gaze lingering on Rio for a second, “The film won. Not me.”</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>“Oscar’s ours, baby,” Jen said in a softer tone and Rio didn’t have to look around to know that she was now talking only to Alice.</p><p>Rio scoffed softly but decided she was too tired to either charm or scorn so she disappeared to get a glass of water.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice shouted after her, “Could you get some wine?”</p><p>Rio could only hum a response and grabbed two more glasses and a fresh bottle before she turned back towards the living area of the space and poured three glasses, avoiding her own.</p><p>“You’re not staying?”</p><p>“I would but I’m exhausted.”</p><p>“Refusing to drink wine with me two nights in a row, Vidal? I’ll start to get offended.”</p><p>Tried brown eyes flickered across to teasing blue ones and Rio bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“Third time’s the charm. Perhaps you’ll get lucky tomorrow.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be a thing.”</p><p>Agatha moved forwards to pick up her glass and they maintained eye contact, Rio feeling a little stupefied by the obvious flirting and only Alice rocked her from her trance.</p><p>“We’ll go to the beach tomorrow.”</p><p>But as Rio looked up at her friend she saw that she was already back engrossed in Jen, her face lit up with the prospect of two days (practically) alone with her.</p><p>On the couch, Agatha was watching Rio, and it took Rio a second to notice but when she looked back down, Agatha had looked away.</p><p>She hesitated for just a second before she turned on her heel and trod the path up to her designated bed for the night.</p>

<p>Rio woke to a pillow to her face and yelped as she sat bolt upright, cradling the offending weapon to her.</p><p>“Alice!”</p><p>“Get up! We only have two days here. I want to make the most of it. And you need to tell me what to wear to look <em>irresistible</em>”

</p><p>Rio huffed and rolled over, “I pay your wages, you know.”</p><p>“Yes, I know. Pay me more, bitch.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Alice jumped onto the bed behind her and began to shake her shoulders playfully, attempting to annoy her out of bed. </p><p>“Get off! Get off!”</p><p>Rio shuffled away and flopped onto her back, scowling at a grinning Alice. </p><p>“You’re too giddy. I don’t like this Alice. What happened to my brooding, charmingly grumpy friend?”</p><p>“She’s in looooove,” Alice sang out and laughed as she threw herself from the bed and went to fetch her outfit options for the day. </p><p>“Alice,” Rio said steadily, sitting slowly to look at across at her with what she hoped was a stern expression but the twitch to the right of her lips gave her away a little.</p><p>“Don’t go all goo-goo ga-ga on me. I can’t handle it.”

</p><p>“Shut up. Just help me pick.”</p><p>“I can’t believe this is what my vacation has turned into.”</p><p>Alice looked guilty suddenly and her smile faded from her face, “I know. I’m sorry. You know I didn’t-…”

</p><p>“It’s fine.” </p><p>Rio sighed heavily and ungracefully hauled herself from the bed, yawning as she arrived at Alice’s side and surveyed the options laid out before her. </p><p>“Well, I mean…” she held up a teeny tiny bikini top and held it against her own chest, “Who could resist?”</p><p>“Stop that,” Alice laughed and grabbed it back, “I’d wear a shirt over it.”</p><p>“No way.” Rio reached to take it back and grinned down at it, “This’ll give her a heart attack.”</p><p>“I don’t want a heart attack. I want at least some above the bikini action before we have to head back to our real lives.”</p><p>“Alice, this will get you more than that. I promise you.”</p><p>Alice huffed but Rio could see the smirk threatening her best friend’s features, “red one it is.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio announced as she made her way to the adjoining bathroom, yawning again and stretching her arms up in the air to release any tension from the previous night. “I’ll be down in ten. Don’t leave without me.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at the sarcastic drawl of her giddy friend and disappeared to shower. </p><p>Beneath the heavy waterfall, Rio took slow and steady breaths, taking the time to convince her mind and body that today would be easy. She needed to believe it because she’d not felt this nervous around another human being since middle school.</p><p>Agatha’s presence was a constant pull towards the version of Rio that was incredibly uncool and incredibly downbad for the cheerleader who once smiled at her in the hallway but otherwise barely acknowledged her presence. </p><p>But she had to get through it, had to find a way to be friendly, for the sake of her career, and for the sake of Alice’s burgeoning relationship with Jen. </p><p>So she got out, dried herself, and slipped into a black bikini, denim short shorts, and a Hawaiian overshirt that Alice hated but that Rio loved. </p><p>She barely glanced in the mirror, knowing makeup would be the wrong choice for a day by the beach and her hair would dry naturally anyway. </p><p>Plus she had no one to impress. </p><p>Technically.</p><p>Rio was the last one down to the little group and smiled at the expectant faces of the three people waiting for her. </p><p>“Lookin’ good, Vidal,” Alice shot at her with a wink, “but you’d look better if you took that shirt off.”</p><p>Rio laughed and muttered, “Heard that one before.” 

</p><p>“Is that… cowboys?” Jen asked with a frown, tilting her head to get a proper look at the print of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“You’re darn right it is.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Alice groaned out, “don’t get her started.”</p><p>“What? I’m kidding! That isn’t very rootin’ tootin’ of you, Alice.”</p><p>A soft noise behind her made Rio turn and she caught Agatha’s eye, seeing her smile a little in amusement at her, her gaze dropping briefly to the cowboys flying their lassos over Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this but said nothing, ignoring the lurch in her stomach as it happened.</p><p>But Alice was desperate to get them to the beach, desperate to show off for Jen, and Rio didn’t protest as she made a fuss about all grabbing their stuff to leave.</p><p>Rio complained only when Alice refused to let her make a coffee first but as they stepped into the sun, she found Agatha pressing a mug into her hand, “Here. Just made it. Already had one.”</p><p>Unsure whether this was just a kind gesture or a dig at Rio being the last up, Rio accepted it all the same, and happily drank Agatha’s coffee all the way down to the beach.</p><p>Alice had done her research and had picked the smaller of the beaches in the area, Fornillo Spiaggia, so that they’d hopefully be less bothered by tourists and fans.</p><p>Rio had brought with her a trusty, dusty blue cap to be as incognito as possible and she noticed that Agatha had been thinking along the same lines but had a woven hat with a floppy wide brim instead.</p><p>Rio was a little luckier, she supposed, she could potentially be mistaken for any old Italian beachgoer, but Agatha was clearly a movie star.</p><p>On the way down to the sand, Alice broached the subject of shared photos and Agatha politely but firmly declined, offering no reasoning behind her refusal but allowing her “no” to speak for itself.</p><p>Rio ought to have been offended by this but she couldn’t find it in herself to care much. Neither Agatha nor Jen were supposed to be on this vacation anyway, so what did she care if there was photographic evidence they were. “Looks good for the brand,” Alice muttered in annoyance to her as they set themselves up.</p><p>Jen insisted that Agatha be on the inside of the little group of four, for fear she’d be spotted too easily if on the outside.</p><p>This, Agatha protested too, but her “no” this time was ignored.</p><p>And although Rio was disgruntled that Agatha would be beside her all day, she couldn’t help but be amused by the sight of Agatha not getting her own way with Jen. Their relationship felt a lot like hers and Alice’s. Which meant that Agatha Harkness might just be human after all.</p><p>Pretending to not notice the quiet discussion beside her as it was ongoing, Rio unfurled her towel and stripped down to her bikini, throwing her shorts and shirt over the end of her bed.</p><p>She fished out the sun lotion from her bag and was just about to apply some to her legs when she heard a voice beside her ask: “Can I have that after you?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, now sitting on her own sunbed with her hat still on her head and an expectant look on her face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said slowly, doing her best not to look at the expanse of pale skin on offer to her with Agatha in a mauve bikini. “It’s just…” but there was no use, she had to look, but only because it was relevant to the conversation.</p><p>She glanced down and spotted a smattering of freckles across Agatha’s chest, unwilling to look any further, she looked back up. “You’ll burn.”</p><p>“That’s why I want the lotion,” Agatha said, raising her brows and straightening her back a little, which only made it harder for Rio to maintain eye contact.</p><p>“No, I mean, I’ve SPF 15. You’ll surely need stronger.”</p><p>A look of incredulity flashed across Agatha’s face and she laughed a little, “So you won’t share it which will mean I’ll burn anyway?”</p><p>“That isn’t what I meant. I just meant…” she looked around and saw Alice applying lotion to Jen’s back and had to fight the grin from her face, knowing how thrilled Alice would be about this honour.</p><p>“Maybe ask Jen and Alice.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned to do just that but quickly turned back around to Rio and shook her head, holding her hand out to her, “They’re busy. Gimme.”</p><p>Rio huffed and handed the lotion across, and only in doing so did she realise she was yet to put any on herself.</p><p>She threw herself back down on the bed and waited impatiently for Agatha to be done, refusing to look around at what was surely to be an incredible sight of Agatha rubbing lotion all over her body.</p><p><em>Pervert</em>, she thought idly to herself.</p><p>A light tap on her shoulder a few minutes later told her that Agatha was done with her sun cream and Rio lifted to her elbows to take it from her, frowning a little as she did.</p><p>She lifted her glasses and a slow smile spread over her face as Agatha looked at her quizzically, “What is it?”</p><p>“You’ve got a little…” Rio motioned near her own nose and smiled wider when Agatha missed it entirely and somehow rubbed more cream across the bridge of her nose.</p><p>“Here,” Rio offered as she swung her legs over the side of the bed and reached to gently wipe the lotion from Agatha’s nose. She realised only when she pulled her hand away that she’d been holding her breath as she did this, and she flushed slightly at the realisation.</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered quietly, her own cheeks slightly flushed and her eyes darting about Rio’s face.</p><p>They watched each other for a second and Rio felt the familiar butterflies in her stomach as she met Agatha’s gaze but she soon turned away and busied herself with the bottle so she didn’t have to look at Agatha again.</p><p>By the time she was done, she lay back out and sighed as she stretched an arm above her on the sun bed, allowing the heat of the day to soothe her of the knowledge that right beside her was Agatha Harkness, lying in a similar position, in a bikini that Rio had decided she couldn’t look at again for fear she’d combust.</p><p>“Rio,” the voice came close to her ear and Rio frowned a little, her whole body hot and uncomfortable in the midday sun, but Alice was persistent, and shook Rio’s shoulder, “you’ll want to wake up for this. Jet skis. Come on.”</p><p>Rio blinked her way awake, frowning into the brightness even with her sunglasses and cap on.</p><p>She first noticed Alice crouched beside her and then spotted Jen and Agatha a little way down the beach by the shed where the water sports equipment could be rented.</p><p>“How long was I asleep?”</p><p>“Do me a solid,” Alice said urgently, “share one with Agatha. I want to share with Jen and if you-…”</p><p>“No. Alice. No. That would be <em>insane</em>.”</p><p>Alice whined a little and took Rio’s hand when she sat up properly and swung her legs over the edge.</p><p>“Just ask Jen if she’d share.”</p><p>“No I don’t want to seem too keen.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio laughed, “Like inviting her on vacation? And me asking Agatha to share isn’t going to look too keen?”</p><p>“You’re friends, sorta, there’s nothing romantic there, it’s different.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and turned around to look over at the two by the shed, seeing Jen wave them over. Agatha was at least wearing a large linen shirt now, her long hair loose now she didn’t have her hat on and the large sunglasses covering her blue eyes.</p><p>Maybe she could do it.</p><p>Maybe she could just ignore the closeness and focus on the driving.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said stiffly, turning back to Alice, “Don’t ask me for anything else this trip, okay?”</p><p>Alice beamed up at her from where she was resting against the back of her ankles and kissed the back of Rio’s hand. “Yes. Thank you. I owe you one.”</p><p>“You owe me more than one.”</p><p>Rio grabbed her shirt with the cowboys, shoving it on unhappily as they marched their way over to Agatha and Jen.</p><p>Alice nudged Rio’s arm as they got close and Rio rolled her eyes but glanced Agatha’s way and swallowing her pride she said: “Want to ride with me? More fun when there’s two.”</p><p>She couldn’t see her eyes beneath her large shades but Agatha’s brows rose up and she looked startled for a second before she said: “That so? Fine. I’ve never been on one before anyway so you can show me how it’s done, cowboy.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t expected the nickname. She hadn’t expected to be so affected by it either.</p><p>She poked her tongue into the inside of her cheek and heard a sudden ringing in her ears. How Agatha was able to do this to her she had no idea. But she stepped forwards anyway and approached the Italian man waiting for who was going to rent what.</p><p>She explained they’d be taking two and he only nodded, pointing briefly to a safety notice on the side that had stick men exhibiting some strange behaviours at sea: drinking from a wine bottle, riding backwards, and waving his arms in the air.</p><p>Rio studied this for a second and once sure she wouldn’t be doing any of those things she nodded her assent.</p><p>“No glasses,” he said suddenly and Rio thought it was weird they couldn’t wear their sunglasses but at no point had he said anything about them all being half dressed.</p><p>She raised a brow but nodded and passed him her glasses, turning to the others to make sure they did the same.</p><p>Jen was the only one who had a problem with this and huffed as she removed her Chanels and handed them over.</p><p>But it was when he turned to Agatha that Rio suddenly had the problem.</p><p>She stood between them so watched almost in slow motion as the man lecherously looked her up and down, his greedy eyes taking in every inch of skin on offer to him and his tongue coming out to wet his lips.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and though the man didn’t notice or look up she saw that Agatha did.</p><p>She turned away quickly and tried to ignore the strange feeling of anger that had bubbled in her chest. Surely it was just that a man was ogling a woman. Nothing more.</p><p>But soon she was being handed a thin life jacket, bundled in a u-shape that hung upside down over her neck.</p><p>It didn’t look very effective but Rio was confident enough that she wouldn’t be the cause of either herself or Agatha Harkness dying today.</p><p>They followed the man down to the shore and waded in a few steps and watched a very brief and not very detailed instruction as to how to start and stop the skis.</p><p>Rio was losing patience with this man, but tried not to let it show even as her jaw flexed and when he was done with his demonstration she walked right past him and threw her leg over the seat, situating herself as she waited for Agatha.</p><p>“Not a fan?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio was checking the turn key operation and adjusting herself in the seat to make sure she was comfortable, not looking at Agatha who now stood beside her, watching curiously.</p><p>“You look furious, honey.”</p><p>Rio froze briefly and turned to look at Agatha, momentarily taken aback by the sight of her standing in water up to her knees, wearing the life jacket around her neck.</p><p>It was infuriating that she looked good in it.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” she huffed quietly, turning back to the ski to make sure she knew where everything was before they went out on the open water.</p><p>She felt Agatha clamber on behind her, and was grateful that she wasn’t pressed close.</p><p>“You ready?” She asked after thirty more seconds, only slightly more cautious of just heading off than Alice was who had just skated off beside them.</p><p>“When you are,” Agatha responded, and Rio raised her brows when she found her elbows suddenly being held.</p><p>She glanced down to her right and then looked over her shoulder at Agatha curiously, “You’ll have to hold on properly.” She reached her left hand back and found the small fabric handle just behind her, “Here.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha glanced at it, and then looked back up, “That? That doesn’t look…” but then something happened and Agatha seemed to change her mind and she straightened her back a little, tossing her hair behind her back as she reached for the little handle with both hands.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned back around, and in a quick one-two motion, they were off.</p><p>Rio made for where Alice had gone to and when they were out as far as the deepest swimmers she kicked the throttle in properly and the little jet ski flew over the waves.</p><p>Rio laughed with her adrenaline rush and whooped until she heard a voice over the din of the engine and the rush of the wind.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly when she heard it, and without hesitation she slowed the beast of a machine down, turning inwards so they were facing back into the shore and maintaining a steady hand until she cut the engine and they bobbed slowly with the waves.</p><p>“You okay?” She turned and saw that Agatha looked white, her eyes wide.</p><p>“Shit. Sorry. I-…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio turned as best she could and reached for Agatha’s arm, squeezing it gently, “I’ll slow down.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio felt the sting of rejection as she brushed Rio’s hand from her arm, “No I’m fine. I just didn’t know they could go that fast.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and chewed on a lip for a second before she asked: “Would you feel better if you held onto me?”</p><p>Agatha opened and closed her mouth a couple times and then looked down between them at the flimsy handle she had in a death grip, glancing between that and Rio’s shirt.</p><p>She didn’t say anything but she shifted slowly forwards and as soon as she did, Rio realised what a mistake this offer was.</p><p>Agatha was now pressed against her, their bodies totally flush bar the life vest draped around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Rio felt on fire suddenly, the flames spreading over her in a second, and worsened by the arms that snaked around her waist, and the soft shock of a hand slipping below her shirt to rest against her exposed ribcage.</p><p>When Agatha spoke again she spoke close to Rio’s ear and she had to fight the shiver that threatened her entire body at the feel of her breath so close.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Rio wondered why Agatha hadn’t moved her hand when she’d realised it was inside her open shirt but she didn’t, couldn’t, draw attention to it for fear of being caught out.</p><p>So she focused back on the task at hand, and forgot about the woman wrapped so snugly around her.</p><p>The only issue was, when Rio built their speed back up, Agatha held her only tighter, and with so little fabric between them Rio could feel every flex of her muscles, very twitch of her fingers, and every frightened breath against her neck.</p><p>If Rio had felt like she was flying before, it was nothing to now.</p><p>Agatha holding her was the best and worst thing in the world.</p><p>She’d felt safe enough to go fast again only because Agatha hadn’t exclaimed or screamed or told her to stop. And the faster she went, the more Agatha kept close.</p><p>If she stopped Agatha would pull away. She’d drop her hold and Rio would never feel this way again.</p><p>But Alice and Jen were in the distance and they were waving to them to come over.</p><p>They were heading further out to sea now and Rio had to slow down for fear she’d send them both toppling into the deep.</p><p>And if Agatha were scared now, she could only imagine how scared she’d be in the open water.</p><p>So she slowed to a reasonable pace which meant she’d have no problem pulling up beside Alice’s ski and with it she felt Agatha’s hold loosen but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Just as they arrived parallel to the other two in their party Rio felt Agatha squeeze over her ribs gently, and then her thumb brush over her skin and Rio almost rocketed them off in the wrong direction by accident.</p><p>She could feel every inch of her body like her sensitivity had been dialled up to a hundred.</p><p>Every inch of it that Agatha touched was still on fire and Rio idly wondered if she’d ever feel the same again.</p><p>Maintaining a steady path towards Alice, she briefly glanced over her left shoulder at Agatha and regretted it immediately where their faces were too close and she had to turn sharply to avoid the pull of hypnotic blue eyes.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her soon fell as they reached the others but she didn’t move back and as Rio pulled up and turned off the engine, Agatha dropped her hands to just before Rio’s thighs, resting her fingertips on the seat.</p><p>They were so close that Rio could feel the warmth of her palms against her inner thighs and she had to fight with herself as she gently lifted Agatha’s hands from this position and placed them on her hips, which felt safer but still not out of the danger zone.</p><p>“I hate this,” Jen said with a frown, her arms still wrapped tightly around a very pleased looking Alice.</p><p>“Are there sharks in the Med?”</p><p>“Oh plenty,” Agatha said with a laugh, “All very keen on publicists.”</p><p>Rio snorted and felt the unmistakeable squeeze of her hip. She glanced back at Agatha and saw she was smiling at her, looking almost as pleased as Alice.</p><p>“What’s this?” Jen asked suddenly, indicating Rio and Agatha who were smiling at each other still, only turning back when she added, “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Can’t stay for long and chat, I’m afraid,” Agatha said suddenly, squeezing both of Rio’s hips and then wrapping her arms back around her. If Rio needed any other indication that Agatha wanted her to drive again, it was that both hands were now beneath her shirt and life vest, holding her bare waist, and Rio would have driven across oceans if it meant she could continue having her hold her there. “We’ll catch you back at the beds.”</p><p>With that, Rio kicked the engine into gear with another one-two, and without giving any warning, they shot off, running parallel to the current and moving down with it until Rio found and calm to hit the gas and jump up the speed.</p><p>In their wake both Jen and Alice watched in shock until Alice shrugged and said, “Rio likes to show off.”</p><p>And Rio did.</p><p>Rio heard the sound of Agatha laughing against her ear and turned a little into it, keeping her eyes on the open sea. “It’s like flying!”</p><p>And Rio began to laugh too, because maybe Agatha felt even a fraction of how she felt then, maybe she could understand just a small bit how her body was reacting to her.</p><p>Or maybe not, and that was fine too, because she could have listened to just her laughing for centuries.</p><p>But Rio had a pretty girl wrapped around her which meant that no ordinary amount of showing off would do.</p><p>She had to push it.</p><p>And so, without warning, she swung them around, and Agatha yelled out in surprise, her arms constricting impossibly so Rio felt like she couldn’t breath but then they were speeding off in the other direction again and Agatha relented.</p><p>Rio took deep gasps of air and guessed that Agatha knew what she’d done because she was rubbing her thumbs gently across her ribs, soothing Rio’s burning lungs as best she could.</p><p>But her soft touches were much worse than getting no oxygen to her lungs.</p><p>Rio felt high with it, and was vaguely concerned she could be caught for driving under the influence: Agatha’s influence.</p><p>When Rio slowed again, unsure how much the little ski could take with two bodies on it and going at max speed for the majority of their run, Agatha’s arms loosened and uncrossed over her body.</p><p>She felt them taking the unnecessary journey of pulling back over her ribs to rest at her sides so her shirt was pulled back below her armpits and her front was totally exposed to the open sea.</p><p>She held her there for longer than she needed to and Rio had to tell herself Agatha was just taking a moment to recover because it felt like she was just enjoying holding her.</p><p>Which wasn’t something a happily married woman would do.</p><p>“That was crazy,” Agatha breathed softly, slowly dropping her hold on Rio to rest her hands down against her hips.</p><p>Rio glanced back at her and had to fight the urge to push her hands away completely, feeling as hot as she did under her touches.</p><p>But Agatha seemed to sense this and pulled her hands away, placing a few inches between them on the seat.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and glanced back again at her, briefly catching sight of blue eyes staring back at her, “You think Jennifer’s in love?”</p><p>“Without a doubt. Jen’s been obsessed since she first saw her.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. Love at first sight.”</p><p>Rio laughed and ran a hand through her hair, shaking it out loosely where it was was damp from the salt spray, “I didn’t take you for the romantic type.”</p><p>“No? What gave me away?”</p><p>Rio hummed and rested her forearms on the handlebars, staring out at the sea before them, “Your general demeanour and you know… ice queen reputation.”</p><p>She felt a sudden, light jab to her side and squealed a little as she batted a hand that had already retreated. “Hey! I’m sensitive.”</p><p>Agatha snorted behind her and Rio glanced back to see that Agatha had turned her attention to the open body of water too and she looked distant for a second before she asked, “Are you seeing anyone?”</p><p>Despite the innocence of the question it hung heavy in the salt air between them and Rio didn’t know why. She wanted to puff her chest and proclaim that she saw a new girl every night but Agatha wasn’t the right audience for that.</p><p>Though she wanted her to know she was desirable.</p><p>Wanted her to know that if she’d felt like this about any other actress she’d probably have found a way to make it happen for her.</p><p>To get over her crush by getting <em>under</em> her crush. Or on top of her. Whichever way was quickest.</p><p>But she shook those feelings off and instead shrugged a little, deciding honesty was the best policy.</p><p>“No. I haven’t had a girlfriend for a couple years now.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>
<em>My inability to commit, my fear of rejection.</em>
</p><p>She couldn’t give those answers either.</p><p>So Rio shrugged and dropped her gaze to the gentle waves beneath them, choosing another truth instead: “Work takes me all over the place. There aren’t many people who’d put up with so much distance all the time.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio looked over her shoulder at her, feeling the weight of things unsaid but not knowing what they were.</p><p>“And Ralph? How’s he with it all?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said noncommittally, shrugging her shoulders and looking down at her hands, “He’s fine.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and decided to probe a little more. Seemed like both of them were only telling half truths.</p><p>“Was it love at first sight?” Agatha’s eyes snapped up to her own, “With Ralph?”</p><p>Then her gaze dropped again and she shook out her hair, making a vague gesture back to the shoreline, “We should probably head back.”</p><p>The change had been so sudden that if Rio had blinked she’d have missed it.</p><p>Agatha was looking more than distant now.</p><p>She looked on another planet.</p><p>And the strange, tentative rapport they’d built up since that first photoshoot, then had cemented in Cannes, suddenly meant nothing as Agatha built a wall between them so solid that Rio didn’t think she’d ever break through.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio hesitated before starting the engine and fully expected Agatha to move back in again but she didn’t.</p><p>A soft movement behind her told her that Agatha had instead chosen to take the flimsy handle again and she couldn’t help but wonder if it were punishment for asking about her husband.</p><p>Perhaps it was a reminder of the hand holding incident that had almost derailed their Cannes experience.</p><p>Perhaps it was something else.</p><p>Rio piloted them back to where they’d picked the jet ski up in the first place and kept the pace slow, not wanting to frighten Agatha for one and worried about what her reception would be when they got back onto dry land.</p><p>Once the engine was off, Agatha slipped from the jet ski without looking back and Rio found herself watching her as she handed her life vest back, took her sunglasses, and walked back up the beach to their loungers.</p><p>Alice and Jen were there already so she wouldn’t have a chance to bring up Agatha’s change in mood - not that she really wanted to.</p><p>She handed the keys back to the man and delivered the life vest into the little box, taking her sunglasses too, before heading back up.</p><p>Only, unlike Agatha, she was stopped.</p><p>It was a bunch of teenage Italian boys, no younger than seventeen, no older then about twenty one.</p><p>They crowded round Rio and started speaking in excitable, rapid Italian.</p><p>Rio picked up some of it: “Beautiful Rio!” “The actress, no?” But the rest was such a blurring of voices that even Rio’s Spanish couldn’t help her decipher it.</p><p>So she smiled and nodded and made to squeeze past them but one grabbed her around the waist and her body’s reaction could not have been more different to the reaction to Agatha grabbing her there earlier.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio shouted, shoving the boy’s arm away from herself and wrestling past him, she stumbled and fell into another body and made to shove it away before she realised who it was.</p><p>Agatha had run back down the beach to pull her away and Alice was right behind her, yelling at them in Spanish, hoping they’d understand that and if not, she added a few violent “fuck offs” that were surely universal.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said huffily, even though Agatha hadn’t asked and was instead walking silently back to the sun beds with her, one hand holding her arm, the other wrapped around her as if someone would jump Rio any second.</p><p>“They’re just horny teenagers.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but didn’t say anything still and Rio actually blushed when she pulled her down onto her sun lounger with her, crowding her so she sat closer to the top, and Rio leant back at an angle to rest her back against the sturdy wooden parasol that sat between Agatha and Jen’s beds.</p><p>“Where did he touch you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced up at Agatha, briefly distracted from where she’d been watching Alice march furiously back up the beach towards them.</p><p>“What? Nowhere.”</p><p>“I saw him <em>grab</em> you,” Agatha insisted and Rio sighed quietly, her eyes still on Alice as she got closer.</p><p>“Just around my waist.”</p><p>Rio missed Agatha’s furious look because she was reaching for Alice and pulling her towards her, shuffling forwards to get closer to her. “You okay?”</p><p>“Fine. Idiots. I’ve told you we should get you a-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said sternly, scowling up at her best friend, “Do you know how embarrassing that would be?”</p><p>Alice huffed, “Less embarrassing than being tossed about by some prepubescent boys.”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em> tossed about,” Rio began to insist but she felt a hand on her knee that made her stop she saw Agatha shifting closer. Over her shoulder Jen was now hovering.</p><p>She glanced around at Agatha and saw that she looked more tense than even Alice and frowned at this reaction, unsure why it had bothered her so much. For someone who had practically gone silent on her ten minutes ago, she seemed to be caring pretty deeply about some idiots trying to get a reaction out of Rio.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice tried again but softer this time, “don’t move. I’ll go and get us all some drinks. Just… stay as incognito as possible.”</p><p>Rio huffed and reached for her earlier-discarded cap, and shoved it on her head unhappily.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had been dislodged where Rio had moved and Jen stepped around them to follow Alice.</p><p>Rio made to move to her own sun bed but was pulled back down by Agatha who was watching her sternly, “Just stay there.”</p><p>“Oh come on. They’re hardly the mafia. They’re stupid kids trying to impress their friends. I’m fine.”</p><p>“It’s assault.”</p><p>“Don’t be so dramatic.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze and scowled across at her, wondering why the universe made her friends with Jen, and then why the universe made Alice friends with her, and why on god’s green earth it decided those two should fall in love and force her and Agatha together.</p><p>It seemed too cruel.</p><p>“Just wait until everyone’s back.”</p><p>“And what? You’ll protect me in the meantime?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she turned from Rio, “Fine. Whatever.”</p><p>Rio made a show of stepping onto her old sun bed and lifted her knees up to the sky, which she stared furiously at beneath her sunglasses.</p><p>They didn’t speak until Alice and Jen returned.</p><p>Alice seemed to have calmed down but she picked up on the tension immediately and perched beside Rio’s hip on the bed, passing her a spritz. “What’s happened?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio muttered at the same time as Agatha, both shooting the other a look.</p><p>“Jesus,” Jen sighed as she sat beside Agatha on the bed, “and people call me <em>dramatic</em>.”</p><p>“Listen,” Alice said, raising her free hand in the air, “when one of you eventually wins the Oscar-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen interjected quickly.</p><p>“It’s important you still both smile for the cameras. Which <em>means</em>,” she continued insistently as Rio began to protest, “That whatever this is, whatever the two of you are annoyed about needs to be fixed. Now please, Rio.”</p><p>“Why do you assume it’s my fault?”</p><p>Agatha and Jen both scoffed and Rio scowled as she sat up properly, narrowing her eyes at Agatha in particular, “she was being patronising.”</p><p>“You were assaulted. I was trying to-…”</p><p>“I wasn’t. It was kids.”</p><p>“Kids who grabbed you and-…”</p><p>“You touched me more on that jet ski than that boy did.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened to retort and then closed just as quickly again and Rio heard the words reverberate in her own mind and she realised how they must have sounded, what she was accusing Agatha of.</p><p>“Not,” she started, unsure how to escape this hole. “I-,” but Agatha was looking so mortified that she suddenly looked furious, her whole face morphing before Rio’s eyes as Rio finished quietly, “I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>Jen moved her hand to Agatha’s arm and shook her a little but her gaze was firm even when her words were not, and her eyes were on Rio. It felt like she were being warned. “Hey. Relax. She didn’t mean it. It’s been a stressful few minutes. Drink your drink.”</p><p>Rio watched in horror as Agatha turned away from her, her jaw tighter than she’d ever seen it and she felt Alice touch her leg and draw her attention to her as she murmured, “Apologise. Now.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and handed her drink to Alice, standing slowly and going to stand at the end of Agatha’s bed, standing right in front of her so that Agatha had to turn her face away to avoid looking at her.</p><p>She felt small suddenly, strangely desperate to rewind time, take them back to their time on the ski where nothing else mattered but Agatha’s hands on her.</p><p>Rio glanced briefly at Jen who nodded once and took that as an ‘okay’ to go on.</p><p>She crouched down and placed a hand on the very edge of the bed, not daring to move any closer. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and slowly turned her gaze to Rio and miraculously, surprisingly, she’d softened. Her blue eyes were no longer steely and her jaw wasn’t as firm and more than anything she looked a little hurt.</p><p>Jen behind her made a move to go back to her bed but shot Rio a scowl and Alice placed Rio’s drink down before she disappeared to her own leaving Agatha and Rio in as private a little bubble as they could get on a public beach.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said softly, “I didn’t mean that you-… I heard it after I said it. I was trying to say-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha reassured quietly.</p><p>And Rio nodded, her gaze dropping to Agatha’s hand where it sat on her knee. She didn’t reach for it, but she lifted her forefinger and touched her knuckle gently before she stood back up, picked up her drink and returned to her bed.</p><p>Perhaps a semi-peace with Agatha was all she could hope for.</p><p>A tentative friendship with the most famous woman in the world whom Rio just happened to want to kiss every second of the day.</p><p>It’d be fine.</p><p>Rio adjusted her sun lounger so she could sit up a bit more and took the opportunity to gaze out to sea.</p><p>Despite being grabbed in the same place Agatha had held her so tightly she could still feel Agatha’s hold on her, far stronger than the memory of the Italian youth.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly and allowed herself to fantasise just for a second.</p><p>She thought of the woman next to her whispering a soft “fuck it” and sliding across to sit behind her on the lounger. She imagined her soft hands roaming her torso, touching her where she wanted to even on this crowded beach. And then they were on the jet ski again and Agatha’s hold was firm and her hand was sliding down her abdomen and dipping slowly beneath her thin bikini to touch the place that Rio most desperately wanted her.</p><p>But before she lost herself too much, before she tortured herself with these thoughts whilst the woman of her fantasises lay out next to her, she opened her eyes and took a long sip of her drink.</p><p>The cool bitterness was like a palate cleanser for her mind and she tried to focus on people watching rather than slipping back into her desperate desire for Agatha to hold her again.</p><p>But she couldn’t ride around a jet ski forever hoping that one day Agatha would jump back on.</p><p>She just had to power through the next couple of days and then seeing Agatha wouldn’t be so intense again. She’d have time and distance between them and she wouldn’t have to be this het up all the time.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness!”</p><p>Rio blinked into the sun and adjusted her cap slightly as she looked up at whoever was destroying their peace. From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha sit up slowly, and just behind her, on the furthest sunbed, she saw Alice her protective best friend sit up straight.</p><p>“I am such a big fan!”</p><p>Rio watched with interest as the woman before them beamed at Agatha and Agatha smiled warmly, holding her hand out to the woman, “Thank you. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>“Oh my god, oh my god.” The woman shook Agatha’s hand roughly, beaming down at her and to Rio she looked a little drunk but maybe she was just excited. Understandable. Agatha often made her feel the same.</p><p>“Could I maybe get a selfie?”</p><p>“Oh I’d love to but I’m here relaxing with my friends. But appreciate your support, thank you.”</p><p>The woman looked more than devastated but only nodded frantically and disappeared off down the beach, stopping a few feet away to turn back and wave at Agatha.</p><p>“Sweet,” Rio teased gently, shooting Agatha a grin.</p><p>“Least my fans don’t grope.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes, turning to watch the woman disappear along the sand.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said suddenly, snapping in her face to get her attention, “You’re burning.”</p><p>Rio looked back over and looked down to where Jen was now staring and saw the light pink skin of Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She was sorry she was burning but it was a good excuse to look.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you?”</p><p>“You’re so smug.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and Agatha swatted at her leg, which only made Rio laugh.</p><p>After that the rest of the beach day went by smoothly.</p><p>They each had two more cocktails and Agatha had half a dozen more people approach her before making their way back up to the villa where they all went their separate ways to the two bedrooms and each took it in turns to shower and change.</p><p>Rio opted for a linen striped shirt dress, figuring they were just lying around the house anyway.</p><p>She was first down and was reclined on the couch scrolling on her phone when Agatha appeared.</p><p>“Jen wants to go out.”</p><p>Rio dropped her phone to her side and sat up slowly on her elbows, frowning up at Agatha. “Really? Has she booked somewhere?”</p><p>“Yeah, just now. For her and Alice.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Rio sat up properly then, unsure what to do with this information. “Right. Okay.”</p><p>“I was going to order pizza and call it an early night.”</p><p>Rio swung her legs around and stood from the couch, “Sure. I’ll keep out of your way. Might head down for a drink or something later but-…”</p><p>“Have one with me before you go?”</p><p>Rio looked around and was surprised to see that Agatha hadn’t moved from where she’d originally stood when she entered the room.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio bit the inside of her cheek, feeling a little awkward suddenly.</p><p>“You look nice,” Agatha offered, so out of the blue that Rio raised her brows and glanced down at herself, tugging lightly at the fabric of her dress.</p><p>She brought her gaze back up and looked Agatha over properly for the first time. And wished she hadn’t.</p><p>She was wearing tan linen pants and a loose white T-shirt that…</p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio said quickly, stepping closer to inspect Agatha’s pink chest. She raised a hand towards it and then remembered herself and pulled her hand away.</p><p>“You were right,” Agatha said with an arched brow, “but if I hear one more smug word about it.”</p><p>“It looks worse.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quickly and met Agatha’s gaze, wondering where and how this relationship suddenly became so full of randomly blurred lines.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t have the chance to respond as Jen announced herself into the space, “Champagne, darlings? We’re celebrating!”</p><p>“Celebrating what?” Agatha asked suspiciously, but Rio nudged her arm and smirked, “Apparently their first proper date.”</p><p>Jen was in a flowing pink dress and heels and Rio had to admire both her taste and Alice’s.</p><p>Jen looked unreal.</p><p>And if Rio’s heart rate weren’t thrumming in tandem with wherever Agatha was in the room, she might just have a little crush on Jen too.</p><p>But Agatha had turned to her and squeezed her arm as she walked past and Rio knew that until she could shake this little crush she was done for.</p><p>No other woman could possibly match up.</p><p>Agatha took charge of popping and pouring the champagne, making sure everyone had an equal share and by the time the glasses were ready to be handed out, Alice had arrived too and Rio had snuck behind her, leaning around to embarrass her by placing multiple kisses to her cheek.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio only gave in and let Alice go when she feared she’d hurt herself trying to wriggle from her grip and she laughed as Alice lightly slapped her cheek, pushing her away.</p><p>“You look good, Wu.”</p><p>“Don’t try that shit on me,” Jen warned Agatha with a glare and Agatha just rolled her eyes, holding the champagne flutes out to Alice and Rio now they were both behaving.</p><p>“You wish.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed Agatha’s as she took her champagne and they locked eyes briefly and all the laughter in Rio’s face died in that instant and she knew three things for sure: she needed to get out the house that night, she needed to get drunk, and she needed to get laid.</p><p>They went to sit out by the pool, each taking a seat around the dining table setup there and each gazing at the view in silence for a while.</p><p>Rio noticed Jen and Alice’s hands meeting across the table and she smiled at her best friend before turning and catching Agatha watching her.</p><p>The brunette looked away when she was caught but Rio felt her stomach lurch at the idea that Agatha had been looking at her.</p><p>She cleared her throat softly and took a sip of her champagne just as Jen filled the silence: “So, Vidal. What’s next?”</p><p>“Uhh,” Rio started, glancing at Alice for help on this one.</p><p>“Eight weeks on a movie then off to Venice. We’re pretty back to back until the end of next year.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” Rio said quietly as she sipped her champagne.</p><p>“Where are you shooting?” Agatha asked and Rio racked her brains for a second before answering:</p><p>“London.”</p><p>She met Agatha’s gaze and saw her nod slowly, seemingly lost in thought as she took a sip of her drink.</p><p>“We’re the same. Agatha’s two shoots to contend with so no Venice for us. No rest for the wicked.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and watched the bubbles float about in her glass. “Especially not when campaigning.”</p><p>“Your first go-round,” Agatha said with a smirk, snapping out of her reverie, raising her brows at Rio, “and already complaining?”</p><p>“You make it sound like you’ve been doing this for decades.”</p><p>“I’m almost forty.”</p><p>“And with three Oscar nominations with one win and one on the way?” Rio matched Agatha’s smirk, “you’re practically a prodigy.”</p><p>She took another sip of her champagne.</p><p>“And what does that make you? A baby?”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha smiled across at her as Jen eyed them both suspiciously, “You two are being weird. What’s going on?”</p><p>“Leave them whilst they’re not biting each other,” Alice said with a wave of her hand, too happy to be concerned about anything Rio was doing.</p><p>“But, actually. The sun’s setting and you know what would be a good idea now everyone’s so happy?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but kept her gaze down on her drink, predicting what would be coming next.</p><p>“A quick snap for socials.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence and Jen interjected before Agatha could outright refuse again. “Baby, maybe not tonight.”</p><p>Rio glanced up at the nickname and couldn’t help but smile a little at Alice’s reaction.</p><p>She looked annoyed initially and then almost as if she’d realised what had happened she blushed a deep crimson and simply nodded.</p><p>Rio caught her eye and sent her a congratulatory wink across the table. She hadn’t got her photos but she’d clearly got her girl.</p><p>So Rio felt herself relax just a little in Agatha’s company again, perhaps the distance of the wide table between them helping her recalibrate a little.</p><p>But just as she felt herself fully relax Alice and Jen began to make a move. Rio felt the panic rise in her slowly at the prospect of being alone with Agatha, in this beautiful place, with the memory of her hands on her body.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could take it.</p><p>“Actually,” she announced as Alice and Jen stood from the table.</p><p>All eyes landed on her and Rio felt Agatha’s gaze on her the most, “I’m going to come with you.”</p><p>“What? Rio, no. We’re-…”</p><p>“I know, I know. I’ll just walk down to the town with you, that’s all.”</p><p>Alice eyed her friend warily but nodded and Jen looked less than happy but Rio didn’t turn to Agatha to see her reaction.</p><p>Instead she pushed her chair back and cleared her throat as she turned to leave.</p><p>“Get back safe,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio paused for a second to acknowledge it, nodding just once but not quite looking at Agatha before she turned to leave with the other two.</p>

<p>Rio stumbled into the villa at well after three am.</p><p>She was hot and tired and considerably drunk but she’d also just spent the last few hours kissing, grinding on, and eventually fucking a hot Italian she met at a bar on the beach.</p><p>She’d had worse nights.</p><p>“Ow, fuck!”</p><p>She’d stumbled right into the console table in the hall.</p><p>Recovering herself and muttering under her breath about inconveniently placed objects, she moved through to the main living area - a little wobbly but managing not to crash into anything again.</p><p>There was movement on the large couch that made her stumble a little over her own feet and she blinked into the semi-darkness until the silhouette of a woman became the face and body of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Oh. Di’ I wake you?”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio for a second, her gaze dropping to the purse still held loosely in her hand and the sand-covered sandals in her other.</p><p>“No, I was awake.”</p><p>“Is late,” Rio trilled, gesturing vaguely at the darkness as she stepped forwards and threw herself onto the couch beside Agatha.</p><p>“Ver’ late,” she added with an heavy slur to her voice.</p><p>Agatha shifted beside her and Rio rolled her head where it now lay on the back of the couch to look at her.</p><p>Agatha was pretty in this light.</p><p>Hell, Agatha was pretty in any light. But now, in the dark, at this hour, she looked softer. And Rio couldn’t help herself as she reached for her, her fingers just grazing her cheek.</p><p>The tips of her fingers travelled lazily along to the tip of Agatha’s nose, and Rio frowned as she walked her two fingers up to the bridge of it, then brushed them back down again.</p><p>“Who made you?” She asked reverently, her gaze now darting across Agatha’s face as she tried to comprehend the magnificence of it when she could barely speak a full sentence.</p><p>“D’you wait up for me?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved or said anything the whole time Rio had been exploring her face but Rio’s hand fell down and landed just an inch or two from Agatha’s forearm and blue eyes fell to watch it. Even in her drunken state Rio thought Agatha looked cautious.</p><p>“I couldn’t sleep. That’s all.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio hummed, in no fit state to be able to tell if the great Agatha Harkness was acting or not.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and lolled her head back around, closing her eyes.</p><p>“I drank too much.”</p><p>“I can see that.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned back to Agatha, beaming stupidly at her and grinning even wider when Agatha’s lips twitched a little and she avoided eye contact.</p><p>“You did wait f’me.”</p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and reached back out for Agatha, grabbing the fabric of her shirt by her shoulder, “You did!”</p><p>Agatha made to take Rio’s hand away and Rio simply turned her hand over to take Agatha’s, wriggling it between their faces.</p><p>“Knew you liked me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio laughed again, seeing this as an opportunity to move closer, her brain not firing on all cylinders but firing on what she considered to be the most important ones in that moment.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath as Rio moved closer to her, their hands still together but now pressed against Rio’s chest.</p><p>“You smell like alcohol and cheap perfume.”</p><p>“Mmm, that’s be Alessia.”</p><p>“Alessia?”</p><p>“Girl,” Rio clarified unhelpfully, not interested at all in this line of questioning.</p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p>Rio shrugged slightly and shuffled some more until she was an inch or two away from Agatha, still holding her hand firmly.</p><p>“S’a girl from the bar.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio watched her blue eyes dart about and she wondered if Agatha were seeing two of her like she were seeing two of Agatha.</p><p>“And what did you do with this girl?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her brain already on more important matters and not on the fact that she’d potentially put herself in a very dangerous and stupid situation by fucking someone on a public beach.</p><p>“Jus’ kiss,” she lied, her eyes dropping to the place she’d like to kiss Agatha.</p><p>Agatha remained quiet and Rio did too, her gaze still down on Agatha’s lips as she conjured up the memory of the last time they were this close and her drunken mind won over as she whispered:</p><p>“D’you remember me?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly and watched as Agatha’s brows rose and her head tilted a little to be at the same angle as Rio’s against the couch.</p><p>Rio couldn’t tell if Agatha hadn’t heard her or if she were so drunk she’d slurred her words too much so she tried again and moved their joined hands from resting against her own chest to resting against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said slowly, pronouncing each syllable with only a sprinkle of slurring, “d’you remember me?”</p><p>Agatha remained silent again and Rio frowned a little as she dropped her gaze down from her face to focus somewhere at her chin, noticing Agatha’s little dimple there and clumsily raising her index finger from the claw she’d formed over Agatha’s hand to touch it.</p><p>Just as she made contact Agatha spoke softly, “Yes. You were as drunk then as you are now.”</p><p>Rio didn’t react for a while, her mind slowly catching up, working out exactly what Agatha was confirming. But steadily she raised her gaze, leaning in just a little more and grinning stupidly as Agatha watched her, “Y’remember? The bar?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and wriggled their joined hands between them, “I thought… too famous… too rich… too pretty… too…”</p><p>But her smile faded slowly as she remembered what had actually happened in the bathroom: that Agatha had spooked and left her alone.</p><p>“Husband,” she muttered quietly, closing her eyes and rolling her head away, her body turning away from Agatha’s but her hand was still being held. “You’ve husband.”</p><p>“Let me take you to bed.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice drifted into her consciousness as Rio squeezed her eyes shut, trying to focus on what was real.</p><p>She could feel the couch cushions beneath her, the sand between her toes, Agatha’s hand in her own.</p><p>She could smell the sweat from her skin from a night of dancing and sex, the fresh lemons in a bowl on the coffee table, Agatha’s perfume.</p><p>She could hear the crickets chirping outside through the open windows, the soft tick of a clock nearby, Agatha moving slowly beside her.</p><p>She could taste the alcohol on her breath, the flavoured lip balm of the girl she’d been groping all night, and the indignity of her current situation.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes slowly and saw Agatha leaning over her, her blue eyes bright in the dim, her lips parted as if she were about to say something else, a strand of hair falling delicately across her brow.</p><p>Rio reached to tuck it clumsily behind her ear again and Agatha let her.</p><p>“Let me take you to bed.”</p><p>Rio huffed a little but didn’t move, releasing her hold on Agatha’s hand and dropping her own hand into her lap instead.</p><p>“Alice an’ Jen? Di’ they get back okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and pursed her lips as she stepped away from Rio, holding her hands out to her now in a move that even Rio recognised as a request, not a demand.</p><p>She accepted them and allowed Agatha to pull her to her feet, mercifully not stumbling too much and correcting herself before their bodies collided.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio mumbled quietly, stealing her hands back again from Agatha and making for the staircase, feeling ever so slightly less wobbly than when she’d walked in.</p><p>“You’ll have to take my bed,” Agatha said from somewhere behind her, “Jen and Alice… well they’re in the other room.”</p><p>Rio had reached the stairs and swivelled to look at Agatha so quickly that she stumbled and fell onto her ass on the second stair. Just as Agatha reached her, she released a laugh and buried her face in her hands, “Finally. She sealed the deal.”</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said firmly, not offering anymore where she took Rio by the arms and lifted her to her feet again, “I’ll help.”</p><p>Rio was still halfway to a laugh and she grinned at Agatha, for a second seeing two pairs of eyes looking at her until they melted into just one. “She’s liked her for ages. Ages and ages and ages.”</p><p>“I know. Jen’s been head over heels for a while too.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, a smile playing on her lips, as she watched Agatha survey her closely, trying to gage how balanced she was.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she reassured, emphasising the “ine” a little to much for someone who was “fine”.</p><p>“I can make it from here.”</p><p>Agatha looked a little like she’d flinched at this but Rio was still trying to keep her mind steady as she turned away from Agatha and the hold on her arms dropped.</p><p>She took two more steps and then stopped, her hand secure on the bannister so at least she could be sure if she fell she wouldn’t fall far.</p><p>“Okay?” Agatha asked, having not moved from the bottom of the stairs, now just four down from Rio.</p><p>“Where’re you sleeping?”</p><p>Rio turned slowly around, almost stumbling as she crossed one foot over the other and watching in something close to amusement as Agatha lurched for her and took two steps up.</p><p>“Careful. The couch.”</p><p>“Silly,” Rio said with an eye roll, shaking her head as she turned back around and began to take slow steps up the rest of the staircase.</p><p>It was when she hit the landing that she registered movement behind her.</p><p>The creaky top step had given her away and Rio paused for a second to determine how she felt about Agatha following her to bed.</p><p>Mortified, for one. Indignant, for another.</p><p>But somewhere deep down she felt warmed by it, touched that a one-time Oscar winner were making sure she didn’t plummet to her death in a villa in Italy.</p><p>And Agatha remained with her as she crawled into bed.</p><p>Rio went to her usual side in the unfamiliar bed and didn’t even stop to brush the sand from her feet as she buried herself beneath the blankets.</p><p>She heard her name muffled somewhere above her but was determined to sleep, determined to stay hidden, until…</p><p>“Rio Vidal, get on your side.”</p><p>The warm embrace of darkness had been torn from her and Rio scrunched her face up against the light as Agatha threw the blankets off of her.</p><p>“On your side,” she repeated again as Rio remained still on her back and tried to grab the blankets back up and over her face.</p><p>Agatha huffed a little and gave up on the War of the Blanket and instead ducked down to tuck her fingers around Rio’s side and heave her onto her side.</p><p>Rio allowed this and didn’t even complain when Agatha patted her leg to get her to move it up so she was in the recovery position. “Don’t move, okay? Can’t have you dying in the night. They’ll think I killed the competition.”</p><p>Rio only laughed a little, the noise catching in her throat as she began to succumb to sleep, “You’ll win. Better actress.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly and Rio felt a gentle touch to her cheek which made her eyes flutter open and she blinked slowly as she readjusted her vision again, aware suddenly that Agatha was close, perhaps as close as she’d been on the couch.</p><p>“I’m gonna sit with you for a second. Just until you’re asleep.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was a whisper now, a gentle timbre that Rio hadn’t heard before. It was so soft if her lips hadn’t moved with it Rio might have missed it.</p><p>But she frowned where she lay and moved her hand up to capture the fingers now tenderly brushing her hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Jus’stay.”</p><p>Rio thought she heard the soft hitch of a breath but she couldn’t tell if it was from her or Agatha and she moved Agatha’s hand down to press her knuckles to her lips. It was barely a kiss, more a brush, and Agatha reacted only to it by nodding and then releasing Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio curled a little more into herself when Agatha moved away and she closed her eyes as she felt the mattress dip on the other side of her.</p><p>By the time Agatha had slipped beneath the sheets, Rio’s breathing had evened out entirely and she was fast asleep.</p><p>Rio woke twice in the night. Or the early hours of the morning, as it was.</p><p>At just after four am, she woke with a start and panicked when she didn’t recognise the room, momentarily forgetting where she was.</p><p>Italy.</p><p>Villa.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Turning slowly over, her eyes landed on the back of Agatha Harkness’s sleeping form, turned away from her and as far over on the other side of the bed as she could be.</p><p>Rio watched her for a few seconds, seeing the steady rhythm of her ribs expanding beneath her T-shirt, and the fresh horror of her entrance just a few hours ago hit her.</p><p>She turned over quickly then and forced herself back into sleep.</p><p>The second time she woke, she woke slower, the creeping dawn easing her where the shutters remained at half mast.</p><p>Blinking into the light she allowed herself to adjust to being awake for a few seconds this time, taking a mental inventory of her body as well as her mind before she slowly turned to see Agatha again.</p><p>This time, Agatha was on her back, still far from her.</p><p>But her hand was flung out towards her and Rio looked down upon it and saw that she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring. She didn’t know why she’d spotted this so suddenly, as if anybody might have, but it struck her the moment she’d laid eyes upon Agatha’s long fingers curled towards her.</p><p>Sure Agatha was still asleep, Rio let her eyes wander up her arm, taking in the light freckles and seeing the subtle shadow of her bicep that she’d felt when Agatha held her on the jet ski the day before.</p><p>Her gaze roamed over her shoulder, to the curve of her jaw, along the planes and lines of a face that people would go to war for.</p><p>Agatha was tragically beautiful, and Rio found herself envying the artists who got to work every day with such a canvas. The people who got to paint her lips and cheeks with rouge, who blackened her eyelashes and were paid to focus in on eyes so hypnotic Rio was sure she could drown in their blue pools.</p><p>And her husband. Agatha’s husband who had access to this face. The man who could kiss it and hold it at will. Rio hoped Ralph knew how lucky he was. She hoped he treasured and worshiped Agatha the way she deserved.</p><p>Though the reality was that she didn’t think Ralph knew at all what he had in Agatha. And she didn’t think he treated her the way she should be treated.</p><p>A movement of Agatha’s made Rio fall back to earth with a jolt and she turned quickly back into her side, furious with herself that she’d been staring at a woman she barely knew whilst she slept.</p><p>She’d mortified herself enough. If Agatha had woken and caught her she was sure she’d have been blacklisted from Hollywood immediately. Me Too’d so fast she would barely be able to breathe the name ‘Agatha Harkness’ again.</p><p>Getting to sleep again after that was a little more difficult.</p><p>The threat of her hangover had now been confirmed.</p><p>Her head was a stormy cloud of regret and pain and her stomach churned with the memory of last night.</p><p>She’d picked up some girl from a bar, danced with her until her feet hurt, and then taken her to the beach to get out some of the frustration she’d been feeling that day.</p><p>God, she hoped no one had caught them.</p><p>She knew it couldn’t have looked good, or glamorous, or sexy.</p><p>It must have looked sweaty and desperate and more than a little pathetic.</p><p>But miraculously, sleep came back to her. Perhaps, she thought as she woke up a few hours later, it was the universe repaying her for making her spend days in close proximity with her longest running crush and most intoxicating person alive.</p><p>The third time she woke she was alone.</p><p>Rio stretched her sore limbs and felt the grainy rub of sand by her feet, as unwelcome as it always was when not on the beach.</p><p>She leant across to touch the bed beside her and found Agatha’s side to be cool which meant she’d disappeared a while ago.</p><p>Perhaps Rio had dreamt her there.</p><p>But no, usually her imagination was a little kinder to her than that.</p><p>She groaned as she rolled into a sitting position on the edge of the bed and rubbed at her eyes before noticing a little care package on the side in the form of a tall glass of water and some aspirin.</p><p><em>Agatha</em>, she thought.</p><p>After drinking down the majority of the water and using it to help knock back the aspirin, she padded through to wash away her sins in the shower.</p><p>There was steam still evident against the glass partition that told her Agatha hadn’t long showered here and she wondered if she’d taken pains to be quiet or if Rio were so dead to the world that Agatha could have recited her inevitable Oscar speech right by her ear and she wouldn’t have noticed.</p><p>Beneath the hot stream of water though, everything felt better.</p><p>The pummelling stream against her skin woke her up to what she could remember of the night before.</p><p>The scent of the perfume of the Italian she’d taken to the beach, the sight of Agatha on the couch, the feel of her hand in her own.</p><p>Rio needed to get a grip. And fast.</p><p>She’d been on the verge of pining last night, of melting before her fellow actress without any thoughts on whether this was a good move personally or professionally.</p><p>Agatha could help to make or break her career.</p><p>She had to do better than this.</p><p>And so, determined and now clean, she stepped out and dried herself as best she could before risking it and slipping into her old room.</p><p>Alice and Jen were nowhere to be found so Rio took her time finding a navy blue bikini, linen shorts and a thin green t-shirt to go over the top. She checked herself in the nearby mirror and decided she could undoubtedly look worse… but she could also look a whole lot better.</p><p>But it would have to do.</p><p>Stepping out into the Italian sun, Rio felt another wave of goodness sink into her body.</p><p>It was what she needed. Sun, sea, silence.</p><p>In front of her lay the pool with the distant view of the bay of Positano. A view Rio could never be sick of.</p><p>But movement on one of the loungers before her alerted her to another view nobody could be sick of.</p><p>“Hey,” she said cautiously, unsure what the reception would be like this morning as she approached the sun lounger beside Agatha’s and chose not to look at her as she took a seat.</p><p>“Hey. Not dead, I see.”</p><p>“Probably thanks to you.”</p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal noise that Rio took as not unfriendly and she stole a glance at the woman, seeing her half under the shade of a parasol, only her legs laying out in the midday sun.</p><p>She’d opted for a black one piece today with cut outs at her sides and was determinedly reading a book. Rio noticed a half-finished cappuccino beside her and the fact that Agatha’s cheeks were a little flushed. Too much sun, she thought.</p><p>“I’m sorry about last night. I got too drunk and I-…”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“No, really. I was probably being a nightmare and really embarrassed myself and-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha looked up suddenly, her face stern but her eyes a little softer than Rio might have expected. “It’s fine. We’ve all been drunk before.”</p><p>Nodding slowly, Rio turned to place her heels on the edge of the bed, wrapping her arms around her legs.</p><p>“Thanks for… helping. Getting me to bed… the water this morning…”</p><p>Agatha was watching her still, her book held up as if she’d turn away any moment to continue reading, but she hadn’t.</p><p>“I think we should clarify something,” she said, her voice a little softer than before. “About when we met.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and nodded, her gaze drifting down to Agatha’s arm as it flexed where she held her book. She wanted to press her face against it, breathe in the sun lotion, hide from the world with Agatha.</p><p>“I was drunk and…”</p><p>But Rio looked up suddenly because Agatha had turned around, placing her book on the bed beside her and her feet on the ground.</p><p>Her ring was back on. Had Rio noticed it wasn’t before? She had a vague memory of thinking about Agatha’s wedding ring. She hoped she hadn’t said anything.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Agatha reached for it, her thumb and forefinger of her right hand now twirling it as she continued: “I was missing Ralph. And you were charming and funny and I… I guess I just… anyway, I’m not into girls. I made a mistake. One I wouldn’t have gone through with anyway. You were too drunk, and too young, and… well it wasn’t anything. I’m not into girls. Nothing happened. I’m happily married. Rio, can we leave it there?”</p><p>Rio watched Agatha closely during her little speech, seeing the way her diction picked up the closer she got to the end of it, the more urgent her words were coming out. How quickly and with practised fingers she was spinning her ring. How Ralph’s name was thrown away from her lips whereas Rio’s was breathed.</p><p>It hurt her brain too much to think about. To assess and breakdown Agatha Harkness’s worst performance to date.</p><p>But Rio was also aware that she was deathly hungover, that she was possibly still drunk, and that no mind is strong enough to fight the delusions that came with a crush.</p><p>She had to focus on what Agatha had said, not what she hoped she meant.</p><p>She had a husband. A husband she loved, and had missed, and Rio was maybe just charming enough that a straight person could want to be close for a second, too close. But that was it. Rio was a girl and Agatha wasn’t into that. And she was happy with her husband.</p><p>Reasonable. Fine. She had to believe it because anything else would destroy her.</p><p>“Okay,” she said slowly, her mind still reeling from its swinging back and forth between wanting to believe Agatha and wanted to accuse her of… of what? Wanting to kiss her? Eight years ago having a crush on her?</p><p>Insane.</p><p>But Agatha had dropped her gaze and was now staring at the ring she held still on her finger and Rio couldn’t help but reach for her hand, catching her fingers and feeling Agatha curl her own around Rio’s.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I implied anything last night. It was so long ago and… it’s just not often a movie star has you up against a bathroom door, that’s all.”</p><p>It wasn’t all, but Rio had to push through, ‘yes, and-ing’ Agatha’s tale to make the both of them feel better.</p><p>This had to be it, she decided.</p><p>Rio could no longer live in this world where Agatha might have, at one point, wanted her.</p><p>So she squeezed Agatha’s hand gently and smiled when she met her gaze again, “You’re burning a little. Will I grab more lotion?”</p><p>Agatha nodded but didn’t say anything and Rio slowly pulled away, but Agatha tugged her hand as she stood and Rio turned back, looking down with a slight frown.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered in her chest and she watched as Agatha frowned back at her, her other hand coming up to her forearm as she stood slowly before her, standing too close between the two adjacent sun beds.</p><p>Suddenly it was eight years ago.</p><p>Only rather than a grimy Chicago bar, they were standing on the edge of a multi-million dollar villa on the Amalfi Coast.</p><p>Agatha’s hand still held hers and Agatha’s other hand was holding her arm so firmly as if Rio had looked like she’d bolt. And Rio didn’t know what was happening, didn’t understand what had happened between ‘I’m happily married’ and Agatha suddenly looking at her like she was the first hot meal she’d seen after a long winter of rations.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>And all the thoughts left Rio’s brain because Agatha Harkness was staring at her lips.</p><p>Her lips that the night before had been all over some girl from a bar, using her as a quick fix to get the thoughts of Agatha out of her head.</p><p>It felt sick, it felt cruel, it felt… and then Agatha had pulled away. She’d released her hold on her and by the time Rio’s brain had caught up, Agatha was halfway back to the villa.</p><p>“I’ll get you a coffee,” she was saying, “and maybe an aperitivo.”</p><p>Rio felt a little faint and she wasn’t sure if it was the hangover, the heat of the sun, or the mixed signals that flared with every other interaction she had with Agatha.</p><p>Was she messing with her? Goading her to try something? Was she wanting Rio to make a move so she could accuse her of something awful?</p><p>Before she could even think on it Rio had slipped her feet into Agatha’s discarded sandals and was marching to the front of the house.</p><p>She bypassed the open plan kitchen area and from the corner of her eye saw Agatha turn to her. She even thought she heard her say her name.</p><p>But Rio was too fast, too determined to escape and catch her breath, and before anything else could happen, she’d exited the villa.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It smelled sweet.</p><p>The kind of sweet that reminded you of candy.</p><p>Though of course it was the ghosts of cocktails past: of spilled grenadine and rum.</p><p>It was dimly lit to hide the sins of the patrons, to disguise the grime of the glasses and the stains of the seats.</p><p>There were posters on every inch of every wall. But of nothing, of no one, as inconsequential as the people they smiled down upon.</p><p>This was the kind of bar that nobody frequented and where everybody who did was called as such.</p><p>And so it was the perfect bar for the little improv troupe to fall into.</p><p>Some celebrating; some commiserating.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, Oscar hopeful and Hollywood heavyweight was in their midst, and so no one was on their best behaviour.</p><p>“She’s fucking hot,” someone breathed into Rio Vidal’s ear as she stared at the actress from where she sat squeezed in the corner of a curved booth with her fellow improvers - the underlings of the troupe.</p><p>“God she’s like one of these statues,” someone else said from across the way.</p><p>“A fucking hottie with a body,” Alice added helpfully with half her mind on her bottle of beer and half her mind on Agatha.</p><p>“A goddess,” Rio concluded, her own attention split between Agatha and the beer she cradled in her hands; the fifth of the night, the last she could afford.</p><p>“Seriously, I hear her husband is hot too. Have you seen him? It’s actually unreal.”</p><p>“Unfair.”</p><p>“Sad,” Alice murmured as Rio leant into her and laughed against her ear.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had been the talk of the night.</p><p>Because of course.</p><p>She’d rocked up without any warning. Simply because she was filming in Chicago and one of the improv leaders had been an extra on the set.</p><p>Perhaps she was lonely, perhaps she was bored, but it didn’t matter. She’d turned up.</p><p>On the verge of an Oscar nomination and at their little show; the troupe felt insane with it.</p><p>They felt crazy with the power.</p><p>And Rio Vidal felt nothing at all.</p><p>She’d worked so hard and still nothing.</p><p>Alice had been telling her for years she had something and yet, and yet…</p><p>But then she’d spotted Agatha Harkness in the crowd and she’d shown off.</p><p>She’d been louder and funnier and sharper and better than she’d been in weeks.</p><p>Because Agatha was there. Because Agatha was a woman to impress.</p><p>And now she sat, drunk, convinced she’d left an impression on the woman who’d had eyes on her all night.</p><p>But girls in the audience who stared at Rio usually came over. They usually cashed in on the time spent watching her.</p><p>They usually weren’t famous actresses with handsome husbands.</p><p>So Rio sat, unadmired and tipsy, watching as the seniors in her group absorbed the smiles and the laughs from Agatha Harkness.</p><p>In any just world Rio would be there too.</p><p>But then Alice shook her shoulder and she turned to her best friend and smiled lamely, her eyes already hooded and slow to cooperate with her hazy mind.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re staring again. She’s hot but she’s not interested.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and then shrunk back a little, turning back to the small group at the bar that encircled the object of her most keen attention.</p><p>She raised her beer to her lips, now warm and flat, and saw that Agatha was looking at her.</p><p>Not for the first time that night.</p><p>Rio suddenly felt warmer than the beer that slipped down her throat, felt dizzier than the tequila earlier had made her feel, felt every second that they maintained eye contact.</p><p>Agatha was the one to break the eye contact.</p><p>Because of course she was.</p><p>Rio was drunk, she knew that.</p><p>She was probably staring, she assumed that.</p><p>Agatha was the most famous, most beautiful woman she’d ever seen.</p><p>How could she not stare?</p><p>She told herself she had to behave.</p><p>She looked away, focused on her friends. Ignored the way the conversation kept steering around to Agatha again - if she enjoyed the show, how rich she was, if she would introduce anyone to her agent, if she’d come back to see their summer show.</p><p>After two more too-warm beers and an unwise shot of tequila bought by Alice, she stumbled her way into the bathroom.</p><p>There, above the cracked porcelain of the sink, she took slow breaths to stem the nausea that threatened to overcome her pleasantly drunken state.</p><p>“Feeling okay?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head in the direction of the speaker, assuming a friend, unable to recognise the familiar voice she’d only previously heard through a screen.</p><p>The bathroom descended into silence again and as Rio calmed her system down she felt well enough to turn and lean back against the basin.</p><p>Apparently she still wasn’t alone.</p><p>“You were good.”</p><p>Brown eyes flashed open and Agatha Harkness came into focus, as magnificent as Rio remembered.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uttered, a little too drunk for her body to catch up with her mind.</p><p>“Whadd’re you doing here?”</p><p>Agatha smiled and leant up against the basin next to Rio’s, watching her with blue eyes that made Rio feel weak at the knees.</p><p>“You’re the best of them.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio hummed a soft question, rubbing her temple as she tried to focus on what the goddess in the room with her was saying.</p><p>“You’re drunk.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“Definitely.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rubbed her face with her hands, unable to deny or fight back.</p><p>“Do you want me to get you some water?”</p><p>Rio dropped her hands.</p><p>She looked across at Agatha, frowning at her as she stared at her. She was closer than she’d been before, she was sure of it.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Ah-gah-tha.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and tilted her head to watch Rio, her eyes darting from heavy dark eyes to a lopsided grin, “That’s my name.”</p><p>“S’pretty.”</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“Pretty.”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly and Rio’s gaze dropped. Dropped to perfect teeth, to perfect lips.</p><p>“Smile’s pretty.”</p><p>Agatha moved a little closer and Rio’s gaze dropped again.</p><p>She looked at the plain white T-shirt Agatha was wearing. She looked at the pale arm at her side. The long fingers. The rings on one of them.</p><p>She reached for them.</p><p>“S’pretty,” she said again, her voice dropping as she held Agatha’s left hand, reverently touching the diamond there.</p><p>“Lucky sonofabitch,” Rio murmured almost to herself but not quite low enough to not be caught.</p><p>If she’d looked up she’d have seen Agatha raise her brows at her.</p><p>“It’s Rio, isn’t it? Like ‘river’.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio continued to toy with the rings on Agatha’s finger, her gaze drifting in focus as she did.</p><p>“Vidal?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio began to frown where she still held Agatha’s hand, turning her engagement ring over so she could no longer see the diamond.</p><p>“I’d get you a bigger one. S’big everyone could see.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio looked back up again, smiling a little, now confident that she absolutely could buy Agatha Harkness a larger ring than her rich financier husband had.</p><p>His five million net worth was nothing to her five dollars, seventy cents in her current account.</p><p>Agatha seemed amused enough that she wasn’t deterred, that her confidence grew, that she was convinced she could do it and Agatha would welcome it.</p><p>“So pretty.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mmhm?”</p><p>“You sure I can’t get you that water?”</p><p>Rio grinned, dropping her hold of Agatha’s hand and forgetting she’d just promised her a much larger ring.</p><p>“No. Only delicious, shitty beer f’me.”</p><p>She threw her hands to her face again and huffed out a breath, laughing at her own little joke.</p><p>But then she was moving.</p><p>A soft hand on her wrist steered her and her eyes were now uncovered, unfocused on the back of a brunette head of hair as she was pulled to a toilet stall.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of her legs moving beneath her and her body responding to something her mind couldn’t quite grasp yet.</p><p>But then she felt a slight darkness descend.</p><p>A dimmer light than before.</p><p>The hard feel of something behind her back.</p><p>The scent of something lightly floral, very welcome.</p><p>A click.</p><p>A breath.</p><p>Two hands either side of her head.</p><p>“How drunk are you?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“How drunk are you?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, her eyes heavier now than they had felt before.</p><p>Maybe because it was darker, maybe because her body was fully relaxed back against something, maybe because she was breathing in something that felt soothing, felt safe.</p><p>“No’drunk.”</p><p>She blinked as she looked into blue eyes, much closer than they’d been before.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind she realised the scent that was soothing her so was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She laughed at the absurdity of this realisation, at the knowledge that Agatha was close enough that she moved her hand just a few inches and she held the hem of Agatha’s t-shirt in her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>“Pretty.”</p><p>“Can I kiss you, Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio’s expression changed as her brain caught up with the words breathed out before her.</p><p>Her fingers were still clutching the fabric of the shirt of the woman in front of her.</p><p>And she could only breathe in her perfume, could only see those blue eyes now focused further down her own face, could only feel her warm breath against her lips.</p><p>Rio had always thought she belonged on the stage.</p><p>She thought she belonged to an audience.</p><p>But now, as drunk as she was, her brain recognised something that when she was sober again only her soul would acknowledge: she belonged to, and with, Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“I… <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Agatha leant in and Rio sucked in a sharp breath of anticipation, her eyes fluttering closed as she waited for the pressure of those perfect lips against her own.</p><p>Perhaps it was punishment for closing her eyes when she had someone so beautiful before her, perhaps it was simply that her luck had run out, but the noise of people entering the bathroom meant that Agatha had pulled away.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open when she felt the loss of her and she saw the flash of horror in blue eyes.</p><p>But then a hand was on her shoulder and she was moved aside so that the door could be opened and Agatha could disappear.</p><p>It happened so quickly that Rio missed the soft “sorry” as Agatha had passed. She didn’t register the soft squeeze of her arm, the pain in her gaze as she swept away.</p><p>And Rio was left in the bathroom stall, silent and in a state of shock.</p><p>She managed, just, to turn and lock the stall door again, keeping still and quiet until the women who had ruined her night had left.</p><p>When alone again, she reappeared in the main bar, lost and desperately horny, but unclear and unsure as to what had just happened.</p><p>It was Alice who greeted her on her way out.</p><p>Alice who wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>Alice who informed her that Agatha Harkness had bolted not five minutes ago.</p><p>“Maybe got her fill of slumming it for the night,” she’d said against Rio’s ear, as if she’d welcome the joke, as if she’d laugh at it.</p><p>But Rio could only feel the loss of Agatha.</p><p>The aching need she’d had for her that would never now be satiated.</p><p>And so she accepted the beer thrust towards her, took more shots than she should have been allowed, and she stumbled home with Alice.</p><p>By morning she was a shell of her former self, with only a vague memory of Agatha, and a deep loneliness she couldn’t explain.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio tread the familiar path down to the port, focusing on her breathing, on stretching her aching muscles out, and on everything that wasn’t Agatha Harkness.</p>
<p>The things she knew about her: married to Ralph, a son called Nicky, a well-respected and incredibly famous actress, someone who would look after you when you were drunk, someone who tried to protect you, someone who set Rio’s body on fire and mind and heart racing.</p>
<p>But straight. Straight and married to a man.</p>
<p>Ralph.</p>
<p>By the time Rio had walked to the other side of the bay she felt better.</p>
<p>Distance from Agatha seemed to help. And in the back of her mind she knew she was still suffering from an almighty hangover which can’t have helped the situation.</p>
<p>Because nothing had happened. Agatha had looked a little too closely at her, but then again she was an actress. Perhaps she was studying her because she was interested in human behaviour, in how others carried themselves, in the physicality of a person so different to herself. That must be it.</p>
<p>They were both adults, both in the same profession, both currently working their asses off to convince the world they were worthy of the highest award Hollywood could provide.</p>
<p>Insofar as all that was true, they were colleagues and rivals. It was an intense relationship anyway.</p>
<p>Made more intense by Rio’s inability to get a grip.</p>
<p>As her lips pressed against the cool glass of the beer she’d secured herself at a small chiosco opposite the bay, all thoughts of Agatha disappeared.</p>
<p>She was a goddamn movie star. She was one of the favourites to win an Oscar. She got a twelve minute standing ovation at Cannes. She was young and hot and free and could get any woman she wanted.</p>
<p>By the time she was on her second beer, she heard her name being called across the way and she turned to squint into the sun until the familiar figure of Alice Wu-Gulliver appeared before her looking concerned and a little annoyed.</p>
<p>“Where the fuck have you been?”</p>
<p>Rio held up her beer and turned to the barman to ask for another. “Right here. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Agatha said you practically ran away this morning.”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and turned to watch as Alice took a seat on the low stool beside her, “I just need some air.”</p>
<p>“And more alcohol? We heard you stumble in last night. Agatha was discreet with the details but from what I gather you were a total mess.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned back to begin drawing idly into the condensation on her glass.</p>
<p>“I hear you finally sealed the deal?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ignore me. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, Alice. Only our little escape for two days to get some rest and alone time for the first time in <em>ages</em> has been interrupted by your new girlfriend and her boss.”</p>
<p>Alice was silent for a while but accepted the beer placed before her with a soft murmur of a “grazie”.</p>
<p>“I knew you were pissed about it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not pissed I’m just… hungover. Tired. Embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“How bad was it?”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and rubbed her temple, “She had to put me in the recovery position. And I’m pretty sure I asked her to stay in the bed with me.”</p>
<p>“My god, Rio. I told you to make friends, not proposition her.”</p>
<p>“I <em>didn’t</em> proposition her. I just… maybe held her hand a bit and sat a little close. And in case <em>you</em> forgot, <em>you</em> are the reason we technically had to share a bed in the first place.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and Alice grimaced into her beer.</p>
<p>After a beat of silence Alice eventually said:</p>
<p>“Jen says she likes you. Says she’s never seen Agatha soften for someone so quickly before.”</p>
<p>Groaning a little, Rio turned to look at Alice with a deep furrow in her brow, “She’s an actress. The best one we have. She’s just playing along because you and Jen are all over each other and she’ll be stuck with me for the next few months until this goddamn season is over. And even then, if you both decide it’s a longterm thing… we’re stuck.”</p>
<p>Alice’s smiling face softened and she reached across to place her beer-cooled hand on Rio’s bare knee, providing a welcome balm against the heat of the day.</p>
<p>“Actually, I think she likes you. Most people do so it’s not that shocking. Maybe relax around her a little. I know you’re a fan and she’s a hot woman but… try to relax. Like you say, we’ve a lot of time to get through and it would be better if you two could actually be friends.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed and despite the welcome coolness of it she pushed Alice’s hand from her knee. “I’m not sure we’ll ever actually be friends.”</p>
<p>“Why not? She’s sparky. She’s funny. Jen says she’s generous and loyal and her kid is cute. Plus she got your sorry ass to bed last night. The amount of times I’ve had to bribe you to bed with more tequila I cannot even count.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. She’s a <em>Saint</em>.”</p>
<p>“Only to her friends. Otherwise she’s a bitch,” Alice smirked, “whereas you’re the opposite. Great with everyone else and an absolute horror to anyone who knows you.”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck off.”</p>
<p>Alice released a cackle as Rio tried to push her off her stool and they both received unimpressed glares from the posers and preeners of Positano as they walked by.</p>
<p>When they’d both calmed down and Rio was well into half of her beer, Alice quickly catching up, Rio broached the next most important subject of the holiday: Alice’s romance.</p>
<p>“So. How was it? Earth-shattering?”</p>
<p>Alice smiled and blushed a little, turning slightly to try and hide it. “I really like her. I’m hopeful it’s… that maybe she’s the one.”</p>
<p>“The one?” Rio asked in complete surprise, her worldview changing slightly as she took Alice in. “You can’t leave me single and alone. That’s not the deal.”</p>
<p>“There was no <em>deal</em>, Rio Vidal. Just your assumption that we’d be single forever and die hand in hand in our late nineties on the terrace of our beachfront property.”</p>
<p>“And you’ve decided to renege on this deal for a hot woman with at least a foot on you?”</p>
<p>“Not a foot,” Alice insisted with a laugh, “But yes. I hope so. I think, I think I really like this one.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m happy for you,” Rio grinned genuinely, reaching to take Alice’s hand and squeeze it gently. “And I can’t imagine for a second that she wouldn’t feel the same.”</p>
<p>“We’re taking it slow but yeah,” Alice grinned back and squeezed Rio’s hand right back. “So you and Agatha might just have to deal with each other far beyond the season.”</p>
<p>Rio hummed and turned back to take a drink of her beer, wondering how a life with Agatha constantly in it would work out. But just because Alice was with Jen didn’t mean Agatha would be there every time she saw her.</p>
<p>But this belief was shattered when Alice spoke again: “So Jen was suggesting a bit of a triple date night. Me, you, Agatha, Ralph, and Jen.”</p>
<p>Rio almost choked on her beer and turned to Alice with wide eyes, “What? You can’t be serious. I’m not fifth wheeling.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on! You’d be there for me. I’d need you there!”</p>
<p>“Alice, no. That’s insane. It would be humiliating. Last time I saw Ralph… it was a disaster. I already told you yesterday: no more favours.”</p>
<p>“Rio, you’re the most popular piece of ass in Hollywood right now. Get over yourself and either find a girl to bring or come alone. Who cares. Do this for me.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed but smiled just a little, the beer easing her down just enough to be able to accept the compliment and lessen the inevitable humiliation of rocking up somewhere with two other couples.</p>
<p>“Fine. But only for you. And only once.”</p>
<p>“Deal.”</p>
<p>They finished their beers and Rio was feeling all the benefits of being in a port town in Italy all of a sudden.</p>
<p>With her best friend tucked into her side as they strolled back up to the villa she couldn’t help but feel lighter than she had that morning, more at peace.</p>
<p>The doom that had settled with her hangover had disappeared entirely. And once again she was just a person on vacation with her best friend, a pretty interloper, and her best friend’s crush.</p>
<p>Not a bad place to be.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived back to the villa it was early evening but the sun was still hot, still beating down on the bay and the hills that surrounded it where the villa was perched.</p>
<p>Rio walked with Alice through the open planned living space and out onto the deck to find Jennifer and Agatha both sitting on sun loungers; Agatha was in the sun lounger she’d been in earlier and Jen was now occupying Rio’s.</p>
<p>They were both drinking aperols and both looked up when Alice and Rio circled round to them. Alice perched on the end of Jen’s bed and kissed her shoulder sweetly whereas Rio remained standing.</p>
<p>“There you are,” Jen announced loudly, pulling Alice closer to her, “running off with stolen sandals? Are you having a breakdown or something?”</p>
<p>“I just needed some air,” Rio said with a shrug, still too on her high to be brought down by Jen’s remarks.</p>
<p>“Yeah because a hillside pool is completely devoid of any air whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes but noticed Agatha moving her legs up to cross beneath herself where she sat and she took it as an invitation to sit on the very end of the bed.</p>
<p>“Go off in search of your beach friend?” She asked as Rio placed her hands behind her and leant back, closing her eyes as she looked up to the sun.</p>
<p>“No, I tend not to return once I’ve had my fun.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” Alice said quickly, slapping Rio’s leg and making her look back across at her, “Who? What did you do on a beach?”</p>
<p>“Apparently made out with <em>Alessia</em>,” Agatha drawled, and Rio turned to see her watching her closely, a glint of amusement in her eye. She knew she was punishing her for running away earlier.</p>
<p>“Alessia?” Alice asked with a frown, “Who is she?”</p>
<p>In all honesty, Rio hadn’t remember the girl’s name until Agatha had just said it and she bit down on her lip as she returned her gaze back to Alice, wondering whether to be fully honest or to deny, deny, deny.</p>
<p>But it was too late.</p>
<p>“Some girl from a bar?” Alice filled in herself, shaking her head in disbelief. “And you took her to the beach? Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and shot Agatha a look before she leant towards her best friend who was less her friend in that moment and more the woman she paid to look after her image, to source her jobs, to control the press around her.</p>
<p>“We were careful.”</p>
<p>“I doubt that.”</p>
<p>“Alice. It was just…”</p>
<p>“Rio, if you try for even a second to pretend you just made out with her I will drown you in this pool.”</p>
<p>Rio returned to chewing on her lip and ran a hand through her sun-dried hair that was a little more wavy than usual, a little more wild for the chlorine and the salt water.</p>
<p>“You did <em>not</em> have sex on the beach,” Jennifer suddenly piped up, watching Rio with wide eyes and a mixture of disgust and awe. “You’re in the middle of a campaign.”</p>
<p>Rio groaned and shook her head, “No one saw. It was dark and quiet and-…”</p>
<p>“You said you just made out,” Agatha said in a tone that sounded oddly accusatory and Rio turned to look at her, feeling strangely worse that Agatha now knew compared to Alice knowing.</p>
<p>“I-…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Alice said suddenly, standing from her seat, “I need to talk to my client in private.”</p>
<p>“<em>Client?</em>” Rio gaped suddenly, staring up at Alice in shock, “Alice don’t be-…”</p>
<p>“Inside. <em>Now.</em>”</p>
<p>With that, Alice turned away and marched back towards the villa, leaving a shocked Rio staring after her with her mouth slightly agape.</p>
<p>“Holy shit that was hot,” Jen muttered almost to herself as she stared after Alice and Rio grimaced as she slowly went to follow her best friend back in, knowing she was already in for a world of hurt.</p>
<p>Once inside Alice grabbed her arm and marched her to their old shared bedroom, throwing Rio onto the end of the bed and beginning to pace.</p>
<p>“Not only could you have been <em>arrested</em>, what if the paps got a shot of you? What if some tourist got a photo of Rio Vidal fucking some local on a sun lounger?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t,” Rio said softly, feeling more than a little small, “no one saw.”</p>
<p>“And how do you know that?! How, Rio?!”</p>
<p>Rio took a deep breath and crossed her arms over her chest, trying to regulate her heart rate. “Alice, I promise you-…”</p>
<p>“No. You don’t get to do that. We have worked <em>so</em> hard to get you here. First Ralph and now… I swear if you’ve fucked it all up by fucking-…”</p>
<p>“It would be on the internet by now!” Rio shouted, throwing her arms out before her, “It would be everywhere! You’d have <em>seen</em> it. Alice, please, this isn’t-…”</p>
<p>“How could you have been so stupid? Honestly, Rio. You usually have more sense than this. What is wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Rio slammed her mouth shut, unable to tell Alice exactly what was going on for fear she’d laugh at her or she’d call her a moron, or any other insult she deserved.</p>
<p>But how could she tell her best friend that she was currently experiencing a true or maybe imagined flirtation with a married actress, a married older actress who had once pinned her against a toilet stall, a married older actress who had touched her in ways that weren’t strictly necessary when riding a jet ski with someone, a married older actress with a child, a married older actress who was probably not flirting at all with Rio, and Rio was going crazy with it.</p>
<p>“Rio. You need to-…”</p>
<p>But there was a knock on the door and Alice stopped, running her hands through her hair and pacing again, “What is it?”</p>
<p>Rio had expected Jen to be there to try and calm Alice down or else pull her into the other bedroom alone if her reaction to Alice’s outburst earlier had been anything to go by.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t Jen.</p>
<p>It was Agatha.</p>
<p>The door opened slowly and Agatha stepped inside, glancing between Alice and Rio and holding up two glasses of clear liquid.</p>
<p>Rio stared at her, unsure what she was seeing but she accepted the glass that was suddenly offered to her, Agatha now in front of her, watching her closely.</p>
<p>“Come down to the pool and take photos with me. Post them on your socials. If anything comes out about…” she cleared her throat and turned around to Alice to hold out the second glass to her, “if there’s anything about what happened last night it would have been on the internet already. But we’re here. People will want to see us here. They’ll be excited we’re together. Take some photos and make the most of it.”</p>
<p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>Agatha, who had been so against any sort of pictures of the two of them on social media.</p>
<p>Agatha, who had denied and denied Alice’s requests to get snaps of them at dinner or by the pool or in the water.</p>
<p>Agatha, who was now looking at her with an expectant look in her eye, her hand motioning to the cool glass in Rio’s hand as if wondering why she hadn’t drunk it yet.</p>
<p>But Alice broke the silence first, clearly struggling with the same thing as Rio.</p>
<p>“But… but you were so against-…”</p>
<p>“I know,” Agatha said gruffly, glancing at Alice before turning back to Rio, “I’ve changed my mind.”</p>
<p>Rio opened and closed her mouth a few times, unable to form words for a while, but Alice had sprung into action before she managed to.</p>
<p>She’d leapt at Agatha and wrapped her free arm so suddenly around Agatha’s neck that the older woman stumbled back a little and in being so caught off guard she laughed and actually returned the embrace with a loose arm around Alice’s middle.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Alice said genuinely, pulling away to grin at Agatha and touching her cheek briefly, “This will…”</p>
<p>“You should speak to Jen first. She has to ‘okay’ everything but I’m happy if she is. Whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She stared at Agatha as Alice made a soft noise of delight and disappeared from the room still clutching whatever liquid had been poured into the glass for her.</p>
<p>“It’s tequila,” Agatha clarified, motioning to Rio’s glass now they were alone together.</p>
<p>Rio dropped her gaze to it and hesitated for just a second before she raised it to her lips and downed it in one. It was a shot’s worth, maybe a shot and a half of crisp, clean tequila, which meant it went down as easily as any shot of pure alcohol could.</p>
<p>And when she was done she lowered the glass and watched as Agatha ran a hand through her hair and shuffled a little on the spot.</p>
<p>“What changed your mind?”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed a little and went to perch on the windowsill, curling her fingers around the edge of it as she watched Rio, “You looked so helpless back there I thought it was the least I could do.”</p>
<p>Rio chewed the inside of her cheek and dropped her eyes to her empty glass, watching as the last drop of clear liquid moved with each swirl of it.</p>
<p>Agatha was doing her another favour. She just didn’t know why.</p>
<p>“Photos of us will benefit me far more than they’ll benefit you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know… every other conversation I have now your name comes up.”</p>
<p>“It does?”</p>
<p>“Mmhm.”</p>
<p>Rio placed her glass down on the edge of the bed and stood to move over to Agatha, watching as her back straightened out and she looked cautious suddenly.</p>
<p>Rio gave her every opportunity to move away, to pull back, but when she didn’t her hand found purchase on Agatha’s cheek and she brushed her thumb delicately across her high cheekbone, a little frown forming on her face as she took Agatha in.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the two beers and the tequila talking, but she thought there was now a faint blush on Agatha’s cheeks where she still held her.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded gently, careful not to dislodge Rio’s hand and Rio watched in surprise as Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed and she raised her hand to hold Rio’s wrist lightly, her face turning a fraction of an inch so the corners of her lips grazed Rio’s palm.</p>
<p>It was so soft, so intimate that Rio forgot herself and moved closer, ducking her head slightly in order to press a kiss to Agatha’s other cheek.</p>
<p>But before she made contact, there was noise in the hall and Rio pulled back properly, her hand reluctantly dropping from Agatha as she turned to see who would be arriving now.</p>
<p>Just as Jen stepped into the room Agatha pushed herself off the ledge beside her and muttered: “don’t say anything”.</p>
<p>“Jen.”</p>
<p>“Agatha.”</p>
<p>Rio now took Agatha’s position on the window ledge, shrinking back a little from the furious looking woman in the doorway and noticing that Alice was just behind her.</p>
<p>“You can’t just offer-…”</p>
<p>“Come on, Rio is all anyone is talking about. It’ll be her or me and right now my money is on her. A couple vacation snaps and that’s it. You can have full creative control.”</p>
<p>Jen huffed and scowled over at Rio who was still hiding behind Agatha slightly, which, admittedly she wasn’t too proud of.</p>
<p>“Fine. Vidal, these pictures of you on the beach better not come out. Can’t have anyone thinking it was Agatha you were fucking.”</p>
<p>It was Rio’s turn to blush at this and she cleared her throat quietly as Agatha turned to her and offered her a hand, “Let’s get this over with.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked and momentarily forgot herself as everyone stared at her and Agatha actually wriggled her fingers at her. But she took her hand and found it to be just as warm and comforting as it had felt the previous night when she was off her face drunk.</p>
<p>They walked like that, unnecessarily hand in hand down to the pool area and Agatha only released her hand again when Jen pulled Agatha in the other direction.</p>
<p>“We’re getting one shot and that is <em>it</em>,” Jen announced firmly, “and we will only use it if I am happy with it. Goddamn Agatha Harkness does not hang about pools with nobody actors.”</p>
<p>“Hey,” Alice and Rio said quickly and even Agatha slapped Jen’s arm lightly. “Play nice.”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Jen said in lieu of an apology and shot Alice a small smile over Agatha’s shoulder that promised she was at least half joking.</p>
<p>Whilst Jen worked on the composition of the shot, Alice turned to Rio and began fluffing up her hair, to what aim, Rio had no idea.</p>
<p>“You got a swimsuit on beneath that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah but isn’t that a bit much?”</p>
<p>“No, not when it’s your one shot to be across the internet with Agatha. Take it off.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and crossed her arms over herself to seamlessly slip her t-shirt over her head and tossed it in the sun bed.</p>
<p>“These too,” Alice instructed, motioning to Rio’s shorts.</p>
<p>“Don't be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“And don’t be a prude, Miss I Fucked A Stranger On The Beach.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed but supposed she deserved that and she shuffled out of her linen shorts, feeling a bit like an idiot just standing awkwardly in her bikini.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay!” Jen announced, having been strolling around the area with her phone and Agatha in tow as a test subject to check the light.</p>
<p>“Two options-…” but she stopped as she spotted what Rio was now wearing and rolled her eyes, “Really, Alice? This isn’t a porno.”</p>
<p>Rio looked down at herself, suddenly fearful she’d somehow stripped naked without meaning to. But she hadn’t. She was still very much covered up where it mattered.</p>
<p>“They’re by the pool, they’re friends, they’re on vacation. It would be weird for Agatha to be in a bathing suit and Rio to not be. Plus she looks more femme like this, it’ll help with the rumours.”</p>
<p>“What rumours?” Agatha asked suddenly, watching the scene from the glass barrier that separates the edge of the hills from the drop below it.</p>
<p>“Well two hot women on vacation together, one a lesbian?” Alice asked with raised brows and Rio had to look away for fear she was blushing too much at the insinuation.</p>
<p>“Agatha is happily married,” Jen accused with a frown and Rio was beginning to wonder if ‘happily married’ were tattooed somewhere on Agatha’s body.</p>
<p>“I know,” Alice agreed with a slight frustration in her tone, “everyone knows. So Rio not rocking up looking like a total-…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it,” Rio interjected with a frown, slapping Alice’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“-… well, it’ll help the cause.”</p>
<p>Alice had clearly won the battle and had turned to Rio to take her arm and whisper in her ear, “Sorry. I just want you in that bikini for the shot. You look hot.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and poked Alice in the ribs before she moved over to where Agatha and Jen were and offered herself up with a little display of opening her arms to Jennifer, “Where do you want me?”</p>
<p>Jen got to work immediately and had no qualms about moving Rio without asking if it were okay she touch her. It felt a lot like being in a set or in a makeup trailer and so Rio didn’t mind.</p>
<p>But things changed when Jen started moving Agatha and it was Agatha who was touching her now, rather than Jen.</p>
<p>Jen had positioned Rio to be leaning her elbows back against the top of the glass barrier, her right leg up and bent so her foot was back on it.</p>
<p>She’d forced Rio to face forward and her hair to drape across her shoulders, spending time in adjusting it until she was satisfied.</p>
<p>And then Agatha.</p>
<p>Agatha was positioned next to Rio, facing her.</p>
<p>Jen had made her place her right elbow on the barrier and her left hand on Rio’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand was warm and Rio glanced to the side to see that she was watching her, her steely blue gaze intense in the early evening sun.</p>
<p>It was the golden hour and behind Agatha’s head was a halo of light. She looked breathtaking and Rio was glad she had the barrier behind her to hold her up, to keep her from melting before her.</p>
<p>“No,” Alice was saying suddenly, holding her own phone up to look through the camera.</p>
<p>“The hand on Rio’s shoulder looks weird. Agatha, put it on her stomach.”</p>
<p>“My stomach?” Rio asked in panic, breaking her pose and standing up properly, “Why my stomach?”</p>
<p>“It’s just less awkward than your shoulder. These needs to just look like two friends shooting the shit together by their ridiculous pool,” Alice shouted back across the pool, frowning at the dramatic reaction of her friend.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Jen agreed, “makes it easier to see her ring too.”</p>
<p>Rio blanched a little and slowly settled back into position, glancing at Agatha as Jen continued to fluff her hair behind her and Agatha asked: “This okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio said quickly, properly blushing now she’d caused such a fuss and turning away again. “Totally fine.”</p>
<p>She tensed as Agatha moved her hand down to rest against her stomach, and glanced askance at Agatha again, seeing that she was looking down at where her hand pale hand was now resting against Rio’s tanned skin.</p>
<p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and forced herself to relax, feeling the slight movements of Agatha’s fingers as she tried to find the most natural pose on Rio’s flat abs.</p>
<p>Not unused to being touched during photoshoots, and not even unfamiliar with posing with Agatha now for photos, this shouldn’t have felt odd.</p>
<p>And after yesterday, with Agatha’s hands all over her torso, this should have felt natural.</p>
<p>But Rio’s body was screaming at her that Agatha Harkness was touching her publicly, for millions of people to see, and when Jen pushed Agatha a couple inches towards her she shifted uncomfortably so that Agatha dropped her hand from her.</p>
<p>“Shoulder’s fine,” she muttered quietly and went to place her hand back there before Rio grabbed it suddenly and placed it back just below her sternum, over where her diaphragm would be.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Rio reassured just as softly, keeping her hand over Agatha’s until she was sure she wouldn’t pull away.</p>
<p>Agatha only nodded once and kept her hand still against Rio’s skin.</p>
<p>Jen eventually moved away and went to stand by Alice to take the shot. Both Agatha and Rio tried smiling, tried smiling at each other, but neither Jen nor Alice were happy and both frequently pointed out the sun going in and the golden hour coming to a close.</p>
<p>“More energy! Look like you like each other!”</p>
<p>Rio laughed a little and shot Agatha a smile, raising a brow, “Nothing says ‘I like you’ more than a fake photoshoot on vacation.”</p>
<p>Agatha only rolled her eyes and moved the hand that wasn’t still over Rio’s stomach to poke Rio in the ribs suddenly, expertly finding her most sensitive point and causing Rio to burst out a laugh and lurch forwards.</p>
<p>Agatha laughed with her and caught Rio’s back as she threw herself back again, the shock of the jab making her forget she was on the precipice of a cliff with a thin, single pane of glass protecting her from here and infinity.</p>
<p>“Careful!”</p>
<p>Rio curled her arms around the arm that held her steady and caught her breath back steadily, not realising that Agatha had pressed against her side and now was basically just holding her where they stood.</p>
<p>“We got it,” Jen sang as the two women at the edge of the pool turned to smile at the other, suddenly both shy in their hold but neither pulling away.</p>
<p>It was Rio who broke the spell, peeling herself from Agatha gingerly, and feeling suddenly cool in the warm air without Agatha close by.</p>
<p>But she shook it off, forced herself to focus as she went to look over Alice’s shoulder at the photo they’d chosen of the hundreds they’d taken.</p>
<p>Rio was on the way to lurching forwards, her mouth open in a laugh and her eyes wide with surprise.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hand remained pride of place on her front and her right hand was close by her ribs where she’d just delivered the fatal blow.</p>
<p>Agatha looked pleased with herself, smug and beautiful in the light.</p>
<p>They looked good together, even Rio could see that. And perhaps Agatha could too because she’d appeared at her side and had briefly squeezed Rio’s hand where they stood, both silently acknowledging what was clear in the photo: Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal were about to break the internet.</p>
<p>“Ring still obvious,” Jen said slowly, scrutinising every inch of the photo and now literally zooming in to see every inch of the two of them up close.</p>
<p>“Can we not zoom in on my breasts, please?” Agatha asked with more than a little annoyance as Jen focused in on her client’s body and ignored everything about Rio.</p>
<p>“Hey, check Rio over too. No nips slipping. No drool.”</p>
<p>“Drool? Rude.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed beside her and Rio scowled, but looked back down again in time to see a zoomed in shot of Agatha’s face. She looked unreal. How could she look that good in a candid shot? But she looked up again and saw Agatha watching her closely and she raised her brows as she said: “You look good.”</p>
<p>Agatha fought a smirk and raised a brow at this, tilting her head as she surveyed Rio. “And you… are surprisingly shy about being touched when you fucked a girl on the beach.”</p>
<p>“Ooooohh,” Alice sang in amusement, looking between Agatha and Rio, all anger from the incident before clearly gone now she’d secured her client the photo of the century.</p>
<p>Rio narrowed her gaze at Agatha but saw no malice reflected back at her and only a smug smile on that annoyingly gorgeous face.</p>
<p>It infuriated her.</p>
<p>“Did Agatha Harkness just say ‘fuck’?” She asked with a smirk, and watched as Agatha narrowed her gaze further.</p>
<p>“Agatha, maybe you should start wearing your engagement ring,” Jen was saying, her phone zoomed back in on the hand over Rio’s stomach. “More sparkle.”</p>
<p>But Rio had turned around to be closer to Agatha and the older woman looked suddenly nervous, and a little surprised at the proximity again, but Rio didn’t leave her guessing for long.</p>
<p>In one, quick, strong, movement, she’d pushed Agatha into the deep end of the pool.</p>
<p>Two gasps rang out behind her and Rio laughed as Agatha resurfaced looking livid, throwing her wild her back over her head and practically growling at Rio on the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>“Rio! What the fuck!” Jen bellowed, as Alice slapped her hand over her mouth from beside her.</p>
<p>“Rio, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>Rio crouched down to get closer as Agatha moved towards the edge of the pool, ignoring the two behind her. “Sorry, I must have slipped.”</p>
<p>“You’re an ass,” Agatha accused just as she reached up and tugged Rio into the pool with her, both disappearing beneath the water for a few seconds before resurfacing with splutters of laughter.</p>
<p>It was the laughter that softened the reaction of the two people hired to be what they were both silently considering in that moment to be glorified babysitters to the two actresses now gasping for air and laughing in the water below them.</p>
<p>“She has an Oscar,” Jen said in disbelief as she watched her client throw a splash of water in Rio’s direction.</p>
<p>Alice only rolled her eyes and she took Jen’s hand, tugging her away to the kitchen, “Shame she’s straight. Think of what we could do together if <em>they</em> were together.”</p>
<p>“Rio wishes,” Jen muttered as the two disappeared into the villa.</p>
<p>In the pool Rio was laughing so hard she had to swim to the side and support herself with one hand, trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>“God. You weren’t supposed to pull me in!”</p>
<p>Agatha was treading water somewhere behind her and laughed, “Like I wouldn’t. You think I’d let you get away with trying to drown me? I have an Oscar!”</p>
<p>Rio laughed harder again and turned, twisting her wrist to keep herself up still on the side. “Yes, I’ve heard! Where is it? The bathroom? The bedroom?”</p>
<p>She wriggled her brows suggestively and Agatha scoffed and threw a wave of water Rio’s way.</p>
<p>“The <em>office</em>. My office.”</p>
<p>“No fun,” Rio accused with a grin reaching her other hand behind her to hold the wall too.</p>
<p>“And exactly why would an Oscar be fun in the bedroom?”</p>
<p>Rio shrugged a little, smiling still, “Remind your husband how powerful you are. Remind <em>yourself</em>.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need reminding,” Agatha said with a grin, moving over to mimic Rio’s hold on the wall.</p>
<p>“Maybe. Still. Something sexy about it.”</p>
<p>“Well maybe you can put yours in your bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, I think I have a while yet. This one’s yours.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed softly and pushed off the wall again, choosing to tread water in front of Rio instead, “Don’t be so sure.”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows, “Are you gonna vote for me?”</p>
<p>Agatha released a laugh and tilted her head back, exposing her neck to Rio which made her glance down at it and lose her train of thought for a second.</p>
<p>“How about this?” Agatha asked, catching Rio’s eye again with a smirk when she looked back across at her, “If I vote for you, and you win, you have to thank me first.”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and rolled her eyes, “Easy. Wanda will be a little pissed but-…”</p>
<p>“No, Rio Vidal, <em>first</em>. Before god, before your parents, everyone. Not just ‘your fellow nominees’.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed and poked her tongue into the side of her cheek, watching as Agatha’s eyes twinkled with mischief and something else she couldn’t name.</p>
<p>“On the very slim chance that I’m nominated and <em>win</em>, then yes. I’ll thank you first. Before anyone. Which might be hard to explain to my mom.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed and nodded, “Good. Then that’s one vote in your favour.”</p>
<p>“And what if you win?”</p>
<p>“What if I win?” Agatha asked with a grin, “<em>You</em> can’t vote. So if I win, you’ve done nothing to help me.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Rio sang out, kicking her feet out gently before her and stretching her body out near the surface of the water. Agatha’s gaze dropped along the length of her and she moved to the side, now only a foot or so away.</p>
<p>“That photo of us was gold. That’ll help you. <em>And</em> it’ll help your profile with the younger audiences.”</p>
<p>“Younger audiences?” Agatha gaped at Rio, reaching to grab the side so she could rest her arms and legs that were working to keep her afloat. “You know I’m not <em>that</em> much older than you?”</p>
<p>Rio brought her body back in to be back against the wall.</p>
<p>“Older, though. Old enough for me to make you seem <em>very</em> cool for hanging out with me.”</p>
<p>“That is so-…”</p>
<p>“So what?” Rio teased, finally understanding what Alice had meant. Relaxing more around Agatha was the way to go, it was the way to make all of this much easier.</p>
<p>She wasn’t just a girl with a crush on a movie star.</p>
<p>She was a movie star with a crush on a movie star.</p>
<p>Two very different things.</p>
<p>“I’ll have you know,” Agatha moved closer, her hand slipping below the water and resting on Rio’s side applying enough pressure that Rio knew she wanted her to turn her way.</p>
<p>“I’m seven years older. I looked it up. Both millennials. That’s barely an age difference.”</p>
<p>“It is in Hollywood,” Rio said with a smile, intensely aware that Agatha’s hand was still on her side as she turned to her.  “You could play my mom in my next movie.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s jaw dropped and she froze for a second, and Rio thought she’d gone too far suddenly, the beer and tequila blurring the lines in her mind.</p>
<p>But Agatha’s reaction, her true reaction hadn’t hit yet and an apology was on the tip of her tongue before Agatha repeated her move from earlier and found that soft spot between Rio’s ribs and waist and dug her fingers in so deep that Rio inhaled in shock as she folded in on herself.</p>
<p>She swallowed a mouthful of water and disappeared below the water line, dragging Agatha with her where she’d placed her forward-leaning body weight over her arm.</p>
<p>They wrestled and flailed beneath the water for a while until they both broke out, Rio coughing much more than Agatha and Agatha gasping as she struggled to keep them both afloat.</p>
<p>She managed to manhandle Rio to the edge of the pool, lifting her so her top half was out and her elbows could rest on the edge. Agatha panted softly behind her, one arm tight around Rio’s waist and her other holding herself at the wall by Rio’s side.</p>
<p>“That…” Rio gasped, too intent on catching her breath to focus on the fact that Agatha’s body was pressed behind her, her cheek and soft breaths against her naked back. “Was… mean.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed quietly and pulled her head away, pushing off a little only when she was sure Rio wouldn’t collapse back into the water.</p>
<p>Her hold around her middle loosened enough for Rio to be able to turn around and found herself trapped between Agatha’s arms holding the wall beside her head.</p>
<p>It was familiar, too familiar, only this time Rio wasn’t as drunk, wasn’t as awestruck, though she was close.</p>
<p>“You okay?” Agatha asked softly, the laughter fading from her lips as she watched Rio watch her.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rio said just as softly, her lungs still burning from the inhalation of pool water but her whole body more interested in the woman before her than its own salvation.</p>
<p>“You play dirty,” Rio accused and Agatha’s lips twitched slightly at the sides.</p>
<p>“Not bad for an old woman, huh?”</p>
<p>But Rio couldn’t give in to this blatant cheating and only scowled playfully, taking a shot and lifting her right hand to rest over Agatha’s left on the wall behind her, her wrist twisted uncomfortably. Just to be closer.</p>
<p>Just to see.</p>
<p>Agatha glanced at their hands and saw the extra strain Rio was putting herself under so pulled her hand away and dipped it below the water, her lower face slipping under until she got a good purchase, to tug at Rio’s thigh, her hand slipping to hold the back of her knee.</p>
<p>“Here. I’ll hold us.”</p>
<p>Rio only nodded and as loosely as she could she draped her legs around Agatha’s waist, careful not to press too close, moving her hands to rest lightly and demurely on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Being held up by Agatha in the pool was not how shed envisioned her evening going.</p>
<p>But her fingers had moved of their own accord, lightly toying with the straps of Agatha’s swimsuit. Her thighs were tense where she tried to get a hold of her own desire to press closer, and her gaze was determinedly focused on Agatha’s.</p>
<p>They were both silent for a time and Rio began to feel the awkwardness of the choice, her mind working overtime to establish it as friendly rather than flirty.</p>
<p>If Alice had done this, if Wanda or any other her other industry friends had done this, it wouldn’t have meant anything at all.</p>
<p>But something about Agatha’s frequent shifts in intensity, the way she was looking at her, the way Rio’s body reacted to her, it was different.</p>
<p>And she wasn’t sure Agatha would be comfortable with a photo of them like this on the internet, but she could count several other of her friends who wouldn’t mind at all.</p>
<p>She racked her brain with what to say, how to break the tension.</p>
<p>She couldn’t run away again, that at least wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>But what could she say that would make this seem normal, natural, and not result in Rio embarrassing herself once more in front of Agatha Harkness.</p>
<p>“Nicky,” she tried suddenly, “do you miss him?”</p>
<p>Agatha looked a little taken aback by this, she’d clearly been lost in her own thoughts too but she nodded and frowned a little, falling easily back into the conversation.</p>
<p>“All the time.”</p>
<p>And Rio shifted her hands, jumping them from Agatha’s shoulders to her neck, her fingers just touching the soft, wet hairs at the back of her neck.</p>
<p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge the move but her arms flexed and she pulled a little closer to the edge, and Rio had to assume it was to lessen the strain as she held them both above the water line.</p>
<p>But it meant that she’d pressed closer.</p>
<p>Rio swallowed and cleared her throat quietly, “Jen told Alice he was a good kid.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled just a little and whether real or imaginary Rio noticed her whole face softening.</p>
<p>“He’s the best. He’s shy but a real ham when he wants to be.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Rio laughed a little as she felt the tension ease somewhat.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Into everything. Basketball’s his first love though. Tries to get me to play all the time but-…”</p>
<p>“I’d play with him.”</p>
<p>The words came out before she could even think about it and Agatha looked taken aback again for a second before she schooled her face and simply raised her brows.</p>
<p>“You’d play basketball with my seven year old son?”</p>
<p>“I mean… he can’t be any worse than some of the guys down the park.”</p>
<p>This seemed to give Agatha even more pause and she tilted her head to the side as she surveyed Rio closely, “You play? In the park?”</p>
<p>“When I can. I used to have a team but… work makes that harder.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded slowly, apparently thinking it over for a second, “Maybe we can set up a date? Schedules are crazy right now but… I wouldn’t mind introducing you to Nicky if you wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>Rio cursed herself for getting herself into this position, literally and figuratively, but Agatha was offering another olive branch and who was Rio to say no.</p>
<p>“I’d like that.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled softly and Rio’s gaze dropped to it, her cheeks flushing once more at just how close she was to Agatha.</p>
<p>It made her feel insane, made her feel like she was drunk again, misunderstanding things once more.</p>
<p>But had Agatha leant in a little? Had she parted her lips?</p>
<p>“Agatha! Drinks on the terrace!”</p>
<p>The moment was broken and Agatha had pulled away so suddenly that Rio almost dropped below the waterline again.</p>
<p>Her saviour was once again Agatha, who’d caught her waist and kept her buoyant but released as soon as Rio managed to grasp the wall.</p>
<p>They looked at each other but neither said anything as Agatha moved away and swam back to the shallow end of the pool.</p>
<p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath, watching as Agatha climbed the shallow steps to get out.</p>
<p>This crush was crushing. Agatha would be the death of her. And not even an Oscar at the end of it could bring her back to life.</p>

<p>When Rio finally followed Agatha out of the pool, she was relieved to see that she’d left her alone to dry herself by the sunbeds.</p><p>She picked up the fluffy towel left for her and wrapped it tightly around her wet body, watching as Agatha retreated to the veranda where Alice and Jen now sat with their drinks before them.</p><p>She was sure she hadn’t imagined Agatha had leant in but then… surely not.</p><p>Deciding now wasn’t the time to dwell once again on her tragic crush on Agatha Harkness, she padded on over to join the group, taking the vacant seat beside Agatha.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her briefly as she reached for her spritz but said nothing that would indicate how close they’d just been in the pool, nothing that would suggest she thought they’d had a moment that was more than friendly.</p><p>“I think we should all quit and just move here,” Jen said with a smile, relaxed back in her seat and cradling her spritz in both hands.</p><p>“Learn italian, eat gelato everyday, spritzes every evening.”</p><p>“I could get onboard,’ Alice said with a smile, nudging Rio under the table with her foot, “Rio? Time to settle down?”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure we’d all kill each other after a week. Two days is enough.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio and raised her brows, “Sick of us already?”</p><p>“Some of you,” Rio smiled a little, taking a well-timed sip of her spritz as she watched Agatha smirk across at her.</p><p>Maybe they were just becoming friends, feeling each other out, seeing how the other ticked.</p><p>Rio could handle that.</p><p>She was an adult. She could handle an unrequited crush.</p><p>Besides, she thought idly as she took another sip of her drink through the metal straw, who didn’t want a friend who was nice to look at?</p><p>“Let’s hope we’re not preventing you from meeting any more signoras on the beach, Rio. Far be it for us to stop you,” Jen said with a smirk that made Rio turn to her with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>“Actually I’m pretty exhausted from last night so… I think I’ll just hang with you guys, if that’s alright with you?”</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat beside her but Rio didn’t have a chance to look her way as Jen laughed and said: “How you get away with it, I don’t know.”</p><p>“I’m charming,” Rio grinned brightly, and Jen rolled her eyes but smiled across at her, softening a little.</p><p>“Just don’t be too charming, okay? We’re getting that Oscar.”</p><p>“Actually, about that…” Rio leant in slightly and Agatha realised what she was about to do and leant forward too, angling herself towards Rio and holding her arm.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, I swear to <em>god</em>.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to Agatha in surprise, and Agatha narrowed her eyes at her which Rio took as a dare and she said what Agatha feared she was going to as she stared into narrowed blue eyes: “Agatha’s going to vote for me.”</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha. You <em>cannot</em> vote for the competition.”</p><p>“Technically,” Agatha drawled out, slowly turning away her narrowed glare at a grinning Rio to look at her best friend, “everyone’s the competition.”</p><p>“But <em>Rio</em> is the favourite. After you, of course. Which is why you vote for yourself.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha squeeze her bicep softly and she glanced at her, watching as she settled back into her seat and pulled her hand away, “Hey, I’m just helping the younger generation out.”</p><p>She knew that was a dig. A gentle prod at Rio for calling her old earlier.</p><p>She scoffed and fought the butterflies that fluttered in her stomach at the idea that she had an inside joke with Agatha. Ridiculous, she thought to herself.</p><p>“Younger gen-…?!” Jen started up suddenly, because if Rio were in a younger generation compared to Agatha then the same could be said for her and Alice.</p><p>And she didn’t like the insinuation.</p><p>“Baby,” Alice said and Rio’s brows shot up as she watched her friend practically paw at Jen’s arm to soothe her, “I think it’s hot you’re a little older.”</p><p>“I-…” Jen turned to Alice with a furious expression that she couldn’t keep up for longer than two seconds and soon shut her mouth, relaxing slowly back down again.</p><p>“Whatever. Not that much older.”</p><p>“Old enough,” Alice said with a wide smile that was so infectious even Rio picked it up when it wasn’t aimed at her.</p><p>She nudged Alice gently beneath the table, making her turn to her and catch her eye. She wanted to tell her how happy she was for her, but it would be too mawkish to say out loud. So she simply wriggled her brows and shot her a wink, knowing she’d understand what she was trying to say.</p><p>“How long have you guys known each other?” Agatha asked suddenly, watching the interaction between them with interest.</p><p>“College,” Rio said with a smile, “We were assigned each other as roommates. Alice fell in love with my mother’s cooking and I’ve been unable to shake her since.”</p><p>“Empanadas to die for, tostones you’d crawl over hot coals for,” Alice clarified with a smile, “But honestly she can turn her hand to anything. Shame Rio never picked up her skill.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m not bad.”</p><p>“Not great either.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and took a sip of her drink but almost choked on it when Agatha asked her next question: “Have you ever…?”</p><p>“God! No. No. Definitely-…” Rio began, spluttering a little.</p><p>“Ouch, Vidal,” Alice said in faux-offence, placing a hand over her heart, “Let a girl down easy.”</p><p>“Oh you’d rather die than touch me, you know it.”</p><p>“True. Something… gross about it. Makes me feel a bit sick.”</p><p>“Ah thanks.”</p><p>Jen scoffed and reached an arm over to pull Alice a bit closer in a display of possessiveness that Alice responded to with a smirk and Rio watched with a slight pang of jealousy.</p><p>No one was jealous over her.</p><p>But she fought it off, turning to Agatha who was watching this move closely too.</p><p>“No, we haven’t. Never was even a thought. I came out long before Alice anyway.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Yeah, I got caught making out with my girlfriend by my mom when I was around sixteen so have been out since then and Alice-…”</p><p>But Agatha interrupted, clearly more interested in Rio than in Alice’s story: “How did your mom take it?”</p><p>“Totally fine. She said she knew and to be honest I think she walked in on purpose to try to force me to tell her.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and Rio’s brow furrowed slightly as she thought she caught something wistful in her gaze, but it was gone as Alice spoke across from them.</p><p>“I didn’t come out until I was in my early twenties. Rio knew earlier, obviously. Coached me through a lot of it. Helped with all the feelings and… confusion and… yeah, just took me a little longer.”</p><p>“Not me,” Jen said with a grin, “Came out the womb gay as the day is long. My parents knew by the time I was about five, I think. Never touched a man in my life, thank god.”</p><p>“Me neither,” Alice grimaced and Rio laughed at her as she did.</p><p>“Have you?” Agatha asked softly, turning again to look at Rio when her laughter had died down. Rio just shrugged and took a sip of her drink before answering.</p><p>“Yeah. There was a time in college I was experimenting… I wanted to see if I could be with a man that way. The thought didn’t disgust me totally like it did Alice so I slept with a couple guys but it wasn’t for me.”</p><p>This was putting it lightly.</p><p>The first time Rio had slept with a man she’d taken three hot showers in quick succession to try to wash the memory away, horrified with his clammy touches and frequent grunts.</p><p>The second time had been different but mostly because Rio had been off her face drunk and so had the man. They’d had a very clumsy fumble and Rio had experienced for the first time what it was to be in a situation where she felt no sexual attraction whatsoever even with his fingers inside her.</p><p>She’d pushed him away after two thrusts and stumbled her way home to crawl into bed beside Alice, reeking of beer and Paco Rabanne.</p><p>“Have you ever been with a woman?” Alice asked innocently over at Agatha and Rio watched Agatha’s reaction curiously, seeing her posture change ever so slightly and her jaw flexing a little.</p><p>“No, not for me.”</p><p>Agatha was saved from expanding her answer by Jen who had interjected with an amused smirk in her best friend’s direction.</p><p>“Agatha’s only ever slept with two guys anyway.”</p><p>“What?” Alice asked suddenly, totally shocked by this delicious nugget of information.</p><p>“No way,” Rio added, unable to help herself as she stared wide-eyed across at Agatha. “But… but you look like <em>that</em>. How have you only slept with two people?”</p><p>Agatha huffed and ran a hand through her hair, avoiding Rio’s eye contact and instead focusing on Jen.</p><p>“Thank you for that, Jennifer.”</p><p>“You’re very welcome, Agatha.”</p><p>“I… had a high school boyfriend and then I met my husband. That’s all.”</p><p>Rio blinked owlishly at what she could see now of Agatha’s side profile and remained silent as she tried to process this idea.</p><p>Two men. Two lucky sons of bitches had been deemed worthy enough to bed Agatha.</p><p>In a strange way it made sense. Agatha was better than mere mortals, especially better than male mortals. So it was right that only two of them had ever been able to take her to bed.</p><p>But still, she couldn’t help but think what a waste it was.</p><p>And how she wouldn’t mind being the third lucky son of a bitch.</p><p>“Agatha’s mom,” Jen started again but Agatha was quicker this time, her tone much sharper than it had been when she was trying to prevent Rio from sharing her voting intentions.</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>.”</p><p>“What?” Jen asked with faux innocence, smiling widely across at Agatha, “I think most of the world knows already anyway. She’s one of the largest Republican Party donors there is.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and her gaze dropped to her spritz and Rio watched as she began spinning it with her straw, clearly unimpressed with where this conversation had gone.</p><p>She felt a little sorry for her but said nothing and turned to focus in on Jen who looked like she was gearing up to tell an exciting tale.</p><p>“Evanora basically kept Agatha on a leash until she was old enough to leave home. Still would like to keep that leash tight, in fact. A real piece of work, that woman.”</p><p>Agatha shifted and Rio looked back to her, watching as she placed her glass down and began spinning her wedding ring with her left thumb instead.</p><p>“She’s not exactly ever going to win mother of the year and well, Agatha married young because-…”</p><p>“Enough,” Agatha said just as sharply as before and Rio’s eyes darted across to Alice who had flinched at her words.</p><p>Jen sighed heavily, “I’m just explaining why you’re a massive loser who’s only slept with-…”</p><p>“Jen,” Rio said quickly before even Agatha could interject, “You’re being incredibly quiet about your sex life. So go ahead: how many notches on your broomstick?”</p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes at Rio at the insult but Rio didn’t care, she’d felt a strange flare up of protectiveness for the woman beside her and as Jen huffed a bit as she answered she felt Agatha shift her position to turn more to her and the gentle graze of her fingers against her towel-covered leg.</p><p>She was thanking her.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly but kept her gaze on Jennifer.</p><p>“Admittedly, I don’t have <em>that</em> many stories to tell. But… I always did okay for myself.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, not interested enough to push for more details now she’d derailed the Agatha bashing. She settled back in her seat and took another sip of her drink.</p><p>Jen must have known the conversation had died because she didn’t say anything else for a while and the table descended into silence.</p><p>But soon Alice spoke: “Maybe we <em>would</em> all kill each other in a week.”</p><p>Rio laughed and placed her empty glass down on the table.</p><p>“I told you.”</p><p>She stood, pushing her chair back as she did.</p><p>“More aperols? Wine? Beer? Are we just going to order in a pizza or something?”</p><p>Alice nodded and held her own empty glass to Rio, “Wine is good for me.”</p><p>“Me too,” Jen said, but Rio noticed that she didn’t offer her glass up.</p><p>Agatha reached for it instead and stood with Rio, “I’ll help.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and scooped her own glass up before moving through to the kitchen to discard the old and take the new.</p><p>She crouched down at the wine fridge and began pulling out bottles, inspecting labels as she went.</p><p>Agatha was emptying out the finished aperol glasses in the sink and they sat in a companionable silence for a while as Rio continued to focus her efforts on picking the wine.</p><p>White and dry was her preferred choice but all the labels were in Italian so she had to rely on the hopes that Italian and Spanish weren’t <em>that</em> different.</p><p>“When you slept with those men,” Agatha asked suddenly, just as Rio had pulled out her fourth bottle to inspect. “What did it feel like?”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, halfway through translating <em>’vine piano fresco proveniente dalle verdi colline toscane’</em> in her own mind. She paused, making sure she’d heard Agatha right and then stood slowly, moving to close the door to the wine fridge as she moved closer, “What?”</p><p>“How did you know?”</p><p>Agatha had turned her head towards her where she stood at the sink but kept her body facing forwards, her fingers curled around the edge of the basin.</p><p>“I mean, it was pretty obvious,” Rio said with a smile, trying to break the tension a little. “If you’re attracted to someone… you just know.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed a little and she turned away again, reaching to lift each glass out to place upside down on the side. “Right.”</p><p>Rio chewed the inside of her cheek in thought for a second and decided to be bold.</p><p>She placed the bottle of wine down and reached for Agatha, turning her around to face her.</p><p>“I felt horrible when both of those men were touching me. It wasn’t something I had to think about. My body just told me.”</p><p>She’d placed her hands on Agatha’s arms, squeezing them gently and tilting her head as Agatha kept her gaze away, lost in her own mind despite Rio’s attempts to bring her back to the surface again.</p><p>“But hey,” Rio said, softening her tone slightly, “If this is about having not slept with many people… then you should know that actually I envy you for that.”</p><p><em>Your husband, more like</em>, Rio clarified in her head.</p><p>And Agatha looked around at her suddenly and Rio smiled a little where she saw confusion in her face.</p><p>“You get to go home every night to someone who loves you and… I’m still picking girls up in bars or matching with them on Raya.” Rio shrugged and cleared her throat quickly, finding that saying it out loud actually felt worse than keeping it in.</p><p>Suddenly where she’d been trying to reassure Agatha, she felt like she needed the reassurance.</p><p>She moved away, swiping the bottle back and ducking back down quickly to the wine fridge that she’d opened again and hidden her face inside of.</p><p>“Anyway.”</p><p>Agatha remained standing by the sink and Rio now regretted being so honest, exposing herself in that way.</p><p>Agatha had probably only asked because she couldn’t imagine a world where someone <em>wasn’t</em> attracted to her handsome Ken doll of a husband.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio jumped a little, Agatha’s voice soft and just behind her now, a warm hand resting on her arm where she was still riffling through the wine options to find the right one.</p><p>She turned back and saw that Agatha had moved to be kneeling down just beside her, and looked nervous, her gaze heavy with emotions Rio couldn’t decipher.</p><p>But the hand on her arm had moved to cradle her cheek and Rio found herself leaning into the touch just a little, unsure what she should say.</p><p>Agatha took a breath and then said in the softest tone Rio had ever heard from her as her thumb delicately caressed her cheekbone, “One day, you will meet the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with.”</p><p>She paused as Rio’s breath hitched and she felt her eyes suddenly sting with the promise of tears.</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes darted cautiously over Rio’s face and she saw in them a tenderness that had become more common the more time she spent with her.</p><p>She wondered if this was the kind of privileged look Nicky and Ralph would get from her, safe in their home, living a life with Agatha unavailable to Rio.</p><p>“And she,” Agatha continued just as softly, “will be the luckiest woman alive.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath and saw Agatha’s eyes fall to her lips.</p><p>From outside, Rio heard Jen ask what was taking so long but it was immaterial to her.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness was kneeling before her and looking at her with what Rio could only describe now as <em>aching</em> and she felt like she couldn’t breathe.</p><p><em>You</em>, she wanted to say as Agatha gently wiped her tear away with the pad of her thumb, <em>let it be you. I want it to be you.</em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, just as Agatha’s thumb continued its movements against her cheek, her blue eyes as glassy now as Rio’s must have been.</p><p>But there was movement over Agatha’s shoulder and Rio looked up to see Jen marching towards them. She pulled away suddenly, mortified that she would be caught kneeling down before Agatha and crying in front of a wine fridge.</p><p>She busied herself with grabbing another bottle of wine, not even bothering to check the label.</p><p>“What the fuck is taking so long? You squeezing the grapes yourselves?”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha huff and stand behind her. She shot Jen an unamused look and went to grab four fresh glasses.</p><p>“We were checking the labels, your highness. They’re all in Italian.”</p><p>“So?” Jen asked with raised brows, “Rio’s Spanish.”</p><p>“I’m not Spanish, I <em>speak</em> Spanish and they’re different languages,” Rio clarified quickly as she stood to shut the door, satisfied that she at least wouldn’t be crying again any time soon.</p><p>“Whatever, you know what I mean.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and avoided looking at Agatha as she went to grab a frozen wine sleeve from the freezer, slotting it on the bottle and taking the corkscrew with her as she followed the other two back out.</p><p>She placed the wine on the table and stood at the end of it, vaguely aware that Jen was now talking about Agatha’s next project. She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her but she didn’t look up and focused instead on getting the cork out and the wine poured.</p><p>When she was done, she made a quick excuse for herself and disappeared back into the house to hide in her bedroom for a few minutes under the pretence of changing out of her towel and damp bikini.</p><p>No one came to find her.</p><p>She allowed herself just ten minutes to collect herself, well aware that if she gave herself any longer that Alice might comes searching, or else, and absolute worst case scenario: Agatha would.</p><p>But she couldn’t dwell in her feelings either.</p><p>If she took the time to fully sit in them, to analyse and dissect them, she would be in for a world of trouble.</p><p>For now, a surface-level look at them would have to do.</p><p>She had the rest of the night and a plane ride back to get through still.</p><p>Rio had a crush. Agatha liked Rio. Rio sometimes thought Agatha might like like Rio. Agatha was happily married.</p><p>The math was simple. The people were not.</p><p>So she soon returned back to the little group and found them all to be at least halfway through their wines, where Rio’s sat untouched in front of her seat.</p><p>Agatha glanced up as she came through and Rio managed to send a small smile her way before she took her seat.</p><p>“I should change too,” Agatha said softly, disappearing off to the place Rio had just emerged from.</p><p>Alice shot Rio a quick ‘are you okay?’ look and Rio simply nodded with an easy smile. She had to just get through the next few hours and then she’d be fine.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t have a hold on her when she was back at work, back doing press, back in her normal life.</p><p>Everyone knew vacations were rife for confusing feelings and ill-fated romances that would mean nothing when you were back home.</p><p>That’s all this was.</p><p>Only Rio wasn’t getting any of the benefits that might come from an ill-fated romance because the subject of her infatuation was straight.</p><p>By the time Agatha was back at the table, Rio had managed to calm her racing heart and the conversation flowed as well as it had earlier.</p><p>But with conversation flowing so was alcohol and the little table in the little villa tucked away on the hillside of Positano’s infamous bay became rowdier.</p><p>“Would you just let me finish?” Jen was shouting across at Agatha, who had long since given up on sitting properly at the table and was now lounging back, her arms suddenly flung in the air.</p><p>“Go ahead,” she announced with aplomb. “Be my guest.”</p><p>Jen huffed and pulled the shawl Alice had fetched for her earlier tighter around her shoulders in the chill of the late evening. “<em>Agatha</em> would have won all <em>three</em> Oscars by now if she were just willing to play the game a little more.”</p><p>“I don’t need to play when I have the goods already.”</p><p>“Incorrect, Agatha! You only have <em>one</em> Oscar!”</p><p>Rio grimaced dramatically for the sake of Alice opposite her who was staring at her with wide eyes and she made her laugh which made both Jen and Agatha round on her immediately: “What?”</p><p>Alice flinched and looked to Rio for help where Rio just began to laugh.</p><p>Agatha huffed heavily, stealing her wine glass from the table before she leant back again, tucking her feet beneath herself.</p><p>“Calderu won because her movie was about the Holocaust so <em>obviously</em>. A nun saving kids from the gestapo? Who could compete?! Then-…”</p><p>But Jen had cut her off again and Rio, though she’d witnessed this dynamic since they’d all first met in Cannes, was starting to really enjoy it.</p><p>“Don’t give me that shit, Agatha. <em>You</em> pissed off the director’s branch because you-…”</p><p>“Because I called out a bad working environment and an abuse of power,” Agatha countered and Rio raised her brows at Jen, wondering how she’d work her way around this one.</p><p>But she didn’t. She just shrugged and turned her face away, taking a measured sip of her drink.</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and mirrored Jen’s movements, taking a large sip of her own drink.</p><p>“Need I remind you that <em>you</em> encouraged me to call out the behaviour?”</p><p>“I said whatever,” Jen muttered, clearly caught and clearly not interested in continuing this conversation.</p><p>“You told me to do it when it was just rumours and so I-…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, alright. I lost you the Oscar. Are you happy now?”</p><p>And to Rio, Agatha did look happy. She looked more than happy. She looked smug, incredibly so.</p><p>“Thrilled, thank you.”</p><p>“I think the win here is the behaviour being called out,” Rio said with more than a hint of amusement in her voice, and just to add to it, she stole Agatha’s wine glass from her hand and drank from it, there being no other wine left on the table.</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha said with a scowl, turning to try and snatch her wine back.</p><p>Rio just held it away, holding her right arm out to the side so Agatha couldn’t get it without physically moving.</p><p>“You’re a child,” she accused and Rio beamed at her in response, amused at how Agatha could be so furious but still look so ridiculously hot.</p><p>“There’s no wine left. No queda vino.” She offered as an excuse.</p><p>“Give me my <em>wine</em>.”</p><p>Agatha looked serious and Rio only grinned still, raising her brows at the determination writ large across her features.</p><p>“Oh? This wine?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal. ¡Dámelo!”</p><p>Rio blinked and forgot the game suddenly so pulled the wine back around and held it between them, only remembering what she’d been trying to do when Agatha put her hand around the glass she still held, their fingers overlapping where Agatha’s dominate hand was her left and Rio’s her right.</p><p>“¿Tú hablas español?”</p><p>“Obviamente.”</p><p>Rio saw Agatha’s gaze drop down to their joined hands and blinked slowly, her brain taking a while to catch up to what was going on.</p><p>But Alice was their saviour.</p><p>“Holy shit. Have you seen how many likes we got? Rio this is more than the last two posts combined.”</p><p>Agatha looked up and raised her brows and released her hold on the wine glass so Rio could take it back.</p><p>She hesitated for a second before she placed it down before Agatha and leant her other hand up on the back of Agatha’s chair as she turned to Alice.</p><p>“How many?”</p><p>Alice was frowning down at what Rio guessed must be her Instagram page and Rio raised her brows expectantly, vaguely aware that as Jen leant across to look over Alice’s shoulder, Agatha was drinking what was left of the wine.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Jen said quietly, making Rio feel even more impatient that no one was answering.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said softly, and Rio was aware suddenly that where she’d leant over to place her hand on Agatha’s chair, she was now closer to her.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand on her leg.</p><p>“I think I just bought you another two million on your asking price with that post.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but turned to look at Agatha and found she couldn’t think of a witty retort. Agatha’s eyes were heavy, her gaze a little bleary, her hand still warm and soft against the skin of just above her knee.</p><p>“Rio. It’s almost a million.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, tearing her gaze away from Agatha to look round at Alice, unsure she’d heard her correctly. “What?”</p><p>“Almost a million.”</p><p>“Give it to me.”</p><p>Rio scooched her chair closer and held her hand out to Alice.</p><p>She felt the loss immediately of Agatha’s hand as it fell from her leg.</p><p>But Alice had handed her phone over and suddenly Agatha was close again as she leant across and Rio stared wide-eyed at the image of her and Agatha from only four hours ago, and the little number below it that confirmed Alice’s announcement.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything as she looked down at the screen and Rio felt incapacitated for a while, staring at the attention the photo was getting.</p><p>She slowly raised her gaze to look across at Alice who looked positively horrified at the numbers it was doing.</p><p>“I can’t believe it.”</p><p>“Why not?” Jen asked with a wave of her hand and a shrug, “You are so welcome, by the way. But don’t get used to it. That’s the last time you’re using Agatha like that.”</p><p>“Do you understand how good this could be for both of us?” Alice asked suddenly, stealing the phone back from Rio and holding it up to Jen’s face.</p><p>“Rio’s already a hit online and Agatha… well. She’s a hit everywhere but. But Rio could help.”</p><p>Rio sniggered and went to steal Agatha’s wine glass and frowned where she’d forgotten Agatha had finished her wine already.</p><p>“Too slow,” Agatha said with a grin and swiped her glass back.</p><p>“Rude.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and rolled her eyes but Rio caught a slight softening in them and she turned quickly, feeling the need to have a replacement for the wine that was now missing.</p><p>“I’m gonna,” she started as she stood up, “more drinks.”</p><p>“I’ll help!” Alice shouted quickly, standing up to follow Rio eagerly into the kitchen and taking her sleeve in her hand, “Rio. What the fuck. How did this happen? We’re in fucking Italy and I have a girlfriend and you have… an Agatha.”</p><p>Rio laughed and wished she indeed had “an Agatha.”</p><p>But she’d take what she could get for now.</p><p>And what she currently had was a very pretty, reasonably drunk, friend who liked to touch her leg and share her smiles with her.</p><p>That could be enough.</p><p>“Did we just become <em>famous</em>?” She asked with a grin, sticking her tongue between her teeth as she went to raid the bar.</p><p>Alice laughed happily and grabbed more glasses, narrowly avoiding smashing any of them as she did so.</p><p>“We should take vacations more often.”</p><p>“Shall we just move here? Stay here forever?”</p><p>“I’ll ask Jen.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes but the reminder of Jen being asked meant that Agatha would be asked too and… Agatha had Ralph. And a son.</p><p>She shook the feeling off.</p><p>Decided that there was nothing she could do so she’d just <em>have</em> to enjoy what she had access to currently.</p><p>They soon had made up the strongest gin and tonics known to man and sauntered back out with them, Rio adding a flourish as she delivered Agatha’s drink to her.</p><p>“M’lady.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but stroked down Rio’s arm as she went to take her seat beside her again.</p><p>Rio decided she liked drunk Agatha.</p><p>She touched her more than regular Agatha.</p><p>But Jen’s spluttering as she sipped the strongest G&amp;T in the world made Rio look to her with raised brows and Alice begin slapping her back helpfully.</p><p>“You okay, princess?”</p><p>Agatha laughed as Jen continued to cough, “Don’t… Call me… That.”</p><p>Rio hummed in amusement and then took a tentative sip of her own drink, sinking back down in her seat and grimacing a little at just how strong it was.</p><p>“Can’t handle it?” Agatha asked with an amused smile in her direction, having not yet touched her own drink.</p><p>“Oh, just taking my time, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and raised two fingers to tap the underside of Rio’s glass, indicating she should keep drinking.</p><p>“You made it. You should drink it.”</p><p>“Are you trying to get me drunk?”</p><p>“Would I need to?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but found it suddenly dry and herself unable to form any coherent response.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was flirting with her.</p><p>No… Agatha Harkness was telling her she knew she had a crush. She was letting Rio know that she hadn’t acted her way out of this one.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>But Agatha’s fingers were still on the bottom of Rio’s glass and she pushed it up slowly, watching until Rio allowed it to hit her lips.</p><p>It was the sexiest thing that had ever happened to Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s chin was lifting slightly with the rising glass and her lips parted, her blue eyes never leaving Rio’s deep brown.</p><p>So Rio had no choice but to drink the lethal drink in one go, intent on keeping Agatha’s hypnotic blue eyes on her for as long as possible.</p><p>Alice whooped across the table and Jen frowned at the sight, shaking her head in disgust.</p><p>But Rio was showing off for her crush, and when she placed her now empty glass down she closed her eyes, focusing on not vomiting now that she’d achieved her goal.</p><p>But it had been worth it just to see Agatha looking at her like that.</p><p>The noise around her felt tinny all of a sudden, distant in a way that Rio couldn’t quite comprehend.</p><p>But then something came into focus that was loud, or at least loud to Rio’s ears.</p><p>A whisper close by, a hand on her upper thigh.</p><p>“Drink mine too and I’ll love you forever.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed open, unsure she’d heard correctly. Unsure she’d understood what she was being told.</p><p>But she couldn’t focus on the words because Agatha was close, so close she could see the little smattering of freckles across her cheeks, the green in her eyes again, and the way her lips parted in a teasing smile.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and watched as Agatha moved back to pass her her drink and she didn’t even think as she made to drink it down, just as she had her own.</p><p>“No, Rio, my god!” Jen shouted in horror as Alice cackled at her side.</p><p>But Agatha was smiling at her, tilting her head as she watched her and Rio had to do it. She had to just finish this glass, just put it down, just not spew it back up and Agatha would love her. Forever.</p><p>And she did. She placed it down harder than she meant to and she felt the gin repeat on her as she did.</p><p>But she held it together.</p><p>And she grinned lopsidedly at Agatha who was beaming back and laughing quietly, her whole body leaning towards Rio and both hands now on her thighs as she used her for balance and leant in to kiss her cheek.</p><p>The kiss was soft, more nose than lips as Agatha slipped slightly but Rio didn’t mind.</p><p>She’d take that kind of kiss from Agatha Harkness any day.</p><p>When Agatha leant back her hands were still on her legs and Rio felt hot below her gaze, but then again maybe it was the gin she’d just swallowed down.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, my hero.”</p><p>The words shot right down in between Rio’s thighs and she gaped a little stupidly up at Agatha, trying to focus in where her brain was trying not to make two of the most beautiful woman she’d ever seen.</p><p>But that was difficult with how drunk she felt.</p><p>Blue eyes flashed down to her parted lips and for a second Rio felt like throwing caution to the wind and closing the gap between them but Agatha had already pulled away and Rio was able to breathe again.</p><p>“More drinks!” Alice announced, waving her empty glass in the air where she sat, having clearly copied Rio in knocking back her own and Jen’s.</p><p>“Well considering I didn’t get mine, that would be nice,” Agatha said with a hint of a smirk and a wink in Rio’s direction.</p><p>Rio scowled playfully at her and poked her shoulder now she was sat oh so far away in her own chair.</p><p>“You told me to drink yours.”</p><p>“Well perhaps if you hadn’t made them so strong I wouldn’t have.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, still trying to figure out how Agatha’s brain worked.</p><p>She liked to tease her, she knew that much.</p><p>“Get it yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped a little and suddenly Rio didn’t know if she were teasing or not as she smiled widely, her hand coming up to her chest in a dramatic movement.</p><p>“Moi? Little old me get my own drink?”</p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and stood from her seat, offering a hand down to Rio unexpectedly. “You can at least come and help.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but who was she to deny Agatha for a second time so she took her offered hand and followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>In the cool of the air conditioning she shivered slightly and went to rest against the counter as Agatha dropped her hand and moved about the place looking for superior alternatives to Rio’s lethal G&amp;Ts.</p><p>“I can’t believe I drank both of those.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you did either.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rocked her head back, staring up at the ceiling as she fought off the threatening spin of the room.</p><p>“You’re a bad influence.”</p><p>“And you are going to have an almighty hangover tomorrow,” Agatha accused, a little closer than she’d been before.</p><p>Rio tilted her head back and raised her brows at her, seeing that she had in fact moved closer, her hand now next to hers on the counter.</p><p>“Your fault.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and bit the corner of her lip, “You’re a fun drunk.”</p><p>“Fun?”</p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>Rio felt her already warm cheeks heat up slightly and she wondered idly if Agatha were doing this on purpose; doing everything in her power to get her to blush, or suddenly feel like jelly in front of her.</p><p>“So?” Rio asked quietly, trying to pick back up some of the bravado she’d had whilst drinking two drinks in quick succession to impress a girl.</p><p>“So what?” Agatha asked in amusement, her fingers reaching out to just brush across Rio’s nails.</p><p>“Do you love me forever now?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised in surprise and she stepped in, raising her free hand to cup Rio’s cheek as she said in a gentle voice, “Yes, Rio Vidal. I love you forever.”</p><p>Rio knew she was placating her, toying with the sensitive emotions of a drunk woman, but it felt nice to be held this way by Agatha, to have her looking at her like that, to hear her say her name, to hear her say she loved her.</p><p>But Agatha’s thumb brushed her cheek just once and then she pulled away, and Rio reacted before she could think, she grabbed the hand on the counter and she swung her other round to pull Agatha to her, catching her in a tight but one-armed hug.</p><p>“Sorry,” she mumbled into still slightly damp brown hair, “can’t just say that and move away.”</p><p>Agatha released a breathy laugh against her and she squeezed Rio’s hand before she released it and wrapped both her arms around her. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as Agatha squeezed her middle and she thought she imagined it for a second but Agatha had turned her head slightly and had nuzzled in by her ear.</p><p>Her stomach flipped for reasons other than the gin and she felt herself suck in a sharp breath, and the arms around her squeezed her before they loosened and Agatha pulled back slowly, holding Rio still where she leant away from her.</p><p>Blue eyes were still hooded from the alcohol and the long day spent in the sun and Rio moved her hand to hold Agatha’s cheek, watching her watch her with a slight furrow in her brow.</p><p>“I should,” Agatha breathed out, turning her head a little so her parted lips grazed the heel of Rio’s palm before she pulled away entirely and cleared her throat, “I should get you water.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only feel the loss of Agatha from her arms and the ache of something she couldn’t name in her chest.</p><p>But she turned away and leant back against the sink, focusing on the soft noises of a glass being taken from the cupboard, the door closing, Agatha moving over, the water running, the glass being filled.</p><p>Agatha pressed the glass to Rio’s arm and Rio opened her eyes slowly to take it, quickly drinking down the water to try to keep the queasiness at bay.</p><p>Agatha had moved away, fetching other drinks for the group and by the time Rio had finished her water and taken a few deep breaths, she felt a little more confident that she wouldn’t be tasting that gin again.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re here.”</p><p>If the words took Agatha by surprise they took Rio by surprise too.</p><p>She hadn’t planned on saying them.</p><p>But clearly drunk mouths speak sober truths.</p><p>Agatha paused where’d she’d been filling a glass with ice.</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“Mmhm.</p><p>“Because we definitely gatecrashed and you didn’t look much like you wanted us here.”</p><p>Rio tried to fight her smile but lost. “I’m better when there’s a camera pointed at me.”</p><p>“What changed your mind?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and tried to act nonchalant as she ran a hand through her hair, “Maybe the gin?”</p><p>Agatha smirked and turned back around to continue making the drinks, “Well I’m using vodka now so let’s hope your opinion doesn’t change again.”</p><p>“Never.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over her shoulder and Rio sent a clumsy wink her way which made Agatha laugh.</p><p><em>Nailed it</em>, Rio thought, beginning to hum quietly where she waited patiently for the drinks to be made.</p><p>Soon enough Agatha was pressing one into her hand and smiling as she held her own up to cheers.</p><p>“To ruined vacations?”</p><p>“To thanking you first in my Oscar speech.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to Agatha’s smirk and she was so distracted that she forgot to take a sip of her drink. It took Agatha nudging her glass gently with her hand for Rio to come back to herself again and raise the glass to her lips.</p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to be some hotshot lothario?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio asked softly, swallowing down a small mouthful of limey vodka soda. Even in her drunken state she knew she needed to slow down a little.</p><p>“I’m not sure you have any game.”</p><p>Rio could only laugh at this insult and raised her brows at Agatha, swaying a little when she leant in slightly, “Why’s that?”</p><p>“Just a lil goofy.”</p><p>“Goofy?!” Rio demanded with a look of faux shock but whatever she was planning on saying next was lost in her own mind as Jen appeared back in the villa.</p><p>“Why do you two take so damn long?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, in spite of herself she smiled goofily over at Jennifer and Agatha laughed as she moved to pick up Jen’s drink from the side.</p><p>“Rio was just telling me how <em>pleased</em> she was that we are here.”</p><p>“Agatha was just insulting me,” Rio added with a playful glare at the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Riiiiight,” Jen said slowly, accepting her drink from Agatha and watching the two other women closely. “Well the party’s outside so if you wouldn’t mind joining us?”</p><p>Rio only nodded and pushed herself off the counter to begin striding out to the terrace again, missing the look exchanged between Jen and Agatha. Jen looked confused and Agatha just smiled as she walked past, focusing on following Rio.</p><p>“You took aaaaages,” Alice sang as Rio arrived back at the table.</p><p>“Making drinks is hard work,” Rio shrugged as she sat down a little heavier than she meant to in her chair and took another small sip of her drink.</p><p>Jen and Agatha appeared only seconds later and Rio wondered when Agatha’s chair had moved so close to her own but she said nothing. She was only vaguely aware that where Agatha’s arm was on her own armrest and Rio’s hand was on hers, her fingers were now grazing Agatha’s warm forearm.</p><p>“I’m not sure I’m ready to get back to work again,” Rio said quietly as she cradled her cold drink to her chest, shivering slightly in the cool of the evening.</p><p>“Seems cruel to be so soon.”</p><p>“When do you leave for London?”</p><p>“Mm, Alice?”</p><p>“Day after tomorrow. Just enough time to,” she waved her hand vaguely, clearly the gin had hit her hard too, “y’know.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and her fingers stretched until they curled around Agatha’s wrist, seeking the warmth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move away.</p><p>“Call my mom and wash my clothes?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice said with a smile.</p><p>Rio hummed and closed her eyes as she relaxed more in her chair, her thumb now brushing idly over soft skin.</p><p>“Well,” Jen said, the most sober of all of them, “When we’re back I think we both need a detox cleanse. This is the most alcohol either of us have had in weeks. You’re bad influences.”</p><p>Rio only grinned, her eyes still closed and allowed Alice to take this one for the both of them: “It’s good to let loose a little.”</p><p>“Not as loose as Rio, though. Sex on a public beach?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened and she was suddenly aware of the place spinning around her, the only solid think she could grasp was Agatha’s arm beneath her hand.</p><p>“Hey, she was hot and I was horny. Nothing much to it.”</p><p>“That easy, huh?”</p><p>“When you look like this,” Rio turned to Agatha with a grin and crossed her eyes to make her laugh.</p><p>“Goofy,” Agatha confirmed and she moved her free hand over to run up Rio’s arm closest to her.</p><p>Rio only continued to grin at her, delighted with herself that Agatha was paying her any attention at all, let alone smiling back at her, let alone rubbing her forearm.</p><p>“Hey, hey,” Jen snapped her fingers across the table and both turned to look at her, “Tweedle dumb and tweedle drunk. You’re <em>both</em> goofy tonight. What’s happening?”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant forwards to place her drink down, groaning a little when the world lurched a little more around her.</p><p>“I should probably go to bed.”</p><p>“No, stay!” Alice demanded suddenly, leaning forwards to reach for Rio. “Stay, it’s our last night. Sleep it off tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and briefly closed her eyes, “No, I need sleep.”</p><p>If she’d been cognisant at all, she’d have felt the soft squeeze of her arm before Agatha released her but she missed it as she stood slowly and waved in the direction of the table before making a wobbly path up to her bed.</p><p>It was best to go earlier, she thought. The night had already been full of temptation, full of a promise that could never become reality.</p><p>And she felt herself slipping closer and closer to being sloppy drunk.</p><p>To maybe just pulling Agatha to her. To maybe risking it all for a woman who’d already told her she had no interest in women.</p><p>So leaving whilst she had at least a brain cell still firing was the best option.</p><p>Rio woke in the night because a sudden chill in the room made her shiver beneath the thin sheet of the bed.</p><p>She rubbed at her eyes and hissed as her exposed hand felt the cool air hit it.</p><p>“Did I wake you?”</p><p>The voice felt far away, not behind her where it should be in the bed, but in front of her. And Rio opened her eyes to blink into the dim-light of the early hours and saw Agatha silhouetted against the pale moonlight of the little balcony.</p><p>“No,” Rio said softly, “It’s just a bit cold.”</p><p>She saw Agatha nod and watched as she dropped the lit cigarette in her hand, stomping it out with her foot before she stepped back into the room.</p><p>“You can stay out, don’t worry.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quietly, turning to shut the windowed doors and drag the light curtain across them. “Bad habit.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you smoked,” Rio said with a yawn, curling in on herself a little more to protect from the chill.</p><p>“I don’t. Not often anyway.”</p><p>Agatha moved back around to the other side of the bed and Rio turned to watch her as she opened a drawer and pulled out a little bottle of pills.</p><p>“What’re those?”</p><p>“I,” Agatha began and paused as she looked down at the little bottle in her hand, “I don’t sleep well. Doctor says it’s chronic insomnia and I’ve been this way since I was a kid so… sometimes I just pop a pill and it helps. I’d had too much wine earlier so didn’t take one.”</p><p>“Hence the smoking,” Rio concluded softly, frowning where she saw goosebumps along Agatha’s arm where she still sat in the cold of the room, her top half not yet under the blankets.</p><p>“Get under the covers. It’s cold.”</p><p>Agatha did as she was told and turned on her side to look at Rio, frowning a little in the dim as Rio reached for the hand that curled around the little pill bottle.</p><p>“Agatha you could have frozen to death out there. You’re <em>freezing</em>.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said softly, and Rio huffed, shuffling closer.</p><p>Perhaps it was the wine and gin in her system still, perhaps it was the vague haze of a disturbed sleep that emboldened her to do it, maybe it was just because it was the last time she’d ever get the chance to, but she pried the pills from Agatha’s hand and leant over her to place them on the side.</p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Turn.”</p><p>And Agatha did, turning back over onto her side, facing away from Rio in the same way she had the previous night when Rio had first shared this bed with her.</p><p>Only this time, Rio moved in behind her and draped an arm over her middle, aligning her body along Agatha’s to get as close as possible, in a selfless attempt to keep her warm and a selfish attempt to keep herself warm.</p><p>Their bodies fit together like two pieces of the same puzzle and Rio couldn’t help the flutter of need that settled low in her stomach.</p><p>It didn’t occur to her that this may not have been a welcome move until she’d done it.</p><p>And Agatha’s body had stiffened which made Rio regret her choice instantly.</p><p>But as if it had only been because it was a surprise, she soon felt her relaxing against her.</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned her head slightly, keeping some semblance of distance between her face and the back of Agatha’s neck for fear she’d never want to leave this position if she didn’t.</p><p>But she turned into the pillow they now both shared and quietly breathed in the scent of Agatha that remained there, her arm flexing around her middle as she did.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Drunk on the feel of Agatha against her and the soft smell of her hair, Rio hummed a response instead of speaking it and felt Agatha turn slowly, careful not to jog Rio too much as she did.</p><p>“Turn over.”</p><p>Rio blinked her eyes open and despite the chill of the air around them she felt her cheeks heat up in a blush and she nodded quickly, mortified that she’d been dismissed.</p><p>She turned onto her other side quickly and began to shuffle her way up the bed, feeling the mattress beneath her move from warm to cold as she went.</p><p>But just as she reached her pillow and made to move further along, a hand caught around her middle and Agatha wrapped her arm fully around her waist, tucking her fingers beneath Rio’s right side and pulling her back.</p><p>“Not that far,” she heard Agatha chastise gently behind her and suddenly felt the press of Agatha’s body against her, but properly this time, Agatha’s hold on her much bolder than Rio had dared to be.</p><p>She adjusted herself to curl her legs a little inwards and felt Agatha slip down slightly to curl her own to mould herself to Rio, the arm that was now trapped between them slipping below the pillow to support their heads.</p><p>Rio, who had been on the verge of slipping back into sleep not seconds ago, suddenly now felt wide awake, too conscious of Agatha Harkness wrapped around her for any hope of sleep to creep back in.</p><p>She focused on keeping her breathing even, but found it difficult when she could feel Agatha’s soft breaths against the skin at the back of her neck.</p><p>She cautiously moved her right hand up below the pillow to seek Agatha’s hand and found when she lightly brushed her fingers that Agatha reached down to hold her right back.</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt in her chest and she felt Agatha squeeze her waist, making a move to press a little closer.</p><p>She kept quiet for just a few more seconds before she spoke again: “You didn’t take your pill.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha murmured quietly. “I think I’ll be okay tonight.”</p><p>Rio nodded cautiously, not wanting to disturb Agatha anymore, aware she’d been the one to take her pills away in the first place.</p><p>But Agatha was warm and her body was soft against her and as she allowed herself to focus on that, she soon found that sleep wasn’t lost to her either.</p><p>There was no room between them for guilt over Agatha’s untaken pills, or for logic to creep in that this wasn’t a rational thing to allow for a person trying to fight a crush.</p><p>But when Rio woke the next morning, she woke alone.</p><p>For the first few seconds between waking and sleeping she wasn’t sure if she’d dreamed Agatha holding her all night.</p><p>It had felt so real, so warm.</p><p>But there was no evidence Agatha had even been in the bed, let alone curled around Rio as she slept.</p><p>As she turned to survey the room, she saw that even the little bottle of pills were gone.</p><p>Maybe she had dreamt it.</p><p>But worse than Agatha not being there, though that was definitely a close second, was the dull throb of a headache.</p><p>It felt like half-hangover, half-something else. And Rio didn’t need to guess what that may be.</p><p>Just as she was peeling the sheets from her body, the door opened and Alice bolted in.</p><p>“Oh thank god, you’re awake. We don’t have long. The car will be here in thirty minutes.”</p><p>Rio made a noncommittal noise and yawned as she followed Alice back out to the other room where her suitcase still lived.</p><p>She sourced a t-shirt and light sweatpants and underwear and then disappeared into the en suite to shower and change.</p><p>By the time she was done, Alice was now frantic in her haste to get Rio down the stairs and ready by the door.</p><p>“Yes, yes. Coming, coming.”</p><p>The dull throb of her head was back and wasn’t helped as Rio heaved her heavy suitcase down the stairs, greeted by Jen and Agatha who were lounging on the couch and armchair respectively.</p><p>Rio made brief eye contact with Agatha and found her smiling at her which eased her waking nerves a little but Alice was on her again and soon Rio was back in a dark mood.</p><p>“On the way to the airport we need to discuss timings for flights to London.”</p><p>“God, Alice. Can’t I just take it easy?”</p><p>“You’ve taken it easy for two days. We agreed that. Now it’s work time again.”</p><p>Rio groaned but her retort was lost when she felt a hand suddenly brush her arm as Agatha moved beside her.</p><p>“Technically, it’s still vacation time. I say at least until we’re halfway over the atlantic.”</p><p>“Amen,” Jen chorused from the couch and Rio smirked across at Alice, who didn’t look thrilled about being outnumbered.</p><p>“Fine,” she said with a huff, before pointing at Rio firmly, “halfway over the Atlantic.”</p><p>Rio only hummed her agreement and Agatha pulled her hand away as Rio said a quick, “thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>They looked at each other for a fraction longer than was strictly necessary and Rio felt the same warm comfort she’d felt the night before. But this time Agatha wasn’t even touching her.</p><p>Just as Rio was about to turn away, for fear she’d stare forever, Agatha raised her hand to touch her cheek, “Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>She looked concerned, as if totally unaware that Rio had potentially had the best sleep of her life the night before.</p><p>The grin that took over her face at the absurdity of the question made Agatha frown and step back a little and Rio realised she must have thought she was making fun of her.</p><p>But laughter had spilled out anyway and Agatha was turning away so Rio had to scramble to get her to turn back, reaching one hand to her wrist and tugging to get her to turn back.</p><p>“I’m laughing because,” she glanced around quickly, seeing the back of Alice’s head close to Jen’s now on the couch.</p><p>They weren’t listening. They didn’t care.</p><p>But she lowered her voice anyway.</p><p>“I slept great.”</p><p>Agatha still looked cautious but she nodded slowly, a frown still present on her features.</p><p>“Good. I was worried you wouldn’t.”</p><p>There was the dull pain in her head again, and Rio knew what it was now: it wasn’t just <em>about</em> Agatha.</p><p>It was about <em>leaving</em> Agatha.</p><p>Because this little fantasy that she’d been able to carve out for herself whilst here, it was suddenly everything.</p><p>She cleared her throat softly and squeezed Agatha’s wrist where she still held it.</p><p>“And you? Did you sleep at all?”</p><p>“Actually,” Agatha started but was interrupted by the sound of a knock at the villa door.</p><p>Rio pulled away suddenly, turning quickly before she could change her mind.</p><p>This had to be it. This had to be enough.</p><p>She’d had one night of feeling like Agatha might feel even a piece of what she felt for her, and that would have to continue to be enough.</p><p>They all went out to the Mercedes van that had arrived for them and Agatha slipped in first, clearly used to having someone else always take her bags for her because she didn’t even bother to offer the driver any help.</p><p>Jen did the same.</p><p>Rio and Alice just looked at each other, then helped heave the last of the bags into the trunk and went around to jump in the car.</p><p>Of the six seats available, obviously only two were occupied.</p><p>The issue was that one person sat in the very back of the car and the other sat in the front row.</p><p>Jen was in front.</p><p>Agatha in back.</p><p>And Rio knew where she’d have to sit to avoid the wrath of Jen. And Alice.</p><p>She clambered in quickly, not wanting to draw attention to it, and took her seat along the same row as Agatha, sliding the seat in front of her back down until it clipped in at the bottom.</p><p>Rio slid her sunglasses from her head and relaxed back into the comfortable leather seats, pressing a variety of buttons until she felt the seat warmer switch on and she could rest her head back, bracing herself for an hour and a half in close proximity with Agatha for the last time.</p><p>The car was mostly silent the whole way there, and it turned out that Rio’s concerns were unfounded.</p><p>She and Agatha hadn’t spoken, they hadn’t even touched.</p><p>The next contact Rio made with Agatha had been when she’d lifted her suitcase out and their hands had briefly met over the handle.</p><p>It was fleeting, but their eyes met and Rio thought she saw a sadness in Agatha’s eyes that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>But Alice was pushing her along, making sure Rio didn’t dawdle through security so they could board the plane on time.</p><p>Alice, as usual, had timed everything perfectly so that by the time they arrived at the gate they were already ready to board.</p><p>Rio moved on autopilot, always aware of where Agatha was in relation to her.</p><p>Two feet away.</p><p>Right beside her.</p><p>Behind her.</p><p>The window seat on the other side of the plane.</p><p>Her only means of distraction on the long flight back were the movies in the entertainment system.</p><p>But halfway through the flight, three glasses of red wine in, she lost all sense of where she was and the danger she’d be putting herself in by doing what she did.</p><p>She put on one of Agatha’s movies.</p><p>It was her Oscar-winning role. The story of a ex-concert pianist cutdown in her prime by a car accident that left her unable to play.</p><p>Rio had seen it more times than she could count.</p><p>But it was comforting to see Agatha’s face without worrying what she was thinking about, or how badly Rio could misread the way she was looking at her.</p><p>“Really?” A voice came from somewhere above her. “This one? Not Susan Sarandon flying off a cliff?”</p><p>Rio sat bolt upright when she realised who it was, and narrowly avoided sloshing her wine down her front.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said lamely, quickly reaching to switch the little tv off, ripping her headphones from her head, though the damage had already been done.</p><p>Agatha only smiled a little, her hand resting on the partition that separated Rio from the aisle beside her.</p><p>“I just came to tell you that Alice is now sitting with Jen which I think means you’re safe from work chat at least until we land.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said distractedly, her blush now taking over her face.</p><p>She took a shot and glanced briefly up at Agatha, barely able to make eye contact, but saw that Agatha was smirking at the sight of Rio looking so mortified.</p><p>“Don’t say anything. It’s a good film.”</p><p>“I know. I won the Oscar for it.”</p><p>Agatha bit down on lower lip and surveyed Rio for a second before she reached in and down, flicking the little handle to let herself into Rio’s semi-private booth.</p><p>Rio had turned the seat into a bed and so pulled her legs up towards her so Agatha had space to sit and she did. It felt strangely awkward between them, despite the fact that they’d been curled around each other the whole of the previous night.</p><p>And where Rio must still look mortified, Agatha looked cautious again.</p><p>“I think when we land we’ll be met with a whole bunch of press so…” she trailed off and Rio realised that she was saying goodbye.</p><p>She cleared her throat quietly and only nodded in response, reaching her hand out for Agatha to take. And she did, and held it in both her own.</p><p>“I’ll see you at the awards shows?”</p><p>“I’ll be the one in the fancy dress looking for a way out of there.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and dropped her gaze to their hands, her face softening totally until her smile disappeared and Rio watched, mesmerised by the view.</p><p>Agatha had taken her hand and turned it over slowly in her own, holding Rio’s hand palm up. She held her fingers above it, as if replicating that kid’s game of sprinkling imaginary sand into someone’s palm to see if you could get them to feel it.</p><p>But there was nothing imaginary about how she spread her fingers slowly up until they slipped between Rio’s and she entwined them again, her thumb moving to brush gently along Rio’s.</p><p>The caress over her palm sent shivers down Rio’s spine and she was so focused on the thumb now brushing her skin that she almost missed Agatha’s words:</p><p>“I think I’ll miss you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t looked back up yet and Rio was glad of it, for fear she might lose the nerve to say: “I know I’ll miss you.”</p><p>But she’d said it and Agatha looked up slowly, and when their eyes met Rio felt sick with it. Already at a loss for how to possibly get over not seeing Agatha every day.</p><p>But Agatha had a life to get back to. And a family.</p><p>And Rio had a life too.</p><p>They just didn’t belong in each other’s.</p><p>Agatha seemed to feel the same because she ducked her head and turned Rio’s hand over, pressing a swift kiss to the back of it before she stood just as swiftly, leaving Rio sitting all alone in her little cabin in the sky wondering how she could have been so stupid—because ‘happily married’ meant nothing when Agatha looked at her like that.</p>

<p>It was 3am.</p><p>Two hours before her alarm would be going off.</p><p>And her phone was buzzing gently on the side.</p><p><em>Alice.</em></p><p>It had to be. No one else was able to break through Rio’s Do Not Disturb settings.</p><p>She threw her arm out of the nest she’d created for herself in the middle of her bed, slapped her fingers down until she could just about grip the end of her phone and pulled it back into the safety and warmth of her nest.</p><p>“Alice. What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Have you seen it?”</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“Just after seven, why? Oh shit.”</p><p>“Seven your time? You bitch.”</p><p>“I forgot. This is important. You’ll want to see it.”</p><p>Rio groaned loudly, louder than she would normally, if her publicist weren’t on the other end of the line having woken her up. She wanted her to feel guilty.</p><p>“I have to be up in two hours,” she complained, doing the quick math in her head.</p><p>“You’ll want to see this. I’ve sent it to you.”</p><p>Rio huffed again and with her free hand she rubbed her eyes, shuffling her tired body until she was sitting up against the headboard.</p><p>“Watch it. Then call me back, okay?”</p><p>“I hate you.”</p><p>“Love you too.”</p><p>Alice hung up then and Rio briefly considered going back to sleep but knew Alice would be a terror if she didn’t do as she was told.</p><p>She squinted in the semi-darkness of her swanky suite and unlocked her phone. It was almost insulting that her iPhone recognised her face when it was this scrunched up and exhausted, but that was a concern for another day.</p><p>She had multiple messages in her WhatsApp inbox, some from random group chats, others from friends reaching out to see how shooting was going.</p><p>A couple from her mom she needed to get back to, and even one from her dad, which meant she really needed to get back to her mom.</p><p>She wasn’t the best at responding when not busy but when she was shooting and spending her time either on set or in bed, she became almost unreachable.</p><p>She clicked into the chat she had with Alice and saw three messages from only five minutes ago sitting waiting:<br/>
‘Wake up!!!’</p><p>‘Watch this. Call me back’</p><p>And beneath those was a link to a YouTube video from W Magazine entitled: ‘Agatha Harkness says “happiness” is movies with her son | W Magazine’.</p><p>The video was 4:53 minutes long but Alice had sent it so it opened to a specific time and whilst an ad popped up for some random airline Rio took the opportunity to pull the heavy duvet closer around her, turning her phone to landscape so she could get a better view.</p><p>She hadn’t thought about Agatha properly in weeks now.</p><p>Only when congratulating herself on not thinking about her had she entered her mind. Or when Alice was talking about Jen. Which basically meant she’d thought about her all the time.</p><p>So she couldn’t help but feel a little titillated at the prospect of seeing her face properly again for the first time in a while. Even if it were in black and white on her phone.</p><p>Even if it were 3am.</p><p>The ad finished and the video loaded and Rio was wide awake all of a sudden, watching as a black and white version of Agatha Harkness looked down the barrel of the camera at her.</p><p>She was wearing minimal makeup, her hair wild and… was it unbrushed? Rio couldn’t imagine a world where Agatha would allow herself to be filmed looking unkempt so she assumed it was the stylist’s choice.</p><p>She wanted to buy that stylist a three martini lunch.</p><p>Either way, she watched as her hand moved up to scrunch it slightly and Agatha’s eyes darted down as the interviewer’s voice started up: “Who is your favourite actor?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little at the sides and Rio lost her breath as blue eyes moved back up to look at the camera: “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Can you expand on that?”</p><p>“She’s this ball of charisma, this wild and untameable force.”</p><p>Rio felt her cheeks heat up and her grip tighten on her phone.</p><p>“But she’s so calm when she’s on screen, as if she’s totally at peace with herself and what she’s doing. She’s naturalistic in a way that,” Agatha’s brow furrowed a little and she dropped her gaze in a look that told Rio she was thinking carefully about her next words. “…I so respect and admire.”</p><p>She looked back up and there was a smile threatening her features.</p><p>“Would you like to work with her?”</p><p>Her brow quirked and her tongue darted out briefly to wet her lower lip.</p><p>“Without a doubt.”</p><p>The interviewer had moved on to another subject but Rio had suddenly gone deaf, a violent ringing had filled her ears and she simply stared at Agatha on her little screen, watching her respond without knowing what she was saying.</p><p>She shut it down quickly and called Alice back.</p><p>“What the fuck.”</p><p>“My phone started to blow up and before I could even see what was going on Jen called to tell me.”</p><p>“What the fuck, Alice. She didn’t tell Jen? Wasn’t Jen in the room?”</p><p>“You know how W works those interviews. No questions before taping, no publicists in the room. Just you and the interviewer.”</p><p>Alice was right. Rio had done her own version of this interview not a month prior.</p><p>She’d mostly answered questions about her childhood, her hobbies, her approach to roles, but she hadn’t been asked about her favourite actor.</p><p>“Agatha didn’t tell her?”</p><p>“No. She had no idea.”</p><p>“I… I can’t believe she said all that.”</p><p>“I told you being friends with her would help. I <em>told</em> you it would work in your favour.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said slowly, frowning down at the soft floral pattern of her high-thread count sheets. “Agatha wouldn’t just say me because we were on vacation together. She’s not a liar.”</p><p>“Give me this one win, Rio. Because that answer will secure you a lot of support from the actor’s arm of The Academy, I know it.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was still hammering in her chest, the last thing on her mind the reaction of other actors to this endorsement by the one and only Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Have you spoken to her?”</p><p>“No. But Jen was pretty pissed. Obviously she wants Agatha to win so-…”</p><p>“Can you get me her number?”</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“No,” Rio paused, second-guessing asking. “Agatha’s.”</p><p>“Sure. I’ll get Jen to send it.”</p><p>Rio went silent for a second and found herself twirling her hair as she stared absently towards the curtain-covered windows, “You think she really meant it?”</p><p>Despite what she’d just said about knowing Agatha not to be a liar, not to just say things because she thought she should, she was suddenly second-guessing herself. It was a big thing to claim: that Rio was her favourite actress.</p><p>There were so many greats past and present she could have named, that were far better. Industry legends and people with nominations and wins that Rio didn’t have. And yet…</p><p>“Rio, babe. You are so good at what you do. I was kidding about the friendship thing. And you’re right… Agatha wouldn’t have said it if she didn’t mean it.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and closed her eyes, “I think I’m just tired.”</p><p>“Get another hour’s sleep and call me later. Remember I’ll be out in a couple days. You’ve press on Sunday so no partying. As much rest as possible.”</p><p>“Says the person who called me at 3am to wake me up to watch-…”</p><p>“And before I forget,” Alice interjected quickly, “your mom’s been on to me about getting you to get back to her.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shuffled back down the bed, “I’ll call today. Get her off your back.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Call me later, okay?”</p><p>“Night, Alice.”</p><p>“Night, Rio.”</p><p>Rio hung up and looked back up at her phone she now held above her head where she lay, far too wired to get back to sleep. A freeze-frame of Agatha stared back at her and she wondered what possessed her to mention her name.</p><p>The interview must have happened recently. Her own interview with W was filmed one morning and released the next week.</p><p>So she’d been away on vacation with her and then, what? Suddenly decided Rio was a good actress? That couldn’t be right.</p><p>A little modal popped over the top of the screen and Rio saw that Alice had shared a contact with her. Nothing if not efficient.</p><p>She clicked into it, using her sleep-deprived brain to give her enough courage and she saved the number quickly before tapping out a message.</p><p>‘A wild and untameable force?’</p><p>She didn’t leave her name on the message, and mentally kicked herself for not doing so but double-texting was more embarrassing than just leaving it how it was so she clicked out of the message and jumped back to the interview.</p><p>She rewound it and watched Agatha answer the question again.</p><p>Just as she was focusing in on the way Agatha looked into the camera, and looked away when she was thinking, a message appeared again at the top of the screen.</p><p>3:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Who is this?</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath and stared at the popup until it disappeared, debating whether or not it was a good idea to respond when she had to be ready for her pick up time in just over two hours and she’d barely had five hours’ sleep.</p><p>She lost the fight against her better angels.</p><p>3:18am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Your favorite actor.</p><p>If Agatha didn’t want to play ball, Rio knew she wouldn’t. She’d ignore the message or tell Rio she’d been taken by surprise and hers was the first name that popped into her head.</p><p>And that was fine. But Rio hoped she wouldn’t. She hoped she’d rise to the bait.</p><p>The thought of it sent a little jolt of thrill through her.</p><p>3:20am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Aren’t you on London time? Why are you watching my interviews at 3am?</p><p>3:21am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Alice woke me to tell me the news.</p><p>3:22am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: That I mentioned your name in an interview?</p><p>3:23am<br/>
Rio Vidal: She’s thorough.</p><p>3:24am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: So are you texting to thank me?</p><p>3:26am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I don’t know. Would that make you respect and admire me more?</p><p>3:27am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Don’t make me regret it.</p><p>3:28am<br/>
Rio Vidal: I think Alice is going to send you a thank you gift. Perhaps a selection of my movies for you to enjoy.</p><p>3:29am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Go to sleep, Rio.</p><p>3:30am<br/>
Rio Vidal: If it helps, you’re mine.</p><p>3:34am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Your what?</p><p>3:35am:<br/>
Rio Vidal: Favorite actor.</p><p>3:36am:<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Go to sleep.</p><p>Rio smiled a little at her phone, imagining Agatha’s expression as she stared at the three words of her last message. She sighed quietly and had to roll her eyes at herself for finding even the way she text to be attractive.</p><p>An ocean of distance, almost two months since Italy, and three timezones apart made absolutely no difference to her crush.</p><p>Knowing it wouldn’t help her case to keep bothering Agatha via text, she put her phone beside her on the pillow and curled back in on herself to try to force at least an hour’s worth of sleep.</p><p>She managed it, and slept soundly until the obnoxious sound of her alarm woke her to warn her she had thirty minutes before she’d be picked up.</p><p>In the scramble to shower and change, she’d forgotten about the interruption to her beauty sleep and only when she had a chance to check her messages in the back of the comfortable hired car did she remember.</p><p>Alice had thankfully left her alone between the hours of 3:30 and 5am. Only now was she messaging, knowing Rio would be fully awake and on her way to work.</p><p>5:32am<br/>
Alice WG: So many people want a comment about Agatha’s good taste!!!</p><p>5:33am<br/>
Alice WG: But think it’s much cooler if we ignore in any official capac. If any paps ask: say flattered, good friend, a huge fan, etc etc</p><p>5:33am<br/>
Alice WG: Get to set safe - call later x</p><p>Amongst all the other messages she was still to wade through, and Rio remembered with a stab of guilt she really did need to call her parents, there was another sitting in her inbox from Agatha.</p><p>4:59am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: When you’re back, perhaps you can thank me properly by coming good on your offer to play basketball with Nicky?</p><p>Rio stared at the message for a full five minutes, wondering how long Agatha had been thinking about sending it since her last message a full how and thirty minutes before.</p><p>But surely she’d not thought about it at all? Surely she’d just been thinking about her son or her son and basketball and randomly remembered that Rio, a few weeks ago, had offered to play basketball with him.</p><p>When they’d been in the pool together.</p><p>When Rio’s legs had been around her waist and when Rio had thought for a second, just a second, that Agatha may kiss her.</p><p>But it was too early to be second-guessing Agatha again.</p><p>She put her phone away and distracted herself by speaking to her driver, and used his chat to forget about the early morning surprise.</p><p>By the time she arrived on set, Rio was too busy to be able to think much more about Agatha’s suggestion. Though it fell into her mind every once in a while when things got quieter.</p><p>Being on set without Alice wasn’t her favourite place to be.</p><p>She had already made good friends with the cast and was friendly with almost all the crew too, but in her downtime where she could sit in her trailer for a while, she missed having her best friend around.</p><p>But setlife took over for a couple days and Agatha’s text sat unanswered in her inbox.</p><p>One evening she’d stayed out with two of her fellow cast members and had too much to drink for someone who had to be awake at 5am and know her lines the next day.</p><p>And in that precious time between falling into bed and falling asleep, she decided to talk to Alice about it.</p><p>She’d been struggling through like a pathetic loser pining after someone unattainable. She now knew she needed the help of her friend.</p><p>And so, halfway through the day on set the next day, when she arrived at her trailer for an hour’s turnaround where she could take a quick nap or call her parents (which she was still yet to do), she was delighted to find Alice already there and waiting for her.</p><p>“This place is a mess, Rio.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio said with a grin as she tackled Alice in a hug so hard she knocked them both down onto the couch.</p><p>Alice’s cackle filled the trailer and Rio felt at home in there for the first time since she’d arrived.</p><p>Still, Alice was shoving her off so she rolled away with a grin.</p><p>“Miss me much?”</p><p>“Like you wouldn’t believe.”</p><p>Alice laughed and her smile faded to something softer as she pulled her legs up beneath her and turned properly to her friend.</p><p>“You look tired.”</p><p>“I’m <em>exhausted</em>.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t happen to be because you were out until the early hours last night, would it?”</p><p>“Who told you?”</p><p>“I have my spies.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but had her suspicions that it was probably one of the younger actors who liked his gossip as much as he liked his coke.</p><p>“Fine. Maybe I was. I just needed to let off some steam.”</p><p>Alice nodded slowly and watched Rio for a second before asking, “Everything okay? Lily says everything’s great, your performance is outstanding and she’s really excited for the final cut.”</p><p>Rio nodded in acknowledgement, pleased her director wasn’t just blowing smoke up her ass every time she praised her performance on set. But she knew Alice was giving her an opening and so she took it.</p><p>“Actually, I want to run something by you. Something that… well something stupid. But I can’t shake. And I’m telling you as your <em>friend</em>, not as your client, okay? Be my friend with it.”</p><p>Alice raised her brows but shifted and placed a hand on Rio’s knee where it rested against the back of the couch, “You got it. What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s so stupid,” Rio qualified, already finding it hard to voice the embarrassing thing that had such a hold on her for months now.</p><p>“That’s okay. I’ve seen and heard you do many stupid things. And you me.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and ran a hand through her hair. “I have a crush. A big, fat, inconvenient crush.”</p><p>“Rio, not on Lily. You can’t screw the director.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said with a small frown, “Agatha.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know how she’d expected Alice to react but laughter wasn’t it.</p><p>“Right, okay, and who doesn’t? Half the population is in love with her.”</p><p>“No, look… it’s hard to explain. I just…” Rio cleared her throat and pulled her knees to her chest, dislodging Alice’s hand. “I think about her a lot.”</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said slowly, looking at Rio closely and with a slight suspicion in her gaze, “You know she’s married, right? And like, has a son and everything? With a man?”</p><p>Rio huffed and rolled her eyes, “Yes, people keep telling me.”</p><p>Alice frowned and began chewing on her lip, “Okay… Jen mentioned something a while back about you being a big flirt when Agatha was around but… it’s just a crush, it’ll disappear.”</p><p>“That’s the thing, Alice. I don’t know. It’s been <em>weeks</em> since I’ve seen her and-…”</p><p>“Rio, is it just because you can’t have her?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Look, you’re a hot movie star. You can usually get whoever you want. And I mean <em>anyone</em> but Agatha… well she doesn’t want you and maybe that’s just it. You want her because you can’t have her.”</p><p>Rio blinked and for a second felt mortified, horrified that her friend had psychoanalysed her so mercilessly.</p><p>Maybe that was it. Maybe she was forbidden fruit and so every interaction she’d had with her Rio was reading into it, bolstering the fantasy.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want her. Rio wanted her because she didn’t want her.</p><p>She’d been wrong to read into the touches and smiles, Agatha simply found her amusing, knew she was flirting, and was secure enough to flirt a little back.</p><p>But then the was the way she kept close, the way she’d wrapped herself so securely around Rio that last night.</p><p>Because maybe Agatha was happily married but Rio was convinced she had even a slight curiosity about Rio. She knew she found her charming. She knew she touched her far more than she’d seen her touch Alice or even Jen.</p><p>But she couldn’t bring herself to vocalise all of this.</p><p>For one she’d be accusing a married straight woman of flirting with her which went against her general moral code and for another, perhaps she was wrong and Alice was right.</p><p>“Holy shit. That can’t be it, Alice. I’m… fuck, am I an asshole?”</p><p>Alice laughed, cracking the tension in the air immediately with the noise. “I mean… you’re not <em>not</em> an asshole.”</p><p>“God,” Rio put her head between her knees and groaned loudly, “all this time I thought I was going insane with it.”</p><p>Alice shuffled closer until her knees were just before Rio’s feet and she pushed at the top of her head to get her to look at her: “You need to get laid. When was the last time-… Oh. Is <em>this</em> why you went rogue and fucked some poor girl on the beach?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes a little but didn’t have the strength to keep it up so flopped her head back down, “I was trying to get it out of my system.”</p><p>“Oh babe,” Alice laughed again, “Get over yourself. She doesn’t want you. I know it may be a shock to the system but just deal with it. Like the rest of us have to. Do you know how many times I’ve been left wanting?”</p><p>“Shut up, you do just fine. Besides, you have a hot girlfriend.”</p><p>“One I hardly ever see.”</p><p>“You’ve just flown back to LA for a week to be with her.”</p><p>“A week is barely any time at all. We were both still working.”</p><p>Rio just huffed a heavy breath and lifted her head slowly, reluctantly meeting Alice’s amused gaze, “You think that’s really it? I’m a dick?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m afraid so.”</p><p>“Did Jen really call out my flirting?”</p><p>“Yes. She said you may as well have crawled on top of her and stuck your tongue down her throat.”</p><p>Rio grimaced a little and had to fight the images that conjured in her mind.</p><p>“I wasn’t that bad.”</p><p>“I think she was just pissed that Agatha gave you that photo.”</p><p>Sighing softly, Rio fished her phone from her back pocket and clicked about until she turned it around to show Alice the texts from Agatha.</p><p>Alice read through them and raised her brows, “Please don’t tell me you’ve left Agatha Harkness on read for three days.”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>. Get a grip. Text her back. Say you’re sorry you’ve been busy but would <em>love</em> to teach her son basketball or whatever.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but stole her phone back and put it to the side, “I was overthinking it.”</p><p>“Clearly. Look, you’re both at the top of your game, you’re both used to getting what you want, you’re both hot. But think about it this way, if she were into you, it would never work out anyway. You’d have one hot night together and then it would be hell every time you saw her. At least this way you get to enjoy her pretty smiles and not worry about her icing you out of the industry.”</p><p>Rio hated to admit when Alice was right, but she was. At least about this part. And so Rio nodded and picked her phone back up to send the response that was three days overdue.</p><p>1:09pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Sorry, work has been manic. I’d love to. After Venice I have a week or so early September back in LA. Let me know time and date and I’ll be there.</p><p>She turned her phone back around to show Alice and her friend beamed at her before snatching her phone away to check her call log.</p><p>“You ass. Call your mother.”</p><p>Rio laughed and snatched her phone back, “Dick.”</p><p>Alice, despite her teasing of Rio the rest of the day about her disastrous crush - whenever she got a chance between filming - insisted Rio have an early night so she could rest up for the following day of no filming but press instead.</p><p>The production company had worked around Rio’s schedule so that she could do press for <em>All The Wrong Gods</em> as the awards machine continued to pick up momentum.</p><p>What that meant, though, was that a usual press day of anywhere between 6-8 hours was now a full 12.</p><p>Rio was back to back with journalists from practically the moment she woke up, doing call-ins to radio shows, sitting in hair and makeup whilst she spoke to journalists in the room with her, heading for lunch for publications doing longreads, and sitting in a small stuffy room answering the same questions again and again about a movie she’d made over a year ago.</p><p>Her only respite during this time was Alice who kept her morale up by feeding her snacks, making sure she had plenty of coffee, and plenty of moments to complain when out of earshot of everyone else.</p><p>It was just after lunch with a journalist from <em>The Times</em> when the response to her message to Agatha came through.</p><p>Her phone had vibrated in her pocket as she hugged the journalist goodbye and Rio had checked it as she waited for her driver for the day to pick her up and take her back to the hotel where she was to do more interviews.</p><p>2:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: 4pm, after Nicky finishes school, 2nd, 2270 La Granada Dr.</p><p>This time, Rio didn’t make her wait.</p><p>2:22pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Looking forward to it. :)</p><p>She regretted the smiley face.</p><p>She didn’t receive a text back.</p><p>But that was fine. She’d sucked up her pride and decided that she would have to get over herself in order to get over Agatha. And she had over a month to do just that.</p><p>But a month goes by surprisingly quickly when all you do is work and sleep.</p><p>Alice was Rio’s lifeline, as usual, during this time.</p><p>She made sure Rio kept cheery during her ‘off’ days when she had to squeeze in more interviews that she’d ever done in her life. She made sure Rio had the right amount of sleep and the right amount of alcohol in her system at least once every two weeks to blow off steam but not ruin the next day.</p><p>She even convinced Rio that sleeping with the DP was not a good idea, which turned out to be great advice because the DP in question had a boyfriend and the boyfriend just so happened to be the Assistant Editor.</p><p>And Rio coached Alice through her pining for Jen. She helped her analyse everything phone conversation they’d had, every text that looked apathetic or every selfie where there appeared to be a pretty woman in the background.</p><p>It felt a lot like college all over again, where they were each other’s bastions of strength and support.</p><p>But perhaps the best thing Alice managed to do for Rio was to remind her weekly to call her mom.</p><p>And once this pattern was established, a grateful Anna Vidal sent a care package to Alice’s hotel room full of Puerto Rican snacks and a postcard from Delaware thanking her for managing Rio so well.</p><p>Rio was <em>not</em> happy about this and as punishment stole as much of the package for herself as she could.</p><p>But after filming wrapped and both her and Alice got so drunk at the wrap party neither was sure how they ended up in Rio’s bed the next morning in one piece, they still had another film festival to go.</p><p>Venice was a means to an end. A chance to campaign a little more in the European market but mostly to get Rio on the best dressed lists and get her face out there as much as possible.</p><p>Schmoozing. Rio could do it better than anyone.</p><p>And the best thing about Venice was that Wanda would be there, which meant Rio would have an ally other than Alice and someone else to complain to when it all got too much.</p><p>Alice had done Rio a solid and arranged for her and Wanda to arrive on the boat together, which meant that Rio could spend at least the first day of the festival with someone she liked and was technically working so Alice couldn’t tell her <em>not</em> to just stand gossiping with Wanda.</p><p>Turned out that this paid dividends for both Rio and Alice because whilst the press went insane over capturing the two of them together, Wanda had just finished filming on a set with a tyrannical director with a penchant for furious rages.</p><p>Which meant that Alice got what she wanted and so did Rio.</p><p>The gossip was so juicy that it continued into the late night as the three of them had dinner together in a small restaurant in the heart of the city.</p><p>“I’m telling you, I don’t understand how he’s still working.”</p><p>“He’s a man,” Rio said dismissively, swirling her Chianti, “and he’s considered a genius which is practically a pass for any kind of bad behaviour.”</p><p>“Rio, you don’t understand he was <em>savage</em>. At one point I thought he was going to go for the production assistant.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and Alice frowned at Wanda, “Did you have anyone come in to intervene?”</p><p>“No, a few of us-…” she stopped abruptly then because the waiter had come over to fill their wine glasses. When he was gone she cleared her throat and continued, “so, yeah, we rallied round, made sure everyone felt protected as best we could and… that was it.”</p><p>Rio reached for Wanda’s hand and squeezed it gently, “You could have called. I was just in London, I could have easily hopped a flight-…”</p><p>“Sweetheart, you <em>never</em> answer your phone. Plus if your schedule is anything like mine you wouldn’t have had any time to swoop in and do what, exactly?”</p><p>Rio shrugged but smiled a little, “I don’t know? Be a drinking buddy?”</p><p>“That’d help. Dealing with a maniac on a hangover.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pulled her hand away, “Whatever gets you through.”</p><p>Wanda smirked and took a sip of her drink before she turned to Alice with a sudden change of topic.</p><p>“So, Alice, you are in a lot of trouble with a lot of different people, I hope you know.”</p><p>This was news to Rio and apparently news to Alice who looked more than a little shocked as she placed her wine down. “Why?”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda grinned and Rio relaxed instantly, knowing it couldn’t be bad if Wanda were getting enjoyment out of it, “getting your client to be announced as the best actress alive right now’s favourite actress.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and ran a hand through her hair, “It’s so offensive that you don’t think I’m just <em>that good</em>.”</p><p>Wanda laughed and Alice smirked as she leant back in her chair, “Unfortunately I’m not powerful enough to make Agatha Harkness say anything she doesn’t want to so that was all Rio.”</p><p>“That good,” Rio repeated, shrugging with a grin and making Wanda roll her eyes at her.</p><p>“Unbelievable.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t think you’re winning though. It’s hers to take.”</p><p>“Oh, I know. And now Sylvia’s gone and said something racist it would be a miracle if she were even nominated.”</p><p>“I heard.”</p><p>Alice hummed quietly and glanced around them, cautious of any eavesdroppers, “It’s an industry town right now. Keep your voices down.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow and looked around briefly too, “I’m pretty sure everyone here is Italian and no one much cares what we’re saying.”</p><p>“Haven’t we had one too many lucky escapes with the press lately?”</p><p>Rio shifted in her seat, her eyes darting briefly to Wanda and hoping she wouldn’t pick up on Alice’s insinuation. But she did.</p><p>“What did they not get you on?”</p><p>“Alice, don’t.”</p><p>“What? You did it, the least you could do is own up to it.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and leant forwards towards Wanda, “I had a… moment with Agatha’s husband and then a… moment with a girl on a beach.”</p><p>“A moment? Is that what they’re calling it these days?”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant back again, “anyway, nothing happened so it’s nothing to worry about.”</p><p>“I don’t know, babe. It’s a little perverted if you ask me: sex on a beach and sex with another woman’s husband. Maybe speak to your therapist about it.”</p><p>Alice grinned at Wanda, enjoying having an ally in Rio-ribbing and Rio just smirked as she sipped her wine. “In case you hadn’t noticed I don’t swing that way and Ralph is… well I wouldn’t even if I did. Both very cruel friends.”</p><p>“You love us.”</p><p>“Unfortunately for me.”</p><p>So Venice went by easily, and Rio barely thought about her inconvenient crush at all.</p><p>She spent almost every second with Alice and now Wanda in tow, and focused her efforts on being as effortlessly charming for the interviewers and cameras as possible.</p><p>Every morning, Alice woke her with news of the previous night’s press.</p><p>“Everyone’s insane for the photos and you and Wanda on the boat. X is blowing up with people wanting you-…”</p><p>“Call it ‘Twitter’, please. We don’t like that man.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. Anyway, best dressed, best dressed, best dressed. You’ve practically won the festival.”</p><p>It helped a lot in moments like these, when Rio was exhausted in her bed and Alice was shoving her phone in her face, that Rio loved her best friend so much. She couldn’t imagine a world where Alice were just someone she paid and not someone she could happily see every moment of the day and not get sick of.</p><p>But by the time she was back home in her little house in the Hollywood Hills, Rio was determined to speak to no one and be comatose for two days.</p><p>The exception to this rule was of course Alice, though she was mostly busy fielding journalist requests and making up for lost time with Jen, and her mother, whom she called to tell all about the festival and to let her know she was home safe.</p><p>But two days of being horizontal soon disappeared and Rio, on the third day she was back from home, found that suddenly she felt rested and relaxed enough to actually be looking forward to seeing Agatha without the usual fear that she’d say or do something stupid or embarrassing - though there was always still that risk.</p><p>She hopped in the car with her hopes high that today would be a good day and called Alice on her way over, following Google Maps as she went.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Nervous?”</p><p>“No, I think… I think you cured me.”</p><p><em>Liar.</em></p><p>“Good. So all you need to do is not injure the kid and not try to kiss her or anything, okay?”</p><p>“Asshole. How’s Jen? You didn’t tell her about…?”</p><p>“Of course not. She’s fine. She’s away on a call with a studio. I told her I loved her last night.”</p><p>“You did? And?!”</p><p>“Well, she said it back.”</p><p>Rio laughed and grinned as she took the next turning, “Alice, I’m so pleased for you.”</p><p>“Not mad still we won’t both die alone together?”</p><p>“Nah, there’s room for Jen in our little beachfront retirement home.”</p><p>“I’ll be sure to let her know.”</p><p>“I’ll call you later, okay? When I’m heading back.”</p><p>“Sure. I need to talk to you about Late Night anyway.”</p><p>“Fine. Speak later.”</p><p>“Bye, Rio. Behave.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself as she watched the little phone modal disappear on her car display.</p><p>Alice was happy, maybe soon to be settled. Miracles did happen. It was enough to relax her further as she drove the rest of the way to Agatha’s home deep in the Hills.</p><p>The street was quiet, with large houses spread along it, all white buildings with terracotta roofs. It looked not unlike where Rio stayed though the houses along here were, admittedly, much larger than hers.</p><p>Rio pulled up slowly in front of Agatha’s home and as she turned the key in the ignition to shut off the engine she felt for the first time in weeks a sudden nervousness.</p><p>It crept over her body slowly, so that stepping out of the car felt like a momentous task. But it was 4:01pm so she had to make herself move for fear Agatha would consider her late.</p><p>She stepped out into the afternoon heat and reached in the back of her little hybrid to take the gifts she’d brought for Agatha and Nicky, wondering suddenly if she should have brought something more, something grander.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>She shouldered her bag of gifts and tucked the basketball she’d bought with her under her arm, took one last deep breath, and made for the gate. She pressed the buzzer and chewed the inside of her lip as she waited for it to grant her entry, wondering if Agatha had any staff who would greet her before she had to come face to face with her herself.</p><p>But she didn’t have to wait long.</p><p>Ten seconds later the sound of the gate unlocking let Rio know she could push it open and she entered into a small court yard before a stately 1930’s villa home.</p><p>The lawn either side of the little walkway was perfectly manicured with palms and bird of paradise plants along the edges. And above the entranceway, creating a grand porch, were two stone pillars, framing the arched front door that stood open with Agatha Harkness in the middle of it.</p><p>Rio’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of her but she forced herself to remain calm, repeating Alice’s words in her own mind: “Get over yourself.”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure you’d show.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? Basketball and an excuse to hang with my biggest fan? What would keep me away?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled warmly as Rio got closer and she stepped aside to let her in.</p><p>The impact of stepping into Agatha’s home was immediate. Even in the foyer it felt warm, comfortable, and it had Agatha’s signature charm all over it.</p><p>“He’s just out back,” Agatha said, answering a question Rio hadn’t even asked or considered as she turned to look at Agatha with an incredulous grin.</p><p>“You gotta give a girl a second to take this in. Your house is huge.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and hesitated for only a second before she placed a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek and then motioned for Rio to follow her.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip as she followed her through to the kitchen, taking her around the large round table in the middle of the square entranceway with a fresh floral arrangement in the middle of it, trying not to focus on the faint blush she knew to be across her cheeks now.</p><p>Rio turned this way and that, spotting an inviting looking living area to the side with a mosaic fireplace and a door off of that, noticing the mirrors and art on the walls and the soft furnishings that gave the white house colour and comfort.</p><p>“Seriously. My place is tiny compared to this.”</p><p>“If you don’t stop talking about how big my house is, I’ll ask you to leave.”</p><p>They’d arrived in the kitchen now and Rio had a sinking feeling that her gifts would leave quite a lot to be desired at the sight of it.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she mumbled quietly, but Agatha had caught it and raised a brow at her.</p><p>“What? You’ve been to industry parties before. You must have seen some of the mansions in the Hills.”</p><p>“Yeah, but they’re all glass and metal this is… Agatha, this is gorgeous.”</p><p>Agatha seemed to soften then and she leant back against the countertop, watching Rio as she did a once over of the open plan kitchen, her eyes lingering on the breakfast nook just off of it and her breath taken away by the way Agatha had managed to make the space seem cosy, despite being in one of the largest houses on the street, in one of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Los Angeles.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said with a smile that Rio returned when she looked back to her.</p><p>In her admiration of the house, she’d missed taking in Agatha’s appearance, which meant she’d almost forgotten her nerves.</p><p>Agatha now looked at her in a soft grey sweater, wearing light jeans and bare feet, fresh faced with little makeup and her hair up in an effortlessly messy bun, she looked exactly as Rio remembered: beautiful and intoxicating.</p><p>“I,” she started before she could be accused of staring, “I bought some… umm, well,” she shuffled and placed the clean basketball on the marble island beside her, and then fished in her bag.</p><p>“You didn’t need to bring <em>anything</em>,” Agatha clarified, folding her arms loosely across her chest as Rio pulled out her gift.</p><p>“My mom made these last time she was here. Actually, it was whilst we were in Italy. She comes and goes when I’m away just to get away, y’know? Anyway, she makes the best empanadas in the world so…”</p><p>She held up the large tupperware box and for a second felt like the biggest loser on the planet, offering the biggest movie star on the planet a box of her mother’s defrosted empanadas as a gift.</p><p>But Agatha looked touched and stepped forwards to take the box with a gentle smile, “You didn’t need to bring these.”</p><p>“You’re hosting. It’s polite.”</p><p>“It’s too much. I hope you kept some for yourself?”</p><p>“I’ve had a million.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and reached to touch Rio’s arm which sent a jolt of imagined electricity through her body that she wasn’t expecting and Rio flinched a little, playing it off by moving her arm quickly to run through her hair.</p><p>If Agatha noticed, she pretended not to, and went to put the box of empanadas in the large fridge opposite Rio, speaking as she did: “Nicky’s been excited about this since I told him you were coming.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Mm. Apparently I’m not very good and his father…” she trailed off as she closed the door and turned back around, “Well. He’s excited.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and picked her basketball back up again, spinning it in the air before catching it once more. “I can teach you a few things if you like? So you don’t embarrass yourself in front of a seven year old?”</p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha warned with a smile as she made to swipe the ball from Rio’s hands as she threw it up to spin again but Rio was too quick and laughed as Agatha stumbled closer.</p><p>For a second it felt like nothing at all, the two of them, in Agatha’s kitchen, now less than a foot apart. And Rio forgot that she had a crush. She forgot that she couldn’t have Agatha. She forgot everything because she was close once more and looking at her in a way that Rio found she’d missed in their two months apart.</p><p>“Precocious,” Agatha accused with a glint in her eye and Rio hummed, narrowing her gaze a little.</p><p>“Not sure you can be precocious past the age of twelve?”</p><p>But Agatha only laughed a little and instead of trying for the ball again she stepped closer and placed her hands on Rio’s where they held the ball between them.</p><p>Rio sucked in a short sharp breath and Agatha’s brow furrowed just slightly as she watched her, “Come meet Nicky? I promise he’ll be worthy of you.”</p><p>Rio fought the grin for only a moment and then nodded, her fingers twitched beneath Agatha’s and her pinky moving to cross over Agatha’s on her right hand.</p><p>“I’m sure he will be.”</p><p>Blue eyes dropped briefly to where Rio held her little finger and Agatha seemed to hesitate before she pulled away, leading the way out to the backyard with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Rio picked up her tote bag again and followed her out, internally groaning at the hold this woman had on her.</p><p>It was insane to think that she was married to a man. A waste, she thought, as she stepped into the yard with her, and her eyes widened at the sight of it.</p><p>There was a wooden veranda directly off the kitchen with a little seating area with two cushioned chairs and a two-seater armchair. On the little table in the middle of them was a tray with five glasses and what looked like fresh lemonade in a jug and then a bottle of white wine chilling in an ice bucket.</p><p>But the view beyond this was what took Rio’s breath away. The yard was surrounded by tall palms and potted plants that dotted about the space, adding green to the area that housed a large rectangular pool with a smaller hot tub in the middle of it, raised up to create a water fall dropping into the crystal clear water.</p><p>Rio could see hanging lanterns in the trees and saw across the water another seating area with more comfortable chairs and sofas and an awning that gave it privacy and the cosiness she’d felt inside.</p><p>She glanced to the right and saw a built in bar and barbecue area and had to work hard not to let her jaw drop at the sheer opulence of it all.</p><p>“Stop staring,” Agatha said smoothly, turning to Rio with an amused smile, “Really. You’re being very uncool, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Agatha, this-…”</p><p>But she was cut off suddenly by the noise of heavy footsteps coming towards them and the sight of an out of breath little boy shocked Rio back down to reality.</p><p>Nicky.</p><p>He ran beaming towards them and threw himself to his mother’s side, but grinned at Rio as he pressed into Agatha and hid half against her.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said softly, placing a hand on Nicky’s back and gently coaxing him from his hiding place to stand in front of her where she could place her hands on his shoulders and introduce him properly to their guest.</p><p>“Nicky, this is Rio. Rio,” she looked up at Rio with a proud smile, “the best basketball player in all of California, Nicholas Harkness.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes moved from Nicky to Agatha and back again but before she could say anything Nicky had held out his hand to Rio, not saying anything but looking at her expectantly.</p><p>Rio laughed a little at the formality of it but stepped closer and shook his hand, grinning at the heavy up and down motion he provided.</p><p>He had long brown hair, tucked behind his ears and in a loose ponytail, dark hazel eyes and a slightly off-kilter shy smile.</p><p>Agatha had made a cute kid.</p><p>“A pleasure to meet you, Nicky. I hear you’re going to embarrass me quite a bit on the court.”</p><p>“Mama says you’re really good.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio asked with an even wider grin, shooting an amused glance at Agatha before focusing back in on Nicky, “She’s exaggerating. But I have heard that she’s <em>terrible</em> so maybe I’m just better than her?”</p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha said again with a smile at Rio before she bent down to kiss a giggling Nicky on the cheek and murmured, “go pour us all some lemonade and you can play soon, okay?”</p><p>Nicky ran off dutifully and poured the drinks as Rio watched Agatha watch her son.</p><p>“Adorable,” Rio whispered so only Agatha would hear and she turned to her with a gentle smile, tilting her head just a little in acknowledgement before she touched Rio’s arm and stepped over to take a seat on the little couch.</p><p>Nicky settled on one of the chairs and Rio took a seat beside Agatha, placing the ball gently down so it wouldn’t roll away by the table.</p><p>“So,” Rio said officially, keeping her tote bag in her lap and turning her attention to Nicky as he drank from his glass of lemonade.</p><p>“Your mom didn’t tell me which team you supported. Which made bringing you a jersey very difficult.”</p><p>“A jersey?” Nicky asked in surprise, wiping his mouth quickly.</p><p>“Well, a true basketball player has to have a jersey when he plays.”</p><p>“Right,” Nicky said, suddenly serious and watching Rio like she were the Queen of the Basketballers.</p><p>Agatha, on the other end of the couch leant back against the arm, her eyes darting between Nicky’s serious face and Rio’s smiling profile.</p><p>“Now I only bought these just in case because I assume you have one already?”</p><p>“I have a couple.”</p><p>“Good! So what’s your team?”</p><p>Nicky looked concerned for a second, looking to Agatha for help and Agatha leant forward, her hand landing on the couch just beside Rio’s knee.</p><p>“Well, he’s between teams at the moment. I like the Lakers’ purple, his dad likes the Bulls.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and glanced around at Agatha who raised her brows at her, “Something wrong with either of those?”</p><p>But Rio had turned back quickly to Nicky and hummed pensively, pursing her lips. “Which do you like?”</p><p>“I… I don’t know. Both.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said slowly, “both is fine.”</p><p>She was about to follow up when Nicky quickly asked: “Which do you like?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio started with an amused grin, “my team has been the same team since I was about your age.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Celtics,” Rio said as she reached into her tote to pull from it a green jersey. “I liked the green and my dad used to take me to games when he had the time.”</p><p>Nicky nodded seriously and Rio felt the brush of Agatha’s fingers just graze the side of her thigh.</p><p>“I like green too.”</p><p>“You do? Well, I have one other jersey I brought with me. And it’s a special one too because this is my best friend’s team.”</p><p>Rio pulled out the second jersey, holding it up properly for Nicky to take in. “Warriors. She grew up in San Francisco so this is her team.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the navy blue jersey hanging in front of her and then raised her gaze once more to Nicky who seemed to be taking this discussion incredibly seriously and she felt a wave of affection for the little boy.</p><p>“Okay,” he said slowly, glancing across at his mother.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced back at Agatha before focusing back in to Nicky and asking: “Okay? Do you want to wear this one?”</p><p>“No, I…” Nicky hesitated and his eyes went wide for a second as Rio gently dropped the navy blue jersey back into her lap, feeling the silky fabric fall over where Agatha’s hand was, her fingers only just making contact with the skin near the bend of her left knee.</p><p>“Can I wear yours?”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha gasped dramatically, removing her hand from the couch to place across her heart in a theatrical display, “And not your mother’s favourite team? That purple is lovely.”</p><p>Nicky grinned suddenly and Rio snorted as she leant back to look at Agatha, “Name one player on the Lakers.”</p><p>She heard Nicky laugh and from the corner of her eye saw him bounce a little in his seat but kept her gaze on Agatha who pretended to think for a second before she pronounced: “John Smith.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but grinned at Agatha, batting lightly at her arm before she turned to Nicky and picked her green Celtics jersey back up, holding it out to him, “Fine, you can wear this. But just this once, okay? And then when you pick a team I’ll bring you the right colours, alright?”</p><p>“This is my team,” Nicky announced without a second’s hesitation, taking the jersey with a smile.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but didn’t know what to say and simply watched as Nicky slipped the too-large jersey over his t-shirt and grinned down at it.</p><p>A movement on the couch told her that Agatha had moved closer and so she wasn’t surprised when she heard her voice close to her ear, “You’re already more popular than me.”</p><p>Rio fought her laugh just as much has she fought a shiver and turned a little to raise her brows at Agatha, “Seems I’m everyone’s favourite in this household.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her and Rio felt a familiar brush near her side but she anticipated it before Agatha could jab her and she moved quickly, standing from her seat to shrug off her light blue shirt so she was just in her white tank.</p><p>“Okay!” She announced, shoving Alice’s Warrior’s jersey over her head. “Will we go play?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky jumped up and motioned for Rio to follow him. Rio shot Agatha a quick wink as she scooped up the ball and went to follow her new biggest fan to the small patio’d area around the corner.</p><p>She figured she’d be safe for a while if she focused in on Nicky and not on the complicated woman who had just been touching her thigh out of the eyeline of her young son.</p><p>There was a basketball hoop set up on the wall and a discarded ball already laying there at the bottom.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said with a smile as Nicky turned to her and held up his hands to catch the ball, “show me what you got. Take a shot.”</p><p>Nicky caught the ball on the bounce and turned to shoot his shot, missing as it hit the rim and ricocheted off.</p><p>“Close,” Rio reassured, already darting off to fetch the ball as it bounced towards the trees, “again, let’s see those master skills at work.”</p><p>Focusing in on Nicky and keeping his excitement levels up, Rio missed Agatha join them and lean against one of the trees with a glass of wine, her blue eyes darting between her son and the woman entertaining and coaching him.</p><p>And Nicky, though Rio wasn’t at all surprised by this, had clearly inherited all of his mother’s charm. He listened carefully to everything Rio told him, he watched with a seriousness that belied his age, and he grinned with such abandon that Rio wondered if Agatha had ever grinned like that in her life.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her to become fond of him, and clearly Nicky was fond of Rio.</p><p>After an hour or so of playing in the sun, Agatha stepped onto the court and held her hands in the air to stop the game, right when Rio was in the middle of an allstar run.</p><p>“Okay, enough basketball now? Can we all sit down and enjoy a cool drink and some snacks?”</p><p>Rio laughed and Nicky shook his head, “Noooo! We haven’t finished.”</p><p>“One more point,” Rio pleaded teasingly, smiling breathlessly at Agatha where she’d been running around the court like a madman, trying to elicit the feeling for Nicky of being at a real game.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but dropped her hands where they hung in the sky and said in an exasperated tone, “One. Score one more and then done.”</p><p>“Okay, kid. Remember what we just discussed?” Rio shot Nicky a smile and motioned with her head where he should stand, already spinning the ball in her hands.</p><p>Nicky moved obediently and his toothy smile disappeared as he focused in and Rio had to bite her lip to stop from grinning at the change in his expression</p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved yet from the court and so Rio took advantaged of this, bouncing the ball expertly around her, making out like she’d try to take it, and spinning dramatically around her and then bouncing it back to Nicky who caught it easily and turned to aim and shoot.</p><p>He missed, but only just, and Rio was quick to recover the ball and bounce it back to him, this time scooping him up and allowing him to score in an assisted alley-oop.</p><p>When the ball flew through the net, Rio cheered and placed Nicky on her shoulder with a soft grunt of effort and began running with him to Agatha who laughed as loudly as Rio had ever heard it.</p><p>She caught them both, stumbling back a little in surprise but maintaining balance as she helped Rio to balance Nicky and soon stole him from her hold, making a soft noise of exertion as she pulled him down into her own arms and spun him around.</p><p>“A regular John Smith!”</p><p>Rio laughed and clutched her stomach as she caught her breath, beaming at the mother and son duo as Agatha halted her spin and let Nicky drop to his feet.</p><p>“Are you doing that on purpose?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked with an innocent smile, “He’s the best player.”</p><p>Rio was so exhausted that she couldn’t bring herself to argue and instead smiled widely at Agatha, only looking away when an excited seven year old threw himself at her and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>Rio released a quiet ‘oomph’ at the sudden smack to her body but quickly dropped down to hug Nicky properly, laughing as he held on tight, his arms now around her neck.</p><p>“Come play again?” He asked quietly into Rio’s ear and Rio nodded gently, feeling strangely emotional about the request.</p><p>“Sure. Whenever you want.”</p><p>She pulled back only when Nicky did and saw in his face the return of his shyness that Agatha had told her about all those weeks ago back in the pool.</p><p>He didn’t quite meet her gaze again as he ran off to where the lemonade was and Rio was left standing with Agatha, feeling clammy and tired in the late-afternoon sun.</p><p>“You’re good with kids,” Agatha said softly, watching Rio with a kind of tenderness that made Rio want to turn away and hide from.</p><p>“I… probably just kids who like basketball. Or any other sports, maybe. Mostly basketball.”</p><p>She shrugged a little self-consciously and rubbed the back of her neck, mortified to feel that it actually was a little clammy and clearing her throat as she turned to where Nicky had run off to.</p><p>“He’s a good kid. You should be-…”</p><p>But her words died the instant she felt Agatha’s hands on hers and she turned suddenly to see Agatha close, holding her left hand in both of her own.</p><p>Rio felt something swell in her chest and couldn’t fight it as whatever the feeling was made her right hand move to rest over Agatha’s too, her eyes wide as she took in the face before her, wondering how she’d gone so long without being able to look at it.</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha instructed softly, not exactly a demand, not exactly a request. “Have dinner with us.”</p><p>Rio could only nod once, her mind a mysterious blank where it had just been firing on all cylinders, buoyed by the enjoyment of the exercise.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched ever so slightly and Rio felt her whole world stop as she leant in to her.</p><p>It must be what it felt like to die, she thought. Everything slow, everything wonderful.</p><p>As if she couldn’t take it in properly, her eyes fluttered closed and it was in the darkness that she felt Agatha’s lips against her skin for the first time in weeks.</p><p>Her cheek was flushed and she was sure it was a little sticky with the sweat from the past hour or so she’d been pulling out all the stops for Nicky in the Los Angeles sun.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t recoiled. She’d pressed her lips to Rio’s cheek like she’d meant to do it, like she’d meant to anchor there for longer than would be considered a greeting in a European country or a friendly exchange between two movie stars.</p><p>But it couldn’t last forever.</p><p>And so Agatha pulled back and when she did, Rio’s eyes fluttered open and she turned her head ever so slightly towards her, seeking more of her warmth, wanting more.</p><p>As Rio moved and Agatha pulled back so slowly that Rio could have counted every freckle, their noses brushed and Rio sucked in sharp breath that caused the spell to be broken and for Agatha to pull away entirely.</p><p>Their eyes met and Rio saw that Agatha’s were darker than usual, her pupils swallowing the usual blue of her irises. Her lips were parted and her cheeks were flushed and Rio’s brain short-circuited when she saw where Agatha’s gaze was.</p><p>And then the world righted itself.</p><p>There was a shout.</p><p>A greeting.</p><p>A man’s voice.</p><p>Ralph was home.</p>

<p>Ralph.</p><p>Rio had forgotten about the husband.</p><p>In all the work she’d put into convincing herself that she only wanted Agatha because she couldn’t have her, she’d forgotten about the main reason she couldn’t have her.</p><p>Her gaze fell from Agatha’s suddenly panicked eyes to the joined hands between them and she hesitated for a second before she pulled away, taking a step back and clearing her throat.</p><p>“Ralph?” She asked needlessly, watching as Agatha’s panic morphed to something different and she’d turned from her to march around to where Nicky had gone.</p><p>“He wasn’t supposed to be here.”</p><p>Rio felt suddenly like a spare part, no, like a mistress.</p><p>Without the obvious benefits.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair and awkwardly patted her jersey down, though really there was nothing she could do to make herself look more presentable as she followed Agatha back around the house to where her husband had clearly arrived.</p><p>She was ashamed of herself but for what, she couldn’t really fathom. Maybe lustful thought, but those she’d had about various people since she was a teenage. Maybe that she’d half convinced herself that Agatha might return them.</p><p>Maybe because she thought if Ralph hadn’t arrived Agatha might have kissed her.</p><p>Waiting for them by the outdoor sitting area was a tall man with a dark sweep of hair that Rio recognised immediately as the surface-level polite husband of the woman she’d prefer to have all to herself.</p><p>A Clark Kent-type without the glasses and not for the first time Rio couldn’t help but see how someone, inclined to men, could fall for him. Which made it worse. But then maybe Rio wasn’t cruel enough to wish Agatha were married to an ugly man.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>A red-blooded American finance bro with a strong jaw and a winning smile.</p><p>And Rio stood, a Puerto-Rican American woman with a basketball jersey that wasn’t hers and a light sheen of sweat across her brow.</p><p>Who would ever pick her?</p><p>Ralph turned to Agatha from where he’d been sat in the place Rio had been only an hour or so ago and gestured to their son, “Celtics? Really?”</p><p>Rio hated this guy.</p><p>“It’s my team,” Nicky said quietly and Rio shot him a reassuring wink as she stopped beside Agatha.</p><p>“I thought you’d be out all night,” Agatha said with such a lack of warmth that Rio turned to look at her, taken aback by this display.</p><p>“I came home to change,” Ralph said distractedly, now eyeing Rio as he stood and moved to offer her a hand, “Hi. Rio, right? You look different to the last time I saw you?”</p><p><em>Yeah, I’ve not been sat through hair and makeup for the last three hours you fucking asshole.</em></p><p>Rio shook the hand offered to her, refusing to look away from the man who so clearly wanted to say ‘you look much worse’.</p><p>“It’s amazing what a team of makeup artists and hair dressers can do.”</p><p>Ralph smiled a little and glanced at Rio’s jersey, guessing correctly, “so you’re the basketball influencer?”</p><p>“I just came over to test my skills against Nicky’s.”</p><p>She leant round slightly, and shot the boy a smile before looking back up to Ralph, almost daring him to say something.</p><p>The man seemed disinterested though, or else, already smug that whatever he thought the battle was, he’d won.</p><p>He had Agatha after all.</p><p>But Agatha interjected and moved just enough in front of Rio that Ralph had no choice but to turn to her instead, “You should hurry if you want to make your dinner reservations. Especially if you want a drink beforehand.”</p><p>“Actually,” Ralph said with a raise of his brows, looking past his wife and to Rio, “A lot of the guys in the office are fans of yours. I didn’t get to ask in Cannes and this might be a little strange but… mind if I get a selfie? They’d shit themselves if they-…”</p><p>Agatha had cleared her throat.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth and then closed it again, surprised by the request. But she couldn’t think of an excuse quickly enough to deny it so she simply nodded her assent and surreptitiously tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Excellent,” Ralph grinned and Rio once again saw what Agatha must find attractive in him. He had a boyish charm.</p><p>Superman in a suit.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said suddenly in a tone much softer than the one she’d used with Ralph earlier, “why don’t you go to your room? You can have an hour on your Switch before dinner, okay?”</p><p>Rio looked on as Nicky beamed and disappeared before the offer could be rescinded and Rio smiled a little at the sight, thinking that having been within Ralph’s presence for collectively less than twenty minutes she already couldn’t see any of him in his son.</p><p>And Ralph paid his son absolutely no mind as he reached over to pour himself a glass of wine, only pouring one for Rio and Agatha too when Agatha cleared her throat pointedly again and the man remembered his manners. “Excuse me, should be ladies first.”</p><p>“Where are you from?” Rio asked suddenly, accepting the glass offered to her without a thank you and trying her hardest to remain polite when all she wanted to do was run away.</p><p>“Dallas, originally. Moved to Chicago when I was a kid.”</p><p>“Hence the Bulls?”</p><p>Ralph smiled and thanked the universe that she was, fortunately, immune to his charms.</p><p>“Yes. Where exactly did my son get the idea in his head that Celtics was the way to go?”</p><p>“That would be me.”</p><p>Ralph took such a large gulp of his wine that made Rio raise her brows a little but he only nodded once he’d swallowed it down, “I suppose you can’t force a team on a kid. He’ll pick his own one day.”</p><p>“So,” he said suddenly, before Rio had even had a chance to take a sip of her wine, “selfie and then I’ll be on my way.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and shot Agatha a quick glance and in seeing that she looked a little paler than usual she decided she didn’t mind doing this quick favour to get this man as far away as possible.</p><p>She shuffled to the edge of the couch and placed her glass down, and paused momentarily where Ralph had scuffed his chair along the stone slabs to push it back to the couch, holding his arm out behind him for Rio to slip into.</p><p>But Agatha had stood up before Rio made to move.</p><p>“Let me take it.”</p><p>Rio glanced around and saw that Agatha looked furious, her hand held out for Ralph’s phone, her fingers already twitching in a ‘give it to me’ motion.</p><p>“You’re the boss,” Ralph said in a tone that made Rio want to hit him.</p><p>But he stood and Rio stood too, allowing him to drape his arm around her waist and pull her closer than she’d have liked.</p><p>He smelled like expensive after shave and a hint of whiskey and Rio fought hard to force a smile when in interactions like these they usually came so easily.</p><p>But her gaze met Agatha’s above the phone she held to take the photo and when it did she felt the heavy weight of reality.</p><p>This was Agatha’s home.</p><p>This was Agatha’s husband.</p><p>Agatha took just one photo of the two of them and Rio decided she didn’t want to see what it looked like but she could bet she looked sweaty and uninterested in it.</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said as he held the phone back out to her husband, and Ralph took it with one hand, his other still on Rio’s waist.</p><p>Rio moved from his hold and went to stand a little further away, which Ralph didn’t object to, and Rio realised that he’d been holding her as if it were his right but that he had no real knowledge of his own actions: he was simply a man who was used to having a pretty woman on his arm.</p><p>But that didn’t sit well with her and apparently not Agatha either who’d moved around to take Rio’s hand and tug her in the direction of the lone armchair opposite where Nicky had been sitting.</p><p>Rio moved without question or thought and even sat down, looking up at Agatha as though to expect more instruction, but they never came.</p><p>“They’ll love this,” Ralph was saying with that same charming grin across his face.</p><p>“Really.” He turned to Rio and held his phone up like a trophy even with Agatha now standing between the two of them like an armed guard. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, smiling a little at the type of man who would consider the look on her face in the photo to be a ‘grin’ from a pretty girl and she brushed her hands down the tops of her thighs slowly as she watched Ralph turn back to his phone and broadcast the picture to anyone and everyone he thought would be impressed by it.</p><p>“Rio, Nicky, and I were going to have dinner,” Agatha said firmly, still standing between Rio and her husband, “I assume you’ll be back later?”</p><p>“Actually,” Ralph turned with that same, brilliant grin, “I might stay out with the boys. That okay, hon?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said with a kind of shrug, and Rio watched as Ralph leant in and placed a firm kiss to Agatha’s cheek, making a ‘mwah’ sound that Rio would have thought Agatha would hate but she didn’t respond at all.</p><p>Ralph then turned and threw the rest of his wine down his throat, wincing ever so slightly and then turning to smile at Rio, back to his charming self.</p><p>“Nice to see you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio barely had a chance to wave before the man had turned on his heel and disappeared back into the house.</p><p>It was strange. Being suddenly confronted again with the person the subject of your months-long fascination had chosen to be with.</p><p>Because Rio wouldn’t have picked Ralph for Agatha.</p><p>She’d known that the first time she met him. She knew that now.</p><p>Sure, he was handsome, seemingly harmless though a bit obtuse, but there wasn’t much substance to him, no real personality past the cookie cutter mould he’d been carved out of.</p><p>But who was Rio to say it didn’t work. She’d been told for weeks now how ‘happily married’ Agatha was.</p><p>And maybe Agatha turned a blind eye to Ralph who sometimes looked at other women, maybe sometimes touched.</p><p>But all evidence pointed the way of a happy, functioning marriage: a cute, well-adjusted kid, a great house. What else was there?</p><p>And Rio, single and pining, was hardly a good judge of who was made for each other and who wasn’t.</p><p>So Agatha maybe flirted a little, she was a movie star, she was built to be charming to everyone. And Rio just so happened to be charmed by everything she did.</p><p>With Ralph now disappeared upstairs to change, Rio turned her attention back to Agatha and saw that she was still standing, and she reached for her hand that was nearest to her, tugging lightly at it to pull her to sit just as Agatha had done to her earlier.</p><p>Agatha allowed this and slowly sat down on the couch and reached with her free hand for her wine, taking a sip before she spoke, “Sorry, he’s just… busy with work and he doesn’t get a lot of time to blow off steam so…”</p><p>Rio recognised an excuse when she saw one and gently turned Agatha’s hand over in her own two, interlinking their fingers together without saying anything for a while.</p><p>“He’s handsome. Very handsome.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed lightly and when Rio looked up from their joined hands she saw Agatha was looking at her.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked quietly, a small smile tugging at her lips, “You think just because I like girls I can’t recognise a handsome man?”</p><p>“No, I just…” Agatha sighed and Rio’s smile faded as she shifted in her seat to watch Agatha.</p><p>“What? Think I have bad taste?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and turned to Rio properly, her smile not quite reaching her eyes as she gazed across at her, “I don’t know anything about your taste.”</p><p>“It’s good,” Rio said, “I promise you that.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something but closed it again almost as quickly and Rio wriggled her brows at her, attempting to get her eyes to light up again as they had on the basketball court.</p><p>“I’ll have to take your word for it.”</p><p>Agatha had whispered the words and Rio looked away suddenly for fear she’d see something in her gaze she’d never recover from. She felt dizzy with her need for Agatha, unsure how this had happened again when she’d entered the house so determined to keep a hold on herself and her emotions.</p><p>There was a beat.</p><p>A silence.</p><p>And then Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand, afterwards pulling her own away for fear she was overstepping.</p><p>Agatha allowed it but dropped her gaze to where Rio had placed her arm on the arm of the chair and offered suddenly: “You want to take a shower?”</p><p>“Oh? Do I smell?”</p><p>“No, I just-…”</p><p>And Rio looked up to meet blue eyes again and she bit down on her lip, watching as Agatha’s gaze flew briefly to her lower lip now pulled between her teeth.</p><p>It must have been a trick of the light, a misfire of her brain, because as soon as she thought she saw it, it was gone. Agatha’s gaze was back meeting her own and she was smiling slightly, “You’re maybe just a little sweatier than when you first arrived.”</p><p>“Just a little?”</p><p>Rio lifted her arm and made a show of smelling her armpit and Agatha laughed properly this time, and when Rio looked back at her she looked more relaxed.</p><p>But it lasted all of two seconds.</p><p>“Hon?”</p><p>Ralph had appeared back in the door, gazing over at his wife in a new clean, crisp outfit that looked very similar to the one he’d been wearing before.</p><p>Rio pulled her arm down quickly, a little mortified that she’d been caught out trying to impress his wife in the most juvenile way possible.</p><p>“My uber’s here. I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio felt her heart leap to her chest when Agatha stood from her seat and went to kiss Ralph’s cheek. And her treacherous brain told her that Agatha hadn’t kissed her like that. She’d been softer, lingering longer, had pulled back slower.</p><p>She dropped her gaze and reached for her wine.</p><p>She didn’t look up again until she heard Agatha sit down on the couch and even then she didn’t look Agatha’s way, just glancing up to where Ralph had previously been.</p><p>“Offer’s there,” Agatha said as if they hadn’t just been interrupted, “if you want to shower, you can.”</p><p>“I didn’t bring anything to change into,” Rio said, more shyly than she usually would and she caught Agatha’s gaze then, seeing her tongue dart out to wet her lips and feeling the dull blankness of her mind as she watched it retreat back into her mouth.</p><p>“I have clothes. A whole closet full.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze then and wondered how long she could tolerate this. How long she could possibly spend being friendly with Agatha when all she could think about was kissing her.</p><p>All the time. Constantly. Forever.</p><p>“Then sure, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and Rio put her wine back down to follow Agatha through the house. She took the time to look around, seeing things she’d missed before when they’d walked through to the kitchen then out to the back.</p><p>There were little photos of Nicky dotted about everywhere and pictures of Agatha with him, but Rio was yet to spot a picture of Ralph.</p><p>Just as she was wondering why that was, she collided into Agatha’s back as they reached the top of the stairs.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows as Rio straightened herself out and motioned to a door to the right on the large landing.</p><p>“Use the guest bathroom. Ralph will have just used ours so… you’ll find clean towels on the side and use whatever you want. I’ll find some clothes and leave them just outside for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, suddenly feeling shy again and wondering whether this was a good idea.</p><p>But she’d committed already and it would look weird if she bailed so she shot Agatha a quick smile before she turned to disappear into the bathroom.</p><p>The room was large, pristine, and Rio resisted the urge to search through Agatha’s cabinets.</p><p>She didn’t want to dawdle so she stripped herself quickly of her clothes and stepped into the walk in shower, and after a few attempts got the waterfall head to turn on at just the right temperature.</p><p>She lathered herself in Agatha’s expensive soaps and washed her hair with shampoo and conditioner with fancy french names on a monochrome label.</p><p>Everything was expensive, everything felt and smelled incredible and Rio had to actively not think that soon she would smell like Agatha, and soon she would be wearing Agatha’s clothes.</p><p>But as she stepped out she had a horrifying realisation.</p><p>She was clean, fresh, and she now had two options: she either wore Agatha’s clothes with underwear she’d already worn that day, or she went commando.</p><p>Neither were good.</p><p>But she dried herself, squeezing as much water from her damp hair as possible with the plush white towel, and soon wrapped herself in it to open the door and look for the clothes that Agatha had promised to leave.</p><p>Sitting in a neat little pile was a light green cashmere sweater and white linen pants.</p><p>Celtics colours.</p><p>She smiled to herself as she pulled them inside and put them on.</p><p>She could smell Agatha’s fabric conditioner on them, and she checked herself over in the mirror, seeing herself reflected in Agatha’s clothes. Maybe the universe had a sense of humour because this wasn’t exactly how she’d fantasied about getting into Agatha’s pants.</p><p>She folded her old clothes up and left the bathroom with them, making sure to place her used towel in the laundry basket to the side.</p><p>When she went back down to find Agatha she saw the little table and chairs empty and looked around to find her.</p><p>Across the pool Agatha was sitting below the awning, smiling across at her and waving at her to make sure she’d spotted her.</p><p>It was almost too much to bear. Too domestic and easy.</p><p>But Rio placed her sweaty clothes in her tote bag and left it on the side to go and join Agatha in the more private part of the yard.</p><p>“A change of scenery?”</p><p>“It’s nicer under here when it gets a little darker,” Agatha said with a shrug, her gaze roaming over the sight of Rio before her in her clothes.</p><p>“Like the colour choice?”</p><p>“Subtle,” Rio said with a grin, taking a seat opposite Agatha in on of the little armchairs.</p><p>Agatha just hummed and reached over to pour some wine for Rio, leaning across to hold it out to her.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen Nicky take to someone so quickly.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever taken to a kid so quickly as I did to him.”</p><p>Agatha bit on her lower lip and dropped her gaze to her own wine glass, swirling it slowly before her.</p><p>“Ever think about having kids of your own?”</p><p>Rio paused before she answered, wondering how honest she wanted to be.</p><p>“I’d have to find a woman first.”</p><p>“Wanda doesn’t want kids?”</p><p>Rio blinked, unsure she’d heard Agatha correctly. She tilted her head and remained silent until Agatha looked back up at her, “What?”</p><p>“I… I’m not dating Wanda, Agatha. Do you think I am?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged slightly, her eyes back down on her wine glass, “I saw you guys at the roundtable and I thought… maybe… and then at Venice you were-…”</p><p>“On the boat?” Rio asked with a frown, “We hung out together because Alice knew I was miserable and exhausted and needed a friend nearby.”</p><p>“They got pictures of you together out at a restaurant. Holding hands.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe what she was hearing. If holding hands with someone was all it took for Agatha to think they were dating then she must have considered her and Rio married five times over by now.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said gently, unable to get a hold on Agatha’s feelings about this.</p><p><em>Goddamn Best Actress</em>, she thought.</p><p>“Those photos were taken at a dinner with me, Wanda, and Alice. They just didn’t get Alice because she was beside me. And…,” she added with a little smile: “she’s little.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted back up then and she looked at Rio for a second before she said: “I just assumed…”</p><p>“We’re just friends.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and Rio smiled a little, chewing her lip as she watched the cogs turn in Agatha’s mind and once again she found herself wishing she could unwind them, read what they were saying.</p><p>“But yes, if I found the right person, I’d want a family.”</p><p>It was a half-truth. The unspoken part of it being that right now, sitting in Agatha’s clothes, in her house, with her son upstairs, she wanted <em>this</em> family. Husband excluded.</p><p>“You’d be a good mom,” Agatha offered, and Rio saw that she’d drifted somewhere again, somewhere where Rio wouldn’t be able to reach her until she came back to herself.</p><p>“As good as you, I’d hope.”</p><p>Agatha laughed a little, “You’ve barely seen me as a mom.”</p><p>“But I know you as a woman. I’ve seen enough of Nicky to know he’s all you. There’s none of Ralph in him.”</p><p><em>Thank god</em>, Rio added for herself.</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised slowly and Rio could see that she was fighting off a small smile, “You think?”</p><p>“Practically a mini-you. Minus the attitude and the poor ball skills, of course.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile really hit then but she was rolling her eyes, tucking her legs beneath her on the couch. “Well now I don’t need to improve my skills because I have you.”</p><p>“Oh? Is that what this is? Pimping me out to your son for basketball practice? I’ll have you know I’m soon to win an Oscar.”</p><p>“Winning now, are you?”</p><p>“Best believe it, Harkness. Alice thinks you’ve secured me a good few votes with your public announcement of my being your favourite actress. She said Jen was pissed.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, “She got over it.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Well, I’m pretty sure after a few heated phone calls with your manager she had to relent for fear she’d lose Alice.”</p><p>“That would never happen,” Rio said with her full chest, so certain that Alice was in it for the long haul with Jen. “Did she tell you they said ‘I love you’ last night?”</p><p>“She did.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and adjusted herself in her seat, resting her free arm along the arm of the chair, “Maybe they’ll have a kid.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure Jen likes Nicky despite her protestations sometimes. Maybe they will.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, wondering if this was a conversation Jen and Alice had already had because Alice was a big softy with babies.</p><p>“It’s hard not to like him.”</p><p>“Because he’s so like me?”</p><p>Rio laughed and reached for a chip from the large bowl in the centre of the table between them, “Sure, tell yourself that.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and took a sip of her wine before swirling it and looking off to the little basketball court in the distance, just about making out the net from where she sat.</p><p>“I mean it though, you can come over whenever you want, if you want. Nicky would be thrilled.”</p><p>“See, another issue on the whole kid thing,” Rio said, ignoring the warm feeling in her chest that came from the open invitation. “After this week I’m away again.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“In Toronto for about three months. Press in between.”</p><p>Rio saw in Agatha’s gaze such a look of such shock that she thought she was imagining it.</p><p>But it disappeared quickly and Agatha cleared her throat, “See when you have kids you have to pick and choose carefully… I’m shooting in Studio City for around four months, starting in about three weeks.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, her tongue sticking into the inside of her cheek as she watched Agatha’s gaze fall to her wine again.</p><p>“Anything good?” She asked lamely, feeling as though the bubble had burst somehow.</p><p>“It’s just a tv thing. A limited series based on <em>Heartburn</em>.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, and sat up a little more, “I forgot. I read that you’d got that. I auditioned, you know.”</p><p>“Too young,” Agatha quipped with a grin and tilted her glass to Rio in a pseudo-toast, “That role needs experience.”</p><p>“Ah yes, I always forget I’m talking to an old woman. Tell me, how’re the aches and pains today?”</p><p>“I could run rings around you, Vidal.”</p><p>“I don’t know. Weren’t doing much running earlier.”</p><p>“It’s cute that you think you’re cute.”</p><p>“Making me cute, no?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head to the side and gave Agatha her best grin, placing her hand underneath her chin. Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled and shuffled a little in her seat, “So irritating.”</p><p>“Hey, I just provided an hour’s worth of free childcare for you. <em>And</em> a selfie for your husband. I usually charge for those, you know.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile fell slightly, “Yeah, I’m sorry about that. You didn’t have to.”</p><p>“It’s okay. Happens.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio took the opportunity to take another large sip of wine, deciding she wasn’t drunk enough to be able to hold a proper conversation about Ralph.</p><p>“He is a good dad,” Agatha said suddenly, making Rio almost choke where she’d gone to take another sip.</p><p>“I mean,” Agatha clarified, watching Rio with a slight frown when she was now recovering from her choking by taking another sip of the very thing that had choked her in the first place.</p><p>“He loves Nicky.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure that loving a child was all it took to be a ‘good dad’ but she also wasn’t sure she was in any position to judge, mostly because given the chance she’d insult Ralph for days - whether he deserved it or not.</p><p>“Okay,” she said quietly, unsure how to respond or what Agatha was trying to say.</p><p>Agatha took her own large gulp of her wine and then reached for the bottle to top Rio up again, “Oh. No,” Rio said quickly, coming to her senses just in time to stop Agatha from filling her glass, “I need to drive home. I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha said suddenly, holding the bottle up and raising her gaze to Rio’s, watching her closely.</p><p>And without thinking Rio simply nodded, and removed the hand that hovered over her glass to allow Agatha to refill it.</p><p>When it was done she raised her gaze to meet cautious blue eyes and she took a slow breath in before she said: “This dinner on Friday… this opportunity for a double date plus me… I’m assuming Ralph is coming?”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze and nodded as she filled her own glass and put the bottle back in the ice bucket. “Yeah, he’ll be here.”</p><p>Rio nodded too and sat back slowly in her seat, “I’m trying to think of excuses to get out of it.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha asked suddenly, a deep frown marring her features at this news.</p><p>“I’ll be the fifth wheel, I’m not exactly looking forward to sitting with two couples.”</p><p>Maybe the wine had made her say it, and Rio would have been embarrassed but mostly she was just glad she hadn’t said the real truth of it: “I don’t want to see you with Ralph.”</p><p>But Agatha said something next that made Rio worry she’d said the bad part out loud.</p><p>“Then I’ll make sure Ralph’s at the top of the table. You can sit with me.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to ask how this might make a difference but closed it again when Agatha held out her hand to her, making a bridge between the couch and the chair.</p><p>“It’ll be good, I promise.”</p><p>And Agatha wriggled her fingers because Rio was yet to take her hand. And she only didn’t for a few seconds longer because she enjoyed seeing Agatha work for it, her fingers dancing expectantly towards the sky.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll turn up. Maybe without any basketball jerseys this time.”</p><p>She reached across and took Agatha’s hand, smiling when her fingers wrapped around her own.</p><p>“About that…” Agatha said absently, looking down at their joined hands. “I spoke to Nicky whilst you were showering. He’s pretty set on Celtic.”</p><p>“Celtics,” Rio corrected with a raised brow, “Does this mean I’ve lost my jersey?”</p><p>“I’ll buy you another.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio said with a smirk, “The thing is, I don’t even mind because they’re the best team in the world so I’m glad to have been such a good influence.”</p><p>“If you wanted to have a word with him about bed times and brushing his teeth, that would be good for me too.”</p><p>“I don’t believe that Nicky has any problem with either of those things.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, her gaze still down on their hands and her thumb now brushing idly in a way that made Rio yearn for her, as pathetic as she was.</p><p>“No, maybe not. I lucked out with him.”</p><p>“I think it’s more than luck,” Rio said kindly, shaking Agatha’s hand gently to try to get her to look up at her, “you must have had some influence in there along the way.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha smiled coyly, raising her gaze to Rio. “Just wanted to hear you say it again.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pulled her hand away suddenly, staring at Agatha in faux-horror, “Fishing for compliments? A woman who gets truck loads every waking hour?”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha protested, and whether because Rio had taken her hand back or because she was accusing her, she didn’t know. “Parenting compliments are different.”</p><p>“Agatha, who meets that kid and <em>doesn’t</em> compliment your parenting skills?”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and made a motion with her hand to get Rio to give hers back but Rio wilfully ignored it, deciding it was for her own good more than anything. Because the next time she was over, she certainly wouldn’t be able to hold Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Just doesn’t hurt to hear it, that’s all.”</p><p>Her fingers stopped dancing and she held her palm flat out, reaching for just one more second before she pulled it back in.</p><p>Rio considered this for a second, considered the implications of it, and wondered where it had happened that they were fine with just holding hands whilst talking over wine.</p><p>It was new, for sure. Perhaps it was just a fluke. Perhaps Agatha were drunker than she realised, and maybe she was too.</p><p>Or perhaps, just perhaps, Agatha had missed her, had just been told she potentially wasn’t going to see her again for a few months and… she was making up for lost time.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t let herself do it.</p><p>Agatha had gone silent too and something settled between them that Rio couldn’t name but that made her not want to break it for fear they would have to broach a topic that neither of them were ready for.</p><p>And it was true soon enough, but the peace broke in a way that Rio didn’t mind: the return of Nicky.</p><p>The noise of the boy running to them made Agatha shift in her seat and them both to turn to watch his entrance and Rio had to fight a laugh where he was still wearing his brand new, old Celtics jersey.</p><p>“It’s been an hour,” he announced with a sheepish smile and Rio raised her brows around at Agatha, shocked that this kid would be so honest when he probably could have got away with another few hours playing his games if Rio had anything to do with it.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said with an easy smile, pulling Nicky closer to lean against the couch so she could lean up and kiss his temple, watching Rio from where she now rested her chin on his shoulder.</p><p>“Dinner, then?”</p><p>“Dinner,” Rio and Nicky agreed at the same time and Agatha’s smile widened before she let her son go to chase down to the kitchen.</p><p>Rio stood and smiled at Agatha as she matched her movements, glancing around to check Nicky was gone before she lowered her voice and said: “Whatever you did in a past life to deserve that kid, well done.”</p><p>Agatha only rolled her eyes but Rio saw her proud smile and she laughed as she grabbed the bucket of wine from the table, “You couldn’t be more smug if you tried.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m allowed to be proud of my son.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>Agatha followed Rio down the path, around the pool, and back up to the house. And, once inside, Rio placed the bucket down and leant up against the island in the middle of the grand kitchen.</p><p>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</p><p>“Music duty?” Agatha asked with a thrown smile over her shoulder as she turned the faucet on to wash her hands.</p><p>“Music I can do.”</p><p>Rio pulled out her phone from the tote bag just outside the back door and noticed a few new unread messages but scrolled past them as she went to take a seat beside Nicky at the island.</p><p>“What do you like, kid? Jazz? You seem like a jazz kinda guy.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and Nicky laughed with a scrunch of his nose, “No! Something fun. Rock!”</p><p>“Rock?” Rio asked with an amused smile, scrolling through her playlists until she came across something that would surely do the trick.</p><p>“Okay, Fleetwood Mac it is. Classic. Excellent. Rock.”</p><p>After some fumbling, she connected it to the bluetooth speaker and watched Nicky’s face as the first chords of the guitar kicked in and Lindsey Buckingham’s voice filled the kitchen.</p><p>“You are so cheesy,” Agatha said from the other side of the island where she was chopping garlic.</p><p>“Fleetwood Mac are <em>not</em> cheesy. How dare you.”</p><p>Agatha just rolled her eyes and Rio grinned at her. And something took over suddenly, her desire to show off or her desire to have Agatha’s attention again. Maybe she just wanted Nicky to like her.</p><p>But she slipped from her stool and began to sing along with Lindsey, hamming it up as best she could.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha protested, but Rio had stolen a wooden spoon from the nearby utensils pot and began to belt out the lyrics with abandon.</p><p>“Nicky!” She shouted, gesturing for him to jump up and join and for a second he looked too shy to jump up and do it but then the chorus kicked in and Rio really went for it around a still protesting Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve not had enough wine for this.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio grinned, tugging her arm to pull her from the chopping board and draping her arm around her neck so they were cheek to cheek and Agatha had access to the wooden spoon now masquerading as a mic.</p><p>And Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio, which made Rio’s heart race, and for just a second she’d turned her face around and pressed into Rio’s cheek.</p><p>It made Rio stutter as she sang and she lost all sense of the lyrics for the time Agatha was pressing against her but by the next line it was done and Rio turned to look wide eyed at Agatha, singing as she did: “Open up, everything’s waiting for you…”</p><p>Agatha still had her arms around Rio, resting her hands on her left hip, Rio’s side flush against Agatha’s front.</p><p>And there, in the breath between the verse and the chorus, Rio knew that Alice had been wrong. That ‘happily married’ wasn’t true. That Agatha wanted her maybe as much as she wanted Agatha.</p><p>Her father had been right all those years ago when he’d told her that rock and roll music was the thinking man’s Jesus Christ.</p><p>But Agatha’s lips were moving and she was relenting to the pull of the song and shouting with Rio now into the mic as the chorus kicked up again.</p><p>His mother joining in was all Nicky needed.</p><p>And soon the three of them were bellowing “YOU CAN GO YOUR OWN WAY” into the mic, Rio making sure everyone got equal opportunities to share the spoon.</p><p>Agatha was now only holding onto her with one arm, her other had pulled Nicky into the fold and Rio felt sick with it, sick with the ease in which the three of them huddled together and sung their hearts out.</p><p>This borrowed little family for the night was all it would ever be.</p><p>Even if Agatha might want her too. Even if she continued to hold her hand and touch her leg.</p><p>This wasn’t hers to keep.</p><p>As the first guitar solo kicked in, Rio’s rational mind overtook and she pulled away to give herself over to the sacred art of air guiltar.</p><p>Agatha was unwilling to join in so two guitarists would have to do.</p><p>Her and Nicky tore it up around her and Rio felt the familiar flush of an adoring audience admiring her, though this particular audience was made of just one.</p><p>“I hate theatre kids,” Agatha mumbled as she fell back against the counter and laughed at the sight before her, shaking her head in disbelief as the song drew to a close and Rio was back on her again, mic at the ready.</p><p>“No, not again!”</p><p>“You can go your own way!” Both Rio and Nicky sang, both grabbing at Agatha who now had two maniacs in her arms once more.</p><p>Rio was laughing too much for the next guitar solo and Nicky fully went for it, throwing his long hair about the place that Rio had to applaud him as he did so, trying to ignore that Agatha had draped her arms around her middle and was laughing into her shoulder.</p><p>But she leant back into it, her mic-less hand resting above Agatha’s, and the only thing that could break them apart, would ever make Rio pull away from being held like this, was Nicky as he finished the song with a fist in the air and a brilliant, proud grin.</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s middle and then moved around her to place a firm kiss to her son’s pink cheeks and beamed down at him.</p><p>“My little rockstar.”</p><p>Rio grinned as she leant against the island and caught her breath, horrified that she could be so out of it after just one song when she’d been more than capable of running around the basketball court for an hour in the hot sun earlier.</p><p><em>Wine</em>, she thought idly, but her gaze drifted across to Agatha and she wondered if she was another reason she felt breathless.</p><p>She chewed on her lip to stop herself from getting carried away again with thoughts that would send her over the cliff edge until she felt a hand on her stomach and she looked up just as Agatha kissed her cheek sweetly.</p><p>“Goofy,” she whispered close to Rio’s ear and grinned at her as she pulled away, her hand moving round to the safety of Rio’s side when Nicky moved back around again and jumped on the stool.</p><p>“We should do that before dinner every night.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks were now flushed for a different reason but she turned around to smile at Nicky and raised her brows, feeling a soft touch at the small of her back before Agatha pulled away entirely to focus back in on the meal prep.</p><p>“I think your mom would love that. You can pick a different song every night and sing it together.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha muttered quietly, and Rio turned to raise her brows at Agatha, challenging her to it.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I can kick you out, you know.”</p><p>“But you won’t,” Rio grinned, turning where she stood to lean her back on the counter again, and reaching across Agatha to get her wine.</p><p>Agatha only huffed but returned to her meal prep, occasionally adding to the conversation where Rio and Nicky mostly spoke about basketball and occasionally soccer.</p><p>By the time dinner was made, a prawn linguine, with chilli on the side so Nicky didn’t have to have it, and it was presented in a large bowl in the middle of the table in the breakfast nook, Rio had decided that Nicky was the best kid she’d ever met.</p><p>And Agatha, well she knew how she felt about Agatha.</p><p>And sitting here, at the little table with her son, half a bottle of wine in her system, and Agatha’s knee every so often knocking into her own, was enough to confirm it.</p><p>It hadn’t been this a silly vacation one-sided infatuation. She’d fallen for hypnotic blue eyes and soft, secret touches. She’d fallen for Agatha Harkness, totally and utterly, and she now believed, despite Alice’s voice ringing in her ears, that Agatha might have fallen too.</p><p>Rio couldn’t quite wrap her head around the fact that in her place, on any given night, Ralph would be sitting here, as close to Agatha as she were, more than likely closer.</p><p>But Agatha’s touches were getting bolder, always hidden from Nicky’s sights.</p><p>The knee that had been previously just brushing her own was now pressed against it.</p><p>Her hand, when she placed her fork down and declared she was so full she couldn’t eat anything else, not even ice cream(!), had slipped below the table and was resting so her fingertips were on Rio’s thigh.</p><p>The pull of Agatha was too much to resist and Rio wondered if this was going where she hoped it might be.</p><p>But the presence of Nicky, the reminder that this was a family unit she were intruding on, made her hesitate with every return of Agatha’s touches.</p><p>Soon enough dinner was over and Agatha told Nicky he could put the dishes away tomorrow because his performance earlier had been so excellent and Rio was hovering by the island again, cradling her wine as Agatha wrapped up the leftovers when Nicky asked:</p><p>“Mom can we watch a movie?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow and smiled a little at Agatha who for a second looked disappointed and Rio wondered if she’d had other ideas in mind for what to do with their evening together but the question was soon thrown her way and Rio had no choice but to answer in the affirmative.</p><p>“I think you should ask our guest, don’t you?”</p><p>“Rio? I’ll let you pick.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and turning her attention to Nicky again, she didn’t refuse.</p><p>So the little trio went to a room Agatha referred to as “the den” and Rio rolled her eyes at what was basically a library-cum-cinema room. Then again, twenty million a picture she supposed could buy whatever Agatha wanted.</p><p>Agatha came good on her promise of ice cream for Nicky and even brought a bowl for Rio, much to Rio’s secret delight.</p><p>And the three of them piled onto the huge, soft couch, with Agatha in the middle.</p><p>“Okay,” she said with a smirk, wriggling the control in Rio’s face, “What would Her Majesty like?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, leaning across to place her wine down so she could tuck her legs back up and focus on her ice cream.</p><p>“Have you ever seen <em>E.T.</em>, Nicky?”</p><p>“Of course he has,” Agatha said, her tone full of so much offence that Rio grinned at her.</p><p>“I love it,” Nicky piped up helpfully and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Then <em>E.T. it is.</em>”</p><p>Agatha grumbled something about being called an “unfit mother” and Rio only laughed as she watched the large screen bring the movie up and the lights begin to dim.</p><p>“This place is ridiculous,” she whispered softly, shooting Agatha a look of immense amusement as she slipped down and slapped at Rio’s arm.</p><p>By the time the titles were done, Rio had finished her ice cream and placed the bowl quietly on the side, turning to see Nicky had finished his and was tucked under his mother’s arm.</p><p>The sight made her grin so much that Agatha caught her eye and raised a brow in question at Rio’s grin.</p><p>“Cute,” Rio breathed, motioning to Nicky before settling back down on the couch.</p><p>Ten minutes later and Rio’s attention on the movie waned somewhat as Agatha’s hand had moved on top of her own thigh.</p><p>Rio glanced down at it, seeing her fingers twitch towards her slightly and she felt a jolt in her stomach at the silent request.</p><p>Was it a request?</p><p>She couldn’t take her hand. Nicky would see. But Agatha wanted something and Rio thought about it for a second (actually a few minutes) before she casually placed her hand down on the couch between them, waiting patiently for Agatha to make her move.</p><p>She did, not two minutes later, placing her hand carefully beside Rio’s and turning it so just their knuckles could brush.</p><p>And Rio realised again then that all the months of second-guessing her own feelings, of being so sure about Agatha’s lack of, they’d all be wrong.</p><p>Agatha wanted this, wanted her.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t believe that she’d missed it, that she’d convinced herself of the old lie: “happily married”.</p><p>Because Agatha may have said it, but she’d been telling her all along that she wanted her.</p><p>Agatha’s forefinger moved to stretch and brush backwards over the side of Rio’s and Rio felt her mind go blank with her desire to simply take Agatha’s hand and hold it firmly in her own.</p><p>She wanted, needed, Agatha to send Nicky to bed, so she would be able to turn to her and tell her she wanted her, that this was it.</p><p>But as the movie went on and their fingers continued to brush occasionally but never moved beyond it.</p><p>Rio knew that Agatha would have to be the one to make the move.</p><p>She couldn’t force it. Couldn’t make Agatha do something that she clearly wasn’t ready to commit to, maybe even to face about herself.</p><p>But it was okay, Rio thought with as much conviction as she had in her, because she could wait for her to be ready, and if it took longer, if it took forever, then so be it.</p><p>In years to come people could make a tragic movie about their lives and how their first kiss was their last kiss.</p><p>God, Rio thought suddenly, she <em>was</em> pathetic.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha’s voice broke her from her spiralling thoughts of deathbed confessions and weeping at funerals and Rio turned sharply to look at Agatha, frowning a little in the darkness.</p><p>“Honey. There’s a pile of blankets below the table. Will you grab a couple?”</p><p>Rio nodded and reached down carefully to find what Agatha was talking about and pulled two blankets out. She held one in her lap as she leant across, blocking Agatha’s view briefly as she draped one over Nicky where he half lay against Agatha still.</p><p>He smiled at her and she smiled back, shooting Agatha a quick look before she settled back down and draped the other blanket over their laps.</p><p>Nothing happened for a while, Rio having already made the choice that death bed was the way to go. But then, she felt it, a gentle tug against the side of her thigh, a soft request for Rio’s hand below the blanket again.</p><p>Rio ignored it for a while because she had to temper the aching in her chest.</p><p>Agatha was right beside her, their shoulders almost touching, and now she was asking for her hand.</p><p>After a few seconds of not moving she felt Agatha’s touch relax against the fabric of her pants and then her hand moved away and Rio closed her eyes as she took a deep breath in, steadying herself before she did the inevitable.</p><p>She reached slowly beneath the blanket and found Agatha’s hand now back in her own lap and brushed her fingers subtly along the back of it.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she caught Agatha turn slightly to look at her but Rio was distracted by her hand moving back down with Rio’s silent request and as Rio cleared her throat - and old childhood belief that noise would distract from something only visual - she slipped her arm beneath Agatha’s and entwined their fingers.</p><p>Her chest flared with want but she fought it down and focused instead on what she did have, which was Agatha willingly holding her hand.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her in response and Rio shuffled until she was pressing as much of herself to Agatha as she dared with an awake Nicky so close.</p><p>If she could extract herself from her own body, walk in here and see the sight before her, she might think it were a little family, just having a casual movie night. She might think one of the woman looked so delighted to be there and the other looked calm.</p><p>Her gaze might fall to Nicky and she would consider him to be warm and comfortable and loved.</p><p>And she might even pine for what she was seeing, might even consider it to be out of her reach, might not even be able to recognise that whilst it may be something she couldn’t truly have, she could have it for tonight, and maybe that would be enough.</p><p>Rio held Agatha’s hand for the rest of the movie, and every so often Agatha squeezed her or brushed her thumb over the back of Rio’s hand, until the credits rolled and Agatha made a move to nudge a sleepy Nicky from where he’d tucked himself in.</p><p>“Bed time, I think.”</p><p>Nicky didn’t protest but Rio almost did because Agatha moving meant that she had to release her hold on her hand.</p><p>But she did and Agatha turned her hand over to squeeze her thigh before she pulled away entirely, whispering to Nicky as they both stood, “Say goodnight to Rio.”</p><p>Nicky smiled and leant in to hug Rio, and Rio readily returned it, giving him a gentle squeeze before releasing him back to Agatha.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p><em>”I’ll be right back.”</em></p><p>Something in Agatha’s gaze made Rio suddenly feel nervous, as if she were suddenly expected to know what to do next, as if this whole thing hadn’t been confusing and painful but energising and exciting.</p><p>So Rio sat on the couch, toying with the blanket across her lap. She finished the now-warm wine that was in her glass and spent the rest of the time wondering what would happen when Agatha arrived back.</p><p>But she didn’t have to wait too long. Agatha was back within twenty minutes.</p><p>She paused in the door and asked: “Would you like more wine?”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>So two more minutes later and Agatha was back beside her, pouring them both more wine before she turned to Rio properly, offering her glass back to her so they could cheers.</p><p>Their eyes met over the rim of the glasses and Rio felt her stomach flip because how had she missed it before? Agatha wasn’t looking at her any differently than she usually would. Only now, she knew what that look meant.</p><p>“Nicky’s keen for dinner dancing to be a thing now, I hope you know.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, relaxing at the memory as she watched Agatha shift her weight, wrestle with the blankets below her until she could slip under them and Rio felt a rush of warmth as Agatha’s knees knocked hers lightly and she tried to play it cool by placing her elbow up on the back of the couch pretending none of this was affecting her.</p><p>But she wasn’t that good an actress.</p><p>Or maybe it was just affecting her that much.</p><p>“You’re welcome for that,” Rio managed to get out, choosing a good way through this was to drink more wine, so she did.</p><p>“Are you offering to come over every night for pre-dinner entertainment?”</p><p>Rio swallowed down the mouthful of wine thickly and watched Agatha’s gaze drop to where her throat bobbed.</p><p>“For you or Nicky?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze snapped back up suddenly and Rio felt dizzy all of a sudden, because Agatha’s pupils were blown and her lips were parted and she’d moved a fraction of an inch closer, her knees now either side of Rio’s right knee on the couch.</p><p>“Both?” Agatha tried and Rio wondered if she were trying to rein it in again, trying to calm the rising tide of tension between them.</p><p>“I would if I could,” Rio said truthfully, trying to calm her heart from racing away with itself.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze had dropped again and she turned away slightly from Rio, and Rio knew her decision earlier had been right.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t ready.</p><p>She reached for her hand and tugged it until Agatha turned back to face her, a slight furrow in her brow as she did.</p><p>“I’m going to get an uber home. I don’t think I should stay tonight.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, giving herself away in her urgency, “I’d like you to stay. Please?”</p><p>And Rio knew Agatha wouldn’t ask if she didn’t mean it so she nodded and squeezed Agatha’s hand gently, dropping her gaze to it.</p><p>“I was thinking about Friday dinner during the movie,” Agatha said slowly, clearly thinking her next words over cautiously, “Ralph will be at work until just before everyone arrives and Nicky will be away at a friend’s after school so maybe you could come over earlier?”</p><p>Rio raised her gaze slowly to Agatha’s, seeing the way her eyes darted about her face, the way her cheeks were suddenly a little flushed, the way her eyes dropped to her lips when Rio parted them and Rio wanted to scream at Agatha to kiss her.</p><p>She wanted to tell her how badly she wanted her, to make her see sense, to make her understand how desperate Rio felt whenever she was near her.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>She nodded and squeezed Agatha’s hand, “I’d like that.”</p><p>“See?” Agatha asked with a small smile, “Pre-dinner entertainment.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled widely and it was then that it happened.</p><p>Rio’s mouth was open with a retort on the tip of her tongue when Agatha had pressed her lips to her own.</p><p>Rio’s lips responded immediately, closing around Agatha’s soft top lip where Agatha’s enveloped her lower own. She applied just enough pressure to let Agatha know she wanted it.</p><p>Agatha gasped softly as she pulled away, her forehead pressing against Rio’s and her fingers untangling from where Rio still held them so she could lift her hand and hold Rio’s cheek in place, her thumb moving to brush reverently over the corner of Rio’s upper lip.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispered gently, “I… maybe I’ve had too much wine.”</p><p>Rio felt dizzy, felt unsure if this were real or not or if she’d fallen asleep during the movie and were now imagining the soft breath of Agatha Harkness against her parted lips. But Agatha had already ducked her head again and was kissing her once more, and Rio responded.</p><p>This kiss was longer, and Rio’s lips moved against Agatha’s as if they’d been doing this for years.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her cheek changed as she pushed her hand around to grasp the back of Rio’s head, pressing her desperately closer as she moved her tongue to brush her lower lip for the permission that Rio so easily granted.</p><p>She’d imagined this a million times over. She’d envisioned Agatha kissing her and yet none of it could compare. Agatha tasted like the Italian wine she’d been drinking all evening, only more delicious, but the tang of the grape was softened by the warmth of her, tender and unexpected on a night where Rio had thought the best she could get was the hold of her hand.</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s tongue with her own and a moan that other women would have had to work for, that she gave to Agatha without thinking. And Agatha responded in kind, sending shockwaves of want through Rio’s body that made her pull away suddenly.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped open and she looked panicked as Rio pulled away, her breathing uneven and heavy and her eyes wide as she stared across at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said quickly, turning and wrestling with the blanket until she was out from under it.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop her as she moved a foot or so away on the couch. She just watched. Unable to calm her racing heart as she stared at the woman now placing her wine glass down, now raising her hand to her lips, now running her other hand through her hair, now scrunching it with her fingers, now swallowing and saying: “I shouldn’t have done that.”</p><p>And Rio felt insane with it because all she wanted to do was to pull Agatha back and tell her she <em>should</em> have done it and they <em>should</em> keep doing it but her mind couldn’t pass the message to her petrified body.</p><p>In another world, Rio would be strong with it.</p><p>She’d take charge and win the war with her own feelings and tell Agatha that it was okay and that they were both a little drunk and that maybe playing happy families together for an evening was confusing for them both. And then she’d go home and they’d see each other at the next industry event.</p><p>But Rio already felt herself losing the war of rational thinking. She was placing her wine down, throwing the blanket from her lap, moving closer to Agatha again.</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha snapped quickly, her words laced with a panic that Rio recognised as fear.</p><p>She reached for her slowly, just tentatively holding her arm.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move away.</p><p>“Agatha. Tell me how you’re feeling.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s arm shift slightly as if she were to pull it away but a second later she was turning around and Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest at the sight of her soft expression, her gentle gaze.</p><p>“I don’t really want to talk.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only watch Agatha with an equally gentle gaze though her fingers flexed on her arm and her body shifted a little closer.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was already heavy, and her body felt like it was on fire, but she moved slowly, forcing herself to be mindful of the delicate situation they were in, of the gentle understanding that they were doing something that could result in a lot of people getting very hurt.</p><p>So she moved cautiously, applying pressure to Agatha’s arm until she sat back properly aware of what she might be asking.</p><p>She shifted closer. She moved to push Agatha back against the couch, and then swung around to sit above her, straddling her and raising her hands to hold her face up to her, threading her fingers into her hair as she did.</p><p>It was a bad decision. She already knew that.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands settle on her hips and she shifted just an inch or two closer, but no more.</p><p>She had to take control. Had to force herself to go slow for fear they’d burn too bright and too hot and their fire would spark out before it had even begun.</p><p>“I don’t,” she started quietly, unable to help it as her fingers threaded through dark hair. “I don’t sleep with married women.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, I know. Okay,” Agatha breathed quietly, and Rio dropped her gaze to her lips, watching them part, watching her tongue slip out and wet her lower one.</p><p>And Agatha’s gentle reassurance was all she needed to know that her rule would be broken.</p><p>That she’d break it for Agatha. If Agatha wanted her to.</p><p>“Are you sure?” She asked nervously, her hands moving back and her thumbs brushing softly over Agatha’s cheekbones as she stared down into eyes that were so dark, she could barely see any blue left.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighed softly, her hands slipping beneath her borrowed sweater to hold her sides. “I want this. I want you.”</p><p>That was all Rio needed to hear.</p><p>She closed the distance without a second’s thought, and soon Rio was moaning again, the months of buildup making her more desperate than she’d ever been for anyone.</p><p>And Agatha was bold, bolder than Rio thought she’d be. She was forceful in her touches, in her tongue as it pressed against Rio’s and caused her to rock her hips against nothing.</p><p>But Agatha felt the movement and the hands that had been just a breath away from her breasts were suddenly back at her hips, suddenly Agatha was leaning upwards, suddenly Rio was pulled and pressed and held and when she rocked again, she rocked against Agatha’s abs, and she saw stars as Agatha moaned into her mouth and gripped her so tightly she thought she’d collapse into her from the sheer magnitude of her desire.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t breathe anymore, and she had to pull away to catch her breath, even as she did, Agatha, panting just as much, chased her lips and kissed them again and again, only leaving breaths between so they could both breathe properly.</p><p>And Rio grinned into it, her eyes fluttering open to see the mess she’d made of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“I’ve been going crazy with it,” she admitted softly, even as Agatha continued to try to kiss her, reluctant to be parted as her hands squeezed and stroked and scratched all over her abdomen.</p><p>“I thought… I thought I was…” but she could barely get her words out because Agatha was so insistent, “going crazy… that I was… imagining things because… because I wanted you… so badly…”</p><p>Agatha groaned a little, and Rio rewarded her patience in allowing her to speak by capturing her lips again properly, and biting down gently on her lower one, allowing her hips to rock slowly.</p><p>“Rio, don’t,” Agatha suddenly breathed out, her voice deeper than Rio had ever heard it, breathier than should be allowed as she’d pulled away.</p><p>“I can’t,” she began to explain softly, and Rio had to fight her own groan, her own desire to seduce Agatha into changing her mind as she felt her hand move slowly up her sternum, resting between her breasts and splaying her fingers out.</p><p>It was too close, too tantalising, but she couldn’t make Agatha take her hand away.</p><p>She’d waited so long, and if this was all Agatha could give her, then that’s what she’d take.</p><p>“Nicky’s only upstairs I-…”</p><p>But Rio understood that. And so she forced herself to calm down, to take deep breaths and to rest her forehead against Agatha’s, closing her eyes as she focused on her breathing.</p><p>Agatha’s hands slowly moved back down and she held her at her hips gently, tracing slow circles there with her thumbs.</p><p>“You don’t know how badly I want you. I haven’t been able to think about anything else.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, and when she thought she could handle it, she made to move off of Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said suddenly, her gentle hold going back to firm again as she held onto her, “No, just… stay. Just for a little while longer.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispered softly, taking the opportunity to duck down and kiss Agatha again, hoping although they couldn’t go any further, at least kissing might be okay.</p><p>And Agatha kissed her back, so Rio leant into it once more, breaking the kiss only when she felt like she might lose control and try to push again.</p><p>Agatha was firm and urgent but she was also inexperienced and had a sleeping child upstairs so Rio had to be cautious. She had to be considerate.</p><p>Though her body was screaming at her to do more, to make Agatha touch her more.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said quietly, after five more minutes of allowing her to hold her, of soft kissed exchanged, “I’m going to get off now, okay? I can’t… I need to move away a little.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened briefly but then she released her and slipped her hands from beneath her shirt so Rio could slip from her and slide down onto the couch beside her.</p><p>She tucked her legs beneath her and bit down on her lip as Agatha adjusted her position to look at Rio, her lips as swollen as Rio’s must be, and her cheeks just as flushed.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Rio asked cautiously, unsure whether it was a good idea to even ask.</p><p>But she reached out to take Agatha’s hand and Agatha allowed it, watching as Rio kissed each finger in turn and then slowly turned her hand to kiss her palm and Rio held her hand there when she saw tears forming in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Rio pressed back in slowly, moving to manoeuvre them so Agatha would wrap her arms around her and she could do the same.</p><p>“Hey,” she dropped her voice to barely a whisper as she saw the first tear drop and she kissed it away gently against Agatha’s cheek, “it’s okay. I’m sorry, it’s okay.”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t say anything else and simply turned her head to kiss Rio again, and Rio knew she wasn’t ready. And that she’d wait a lifetime for her to be so.</p><p>A slight nausea rose in Rio’s stomach then. A gentle wave of horror that seemingly came from nowhere but that promise more; a tidal wave of guilt. But she sucked it up because Agatha was hurting and needed her in that moment.</p><p>She dropped her hold of Agatha’s cheek and moved her hand instead to wrestle with the collar of her sweater, twisting it slowly in her hand before she leant in and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>It was meant to be gentle. To be reassuring.</p><p>Rio wanted Agatha to know that she had her, that she would have her, that she’d go to her grave with the secret of Agatha Harkness wanting to kiss her.</p><p>But just like that, the dam burst and Agatha was kissing her properly again, pushing up and over Rio to get her onto her back.</p><p>They broke apart when Rio’s back hit the seat cushions and Agatha was left gasping above her, looking wilder than Rio had ever seen her.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and shifted a little to get more comfortable, watching the way Agatha reacted when she pushed her hands just beneath her sweater to caress the warm skin there.</p><p>It didn’t make sense. That Agatha could be so vulnerable and then so adamant within minutes. But she couldn’t think straight. Not with Agatha now leaning above her. Not with her looking at her like that.</p><p>“You look so beautiful,” Rio murmured, unable to help herself when she had a goddess leaning over her.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched a little and she pulled slowly back, shifting from her position on all fours to rest back on her ankles over Rio’s thighs. Rio’s hold dropped from her and she raised herself up on her elbows to watch Agatha, seeing her wrestle with her self.</p><p>“Tell me what you need.”</p><p>And she watched as Agatha reached to grab Rio’s collar, tugging for only a second before Rio raised herself up and wrapped her arms snuggly around Agatha’s hips. Agatha’s hands cupped Rio’s face and she frowned as she stared down at her lips, clearly considering what it was she needed, or would allow herself to have.</p><p>“I need you inside of me.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened and she felt Agatha’s words travel directly to between her thighs as she shifted slightly beneath her, watching cautiously for any signs that Agatha might change her mind.</p><p>But she didn’t. She hadn’t.</p><p>Agatha only leant in and kissed her again, tilting her head up so she could curl her tongue inside Rio’s mouth once more and make her moan the way she had before.</p><p>She felt fragile below Agatha, terrified she’d do something wrong, that Agatha would pull away, and she’d shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>But Agatha was apparently unaware of Rio’s fragility because she had taken her lower lip and sucked on it, making Rio groan quietly as she moved her hands to Agatha’s hips and pressed them down and into her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha husked as she released her lip and traced along it with her tongue, “touch me.”</p><p>Mute and needy, Rio reached between them, keeping her eyes up on Agatha as she turned her hand over and slipped her hand beneath her sweater, sliding past the waistband of her pants until she was cupping Agatha through her underwear.</p><p>Rio swallowed.</p><p>She was soaked.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise and rocked her hips down against Rio’s hand and Rio marvelled at the sight of it, at Agatha above her, her face twisted in desperate concentration as she rocked again and again.</p><p>“Rio, please.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need told a third time.</p><p>Because Agatha was as desperate as she felt.</p><p>She bit down on her lip to prevent herself from moaning as she slid her hand up again, pressing her fingers below the soft fabric of Agatha’s underwear, until she brushed over a patch of damp hair and down further.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t shy about moving against her, about rocking her hips, and Rio could barely keep it together as she scissored two fingers either side of Agatha’s swollen clit and began to move back and forth, applying just the slightest pressure.</p><p>“F-fuck, fuck.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed as Rio continued to tease her, her hand already slippery wet as she pressed deeper to tease around Agatha’s entrance.</p><p>She was needy, that much she could tell. Her hips still rolled with every stroke and touch of Rio’s fingers and Rio grunted quietly as she felt the small entrance flutter as she pressed the tips of her two fingers into Agatha.</p><p>The reaction was immediate, where Agatha had been sitting tall above her, her back arched and her eyes still closed, she now bent inwards, clutching at Rio’s shirt and hair, her face pressing into her neck as she murmured her name over and over.</p><p>And Rio rewarded her by pressing her fingers fully inside, feeling the blessed tightness around them, the squeeze of Agatha as she adjusted and rocked into her once more.</p><p>And then Agatha’s lips were pressing against her pulse point and Rio moaned quietly as she twisted her hand a little, wincing at the angle with Agatha now pressed impossibly against her but how could she stop when fucking Agatha like this was all she’d been able to think about.</p><p>Agatha was pressing sloppy, desperate kisses to Rio’s neck, her jaw, her lips.</p><p>And it was as Rio tasted Agatha’s tongue again that the woman above her released a heavy moan into her mouth and Rio felt her clench around her as her orgasm crashed over her.</p><p>It had taken less than two minutes, and Rio didn’t know whether Agatha was just sensitive or if she could feel smug that she’d been so responsive to her.</p><p>The idea that it was the latter made Rio feel insane with desire.</p><p>Rio curled her fingers inwards, pressing her palm still firmly over Agatha’s clit and allowed her to rock her hips slowly still, riding the orgasm out.</p><p>Agatha pulled away from Rio’s lips only for a second before she began to kiss them again, one kiss for every rock of her hips.</p><p>“Was that,” Rio asked cautiously, nervous now even as Agatha continued to press soft kisses to her, “okay?”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered as she brushed their lips together again, her hips stuttering, “baby.”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly and Agatha smiled a little, catching the noise against her lips as she reached down between them to hold Rio’s wrist and Rio knew what it meant, so she pulled out slowly, watching as Agatha whined a little and moved her hand to rest delicately on her clothed hip.</p><p>“I’d keep your fingers there all night if I could,” Agatha said softly, brushing their noses together.</p><p>“I wouldn’t object,” Rio murmured, knowing already that she’d live inside of Agatha if she could.</p><p>Agatha smiled against her lips and Rio smiled right back, feeling the glow of Agatha’s attention warming her from inside out.</p><p>“I want to touch you first, okay?”</p><p>“You don’t have to.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, a little firmer than before as she pulled back a little and moved her hand to Rio’s jaw, holding it firmly between her fingers and thumb, “second only to you being inside me, I want nothing more than to fuck you, okay?”</p><p>Rio could only nod, so harsh was the hold Agatha had on her that she couldn’t speak.</p><p>She let Agatha guide her onto her back and whimpered a little when she brushed her lips over her throat, her tongue flicking out as she shifted and Rio felt the telltale movements of a hand slipping below her underwear.</p><p>“It’s… it’s different than being with a man,” she said quietly, her mind a blissful blank even as she tried to give some reassurance, knowing Agatha hadn’t done this before.</p><p>Agatha just hummed, “no shit.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little when she felt Agatha’s fingers toy with the little hairs at the apex of her pussy, managing only just to keep her hips still.</p><p>“It’s more delicate… more-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned quietly as she lifted her head up to gaze down at her, at the same time sliding her fingers down to press where Rio so desperately wanted her.</p><p>“If you keep trying to talk me through it I will stop. Do you want me to stop?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows as she pressed her middle finger against her, brushing length ways through her soaked centre, just grazing her clit with every pull upwards.</p><p>“N-no. Don’t stop.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said with a dark glint in her eyes, her pupils making her usually bright blue eyes look practically black.</p><p>“Are you usually this wet?”</p><p>Agatha asked curiously and Rio blushed as she felt Agatha dip lower in her explorations of her, “No,” she managed to croak, “all for you.”</p><p>Rio felt herself slip further and further from her rational mind as Agatha smirked down at her and she lost herself completely when Agatha thrust into her with a suddenness that made Rio shout out a moan.</p><p>Above her, Agatha adjusted herself, leaning up on her knees slightly so she could place a hand over Rio’s mouth. Agatha was firm against her, and the movements of her left hand were harsher than Rio had been with her but the addition of her palm covering her mouth made Rio clutch at Agatha’s sweater, clawing at her as Agatha fucked her, maintaining eye contact the whole time.</p><p>Rio grunted and groaned beneath Agatha, and her eyes almost rolled into the back of her head when Agatha managed to twist her hand, fumbling for only a few seconds before she found Rio’s clit.</p><p>The woman was a virtuoso.</p><p>Rio’s whole body was attuned to everything that Agatha was giving her and Rio didn’t have the capacity of mind to try to understand whether it was because it was Agatha touching her or whether Agatha was already just that good.</p><p>But she came with a muffled cry, her whole body arching off the couch and causing Agatha to gape at her, her eyes wide at the state she’d made of Rio Vidal.</p><p>She didn’t stop the movements of her hand even when Rio began to whine softly, her hand moving up to take Agatha’s away from her hot, wet mouth.</p><p>“You… stop, Agatha. It’s too much.”</p><p>Agatha nodded a little, reducing her movements to a standstill but not moving her hand away.</p><p>She stared at Rio in amazement for a little while before she leant down and kissed her slowly, her fingers twitching inside of her when Rio met her tongue with her own.</p><p>It was a lazy kiss, a kiss between two people who had all the time in the world, and Rio only huffed when Agatha pulled back, and her hand slowly pulled away from her, brushing soft strokes through her soaked folds before she slipped it back out and rested it around her hip.</p><p>“For a first time that was…”</p><p>But Agatha was smiling and Rio lost her train of thought as she grinned up at her, “you’re incredible.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a soft laugh and kissed Rio sweetly on the nose, lowering her body cautiously so she could lie on top of her.</p><p>“I want a whole day with you. Twenty four hours of…” Agatha bit her lip as she shifted to rest herself down properly, pressing her face in against Rio’s neck and sliding her damp hand below her shirt to sit at her hip.</p><p>“Just this. Just you. Naked.”</p><p>She kissed Rio’s neck and Rio hummed from deep within her throat, before she released a gentle laugh at the absurdity of it all.</p><p>“You mean instead of a quick fuck on the couch of your cinema room?”</p><p>Agatha pressed her face closer then, and Rio gasped quietly as she nipped lightly at her skin, “More than twenty four hours. A week.”</p><p>“A week of just this?”</p><p>“Just us.”</p><p>The promise settled in a part of Rio’s brain that made her shiver slightly, and Agatha felt it against her, and moved her hand up her side until it could curl around her ribs just below her breast.</p><p>They were silent for a while and Rio felt the soft comfort of just having someone close for a while, of having Agatha close, a woman she’d craved and yearned for for weeks.</p><p>A woman who, was now pressed as close as she could be and was pressing soft kisses to Rio’s throat every so often, allowing her lips to graze there and her nose to brush along it as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Rio’s hold around Agatha tightened slightly every time she did this and she relaxed so much that she began to drift away, feeling safe and more content than she had in weeks.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Her whispered name jolted her back awake and Rio blinked into the dim light to see Agatha hovering above her, a slightly amused smile on her face.</p><p>“You were snoring, honey.”</p><p>“I… I wasn’t.”</p><p>“Yes you were,” Agatha grinned, pressing a kiss to Rio’s pouting lips.</p><p>“It’s okay. It was soft. It was sweet.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed as Agatha squeezed her waist and continued to grin at her, “Did I tire you out?”</p><p>“Oh shut up,” Rio said with an exaggerated scowl as Agatha laughed and stole a quick kiss, “one orgasm is not enough to tire me out.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes as Agatha beamed at her, and Rio briefly forgot what she was arguing about as she did.</p><p>“Would two orgasms tire you out?” Agatha asked innocently, her brows raising as if she’d asked nothing more innocent than ‘how are you feeling today?’.</p><p>But Rio could feel the want in Agatha voice and body.</p><p>Her eyes were darker again, her fingers curled tightly across her rib cage and her thumb making small moves towards the underside of her breast.</p><p>“I’m sure I could handle it.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and began to move her hand back down but Rio caught it just as it moved to her lower abdomen and Agatha raised her brows in question.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re a quick study.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows raised further and she wriggled her fingers in Rio’s hold, “Then let go and let me study some more.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t let up and she watched Agatha with a growing smirk, beginning to see the impatience slip in, “I’m the first woman you’ve been with?”</p><p>“You know that.”</p><p>“How did it feel?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched again and Rio’s smirk only grew some more as Agatha remained silent above her, “Didn’t the fact that I came so quickly tell you all you needed to know?”</p><p>“You liked it,” Rio concluded with a raised brow but Agatha had clearly had enough teasing and forcibly pulled her hand away from Rio’s clutches.</p><p>“You,” she said with a sneer as Rio grinned.</p><p>“Are,” she emphasised as she leant up on her knees and took hold of Rio’s wrists.</p><p>“Incredibly,” she pinned them above her head.</p><p>“Annoying.”</p><p>Rio only beamed up at Agatha, her cheeks giving away her reaction to this sudden show of dominance.</p><p>She let them sit in it for a second, watching as Agatha’s lips parted and she shifted above her, straddling her hips but not close enough that even as Rio arched her back she could reach her.</p><p>“Holding me like this won’t get you anywhere,” she warned with a lick of her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched a little and she seemed to be weighing her options as she stared down between them.</p><p>“A week wouldn’t be enough,” she concluded, making Rio’s brows shoot up and her grin to return.</p><p>“No? How long, Agatha? How long would you need to have me all to yourself before you were satisfied?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond with her words.</p><p>She moved her right hand down to Rio’s throat, brushing the sides with her fingers gently before she trailed further down, her fingers brushing across her left breast over her sweater.</p><p>Rio moaned quietly, arching her chest up for more.</p><p>Blue eyes flashed to large brown ones and Agatha moved her hand down further until she could slide it beneath her borrowed sweater, returning her hand to her breast properly, and gasping as she finally made contact and groped at it with a firm and desperate touch.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned quietly, rocking her hips after a particularly harsh squeeze, “stop teasing.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and raised her brows as she pinched Rio’s nipple to elicit a soft moan from the woman beneath her.</p><p>“You’re so responsive.”</p><p>Rio just groaned, knowing that meant Agatha wouldn’t be giving in any time soon.</p><p>And sure enough, Agatha shifted down, releasing her hold on her wrists to press her face back in against Rio’s neck, her soft kisses now becoming firm and hungry and Rio tried to rock into her again, regretting bitterly that she’d stopped Agatha’s hand earlier.</p><p>“Agatha,” she tried to plead as the older woman above her pulled her hand away from her breast and moved it to push her sweater up, moving down enough that as she gathered it at Rio’s throat she could hover just a few inches above her breasts.</p><p>Rio had never done nudity in her films. So she knew this was the first time Agatha was seeing her naked breasts and she flushed a deep crimson at the sight of Agatha’s gaze on her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio pleaded again, her voice now a barely contained moan with every second she had to wait with Agatha just above her, staring down at her breasts.</p><p>But midnight blue eyes flickered up to meet Rio’s gaze and Agatha hesitated before she spoke again, her voice a breathy husk, “How are you real?”</p><p>The question took Rio by surprise and she raised her brows a little, watching as Agatha stared openly at her, unembarrassed and unashamed at her marvelling.</p><p>Rio couldn’t imagine a situation whether this were happening to her in real life, where Agatha Harkness was staring down at her with open, unrelenting, want.</p><p>But it was happening.</p><p>And soon she felt her lips enclose around her pert nipple, her hand slide back down between her legs.</p><p>Agatha was inside her again, her breast was in her mouth, and her moans were filling the room even as she clamped her own hand down against her mouth.</p><p>This time Agatha didn’t fumble at all where she touched her.</p><p>She didn’t hesitate to twist her hand.</p><p>She found her clit with ease.</p><p>Pressed into her without pause.</p><p>And nipped and sucked and teased her breast as she did so.</p><p>Rio came with a muffled cry of Agatha’s name, her hips bucking erratically as Agatha kept her filled with three fingers, testing Rio’s reactions as she tried to stretch her as much as she could.</p><p>When Agatha came up for breath she rested her cheek between Rio’s breasts but remained buried inside of her, her fingers curling and uncurling experimentally, as if trying to scope the very limits of what she could do to her.</p><p>“Stop, stop,” Rio groaned eventually, one hand reaching for Agatha’s taught bicep and the other moving to scratch at her scalp.</p><p>Agatha released a soft laugh that Rio felt against her chest and she huffed when Agatha didn’t pull out of her, squeezing her arm softly, “You can’t just leave them in. That’s so-…”</p><p>“What?” Agatha accused with a smirk against Rio’s skin, “Making up for lost time.”</p><p>“That isn’t how it works,” Rio said as she shifted her hips a little, squeezing her arm again as Agatha’s fingers twitched.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>And she pulled out slowly, making Rio groan a little at the slowness of it, chasing the feeling of her fingers inside her until they finally pulled away properly and Agatha moved her hand to rest across her stomach, the damp feel of it making Rio squirm for different reasons.</p><p>“This isn’t enough,” Agatha said softly, her fingers curling where they lay.</p><p>“I need more.”</p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha’s arm gently, “Let’s go upstairs. We can-…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back and shook her head as she gazed down at Rio, “No. Not while Nicky’s home. We shouldn’t even…”</p><p>She glanced down and made light work of tugging Rio’s sweater down properly as she sat up again, straddling her hips and sighing.</p><p>She suddenly looked fraught.</p><p>“We shouldn’t have done this. Not here. Not like this.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lower lip as she watched the frustration slip back into Agatha’s face, watched her close her eyes and run her clean hand through her hair.</p><p>“I’ve done this all wrong.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said quickly as she sat up and wrapped her arms tightly around Agatha’s hips. “There’s no right way to do this.”</p><p>“But there’s a wrong way. And that’s on a couch with your son asleep upstairs.”</p><p>Rio shook her head but realised she couldn’t reassure Agatha because it wasn’t her son upstairs.</p><p>It wasn’t her family home.</p><p>And she felt sick with it too.</p><p>“Next time, we can do it right. However you want. Wherever you want. Okay?”</p><p><em>Please let there be a next time,</em> Rio pleaded silently as she rubbed along Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>Agatha only sighed and Rio worried she’d lost her until she leant in and kissed her softly, lingering for a while until she pulled back.</p><p>“Stop being understanding.”</p><p>“You want me to pick a fight?”</p><p>“I want you. Period.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this, feeling that same warmth from before settle in her chest and she tugged Agatha closer to her, wanting to feel all of her, all at once.</p><p>“You have me.”</p><p>“I want more of you,” Agatha said quietly, an unusual shyness appearing across her features.</p><p>“I want all of you,” Rio whispered just as softly, leaning up to brush their lips together.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but returned her hands to Rio’s hair, her thumbs brushing along the corners of her jaw.</p><p>And then Rio found that she was pressed onto her back again, Agatha expertly now adjusting her weight to lie over her properly, not protesting when Rio slipped her hand between them and slid into her pants once more.</p><p>Agatha came just as quickly as she had before and Rio almost came with her as she sank her teeth into her neck when she did.</p><p>Agatha whimpered where Rio was bolder and eased her down with soft brushes of her thumb over her clit, feeling feral with the response of the woman above her, burying her face in her soft hair.</p><p>“So quick,” Rio teased gently when she’d pulled her hand fully away, subtly wiping it on the side of her own pants.</p><p>Agatha just hummed, apparently too spaced to respond properly as Rio turned her head slightly into her, trying to nuzzle closer.</p><p>Agatha shifted a little and eventually pulled back to kiss Rio, nipping playfully at her lower lip.</p><p>Rio smiled at this and raised her brows when Agatha pulled away further and looked a little sheepish for a second.</p><p>“I… think I gave you a hickey.”</p><p>Rio blinked and reached absently for her neck as if she’d be able to feel it.</p><p>“Agatha. Are you fifteen years old?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and ducked her head down to Rio’s other side, placing soft kisses to the uninjured side of her neck before she simply collapsed back down and released a heavy breath against her skin.</p><p>“Alice will kill you,” Rio said absently as she closed her eyes and wrapped her arms properly around Agatha, feeling her chest warm up again with her being this close.</p><p>“You won’t tell-…”</p><p>“No, of course not. You’re safe with me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly but Rio felt that she still appeared nervous so she leant down and kissed her cheek as best she could nuzzled into her for a second.</p><p>She felt Agatha relax in her arms.</p><p>“I’ll put one this side,” Agatha huffed, “even it out.”</p><p>“Don’t you dare.”</p><p>But Agatha had already nipped at her and Rio shifted beneath her, wrestling and rocking until she was able to turn them onto their sides and she could shuffle down to be face to face with Agatha on the couch.</p><p>Agatha looked back with a shyness that hadn’t been there all evening, and reached up to brush her fingers along Rio’s cheek, “I’m not even a little sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled but rolled her eyes, “Why am I not surprised?”</p><p>Agatha hummed and moved her fingers down to brush across Rio’s lips, watching them part for her with interest.</p><p>“With other women… do you usually… I mean… how did I…?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said with a firmness to her tone that hadn’t even been there when chastising her about the hickey, “are you asking me if you are better than the other women I’ve slept with?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“After your first time with a woman?”</p><p>“I’m taking that as a no.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and Agatha’s fingers circled back to trace the curve of Rio’s grin, “Actually, you’re the best I’ve had in a while.”</p><p>“A while?”</p><p>“Ever? Is that what you want to hear?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged slightly but Rio saw a glimmer of something in her eyes that told her it was exactly what she wanted to hear and she smiled some more even as Agatha pressed the tips of her two fingers just past her lips, “That just means we’ll need to keep doing this. Until you’re sure I’m the best you’ve ever had.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, having no problem at all with dedicating the rest of her life to proving to Agatha that she believed that with her whole heart already.</p><p>But the hum turned to a groan when Agatha pressed her fingers further into her mouth and pressed down on her tongue.</p><p>Rio raised her brows a little as she pressed her tongue up slightly, watching Agatha’s pupils dilate again as she kept her gaze down on where her fingers were now fully swallowed by Rio’s lips.</p><p>She twitched them up slightly, pressing further in until she could feel the soft wet walls of the back of Rio’s throat, making her gag around her.</p><p>She only pulled back when she looked up and saw Rio’s eyes fill with unshed tears and she pulled fully out slowly, transferring her fingers to her own mouth to clean Rio’s spit from them.</p><p>Rio panted quietly, pressing more firmly into Agatha as she watched, “it’s a sin that we haven’t been doing this since we met.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her fingers slowly from her own lips, her eyes darting quickly across Rio’s face and Rio, despite what she’d just done, what Rio had allowed, and how desperate she must look for her, saw that same flicker of shyness in Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>It was like two different women.</p><p>One aware of the impact she had on Rio. The other completely oblivious or shocked by it.</p><p>But Rio had lived with a closeted and scared Alice for long enough that she knew why Agatha might be shy with her.!</p><p>And that’s why her next words took her by surprise so suddenly.</p><p>“I think you’re the reason I have Nicky.”</p><p>Rio frowned suddenly, worrying that she was so punch-drunk that she had missed what Agatha said entirely.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I think,” Agatha swallowed thickly, moving her hand down to wipe her fingers against Rio’s sweater before she settled her hand back underneath it and held Rio’s hip.</p><p>“I barely let Ralph touch me and then… after meeting you in the bar… the next time we were together I got so drunk we had sex for the first time since our wedding night and I didn’t make him wear a condom and… and the next month I was pregnant.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted in surprise, her brow furrowing more deeply at not only Agatha’s assumption but at this knew kernel of insight into Agatha’s relationship with her husband.</p><p>If twenty four year old Rio had known that Agatha Harkness had had sex with her husband because she couldn’t have sex with Rio she would have been the cockiest piece of shit in the world.</p><p>In fact, thirty two year old Rio suddenly felt like the cockiest piece of shit in the world.</p><p>“You had sex with Ralph because… you wanted me?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>“And that got you pregnant?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up totally, staring in disbelief at Agatha even as a slow smirk crept up her face, “Did you think of me when-…?”</p><p>“You’re enjoying this.”</p><p>“Who wouldn’t? You had sex with your husband, thought of me, and got pregnant with Nicky? That’s-…”</p><p>“I hate that you’re enjoying this so much.”</p><p>“Agatha, you gotta give me this one.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and huffed out a breath against Rio’s smirking lips, “You’re missing the point.”</p><p>“Is the point that I’m your baby daddy?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Mmhm?”</p><p>But Rio’s grin must have had some impact on Agatha because she began to smile ever so slightly, “Can we get back to the point.”</p><p>“What was the point?”</p><p>“The point is that I’m married.”</p><p>The air was taken a little out of the room then and Rio’s smile slowly faded down to nothing.</p><p>The desire in her belly fizzled down to nausea and she tried to fight it off, desperate to not focus on the Ralph-sized elephant in the room.</p><p>She wasn’t a person who slept with married women. Not usually.</p><p>“Right. Unhappily so.”</p><p>She had to believe it.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You… you don’t have sex with him?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head a little, leaning in to brush their noses together lightly, “no.”</p><p>“Maybe once a year. He… I let him sleep around. As long as he’s discreet.”</p><p>“And you?” Rio asked cautiously, suddenly wondering if it had all been a clever lie, and that she wasn’t the first woman Agatha had slept with.</p><p>“Not until tonight.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“My life is Nicky and work. I don’t need anything else.”</p><p>Rio swallowed this down like a dry pill, but forced herself to nod, to not look like Agatha had just stabbed her through the heart.</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat quietly, a slight frown marring her features.</p><p>“Would you ever leave him?”</p><p>“I can’t answer that.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and nodded slowly, wondering how she’d let herself fall for a married woman so easily. Wondering why she’d thought coming here tonight was a good idea, that dancing in the kitchen with Agatha and her son was smart, that fucking her on the couch would help anything.</p><p>“I meant what I said earlier. That I want more of you.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio repeated, feeling somehow dizzy with her desire for Agatha, her desire to give more, and the worry that she’d pull away entirely.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed quietly, clearly responding to the way Rio was reacting, a hint of panic in her tone, “I mean it.”</p><p>“Okay,” was all Rio could say, too busy trying to focus on easing the racing of her traitorous heart.</p><p>“Do you want me?”</p><p>The question was so simple, so plainly spoken, that Rio frowned when it was asked, her eyes flashing open again, her brain doing backflips to try to decipher the twist in it, the con that wasn’t there.</p><p>Because she thought she’d been clear this whole time.</p><p>“I want you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded only slightly, and Rio could tell she was working through the same thoughts as Rio, expecting a change of heart that never came.</p><p>And so she pressed her lips to Rio’s, and Rio poured all of her want into the kiss, trying to tell Agatha that she meant it, that she wanted her so desperately but she couldn’t fathom a world where this would work for them.</p><p>But it was working now.</p><p>And so she focused on that, and nothing else.</p><p>They pulled apart only for air and Agatha rolled them again until she was over Rio and could bury her face against the side where she’d left her mark.</p><p>“If we stay here longer,” she whispered quietly against Rio’s skin, “I won’t be able to stop.”</p><p>“Then don’t.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and pulled back, all shyness from earlier gone again as she dazzled down at Rio, “I have to get up early to take Nicky to school tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said with a dazed expression as she blinked up at Agatha. “But Friday. All day. Just us. Please? We need to talk.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slightly, her smile beginning to soften across her features.</p><p>But then she was pulling back, pulling Rio with her, kissing her again with her hands buried in her hair, pressing as close as she could to her.</p><p>“Bed,” she instructed quietly when she pulled away and left Rio aching for more.</p><p>And Rio knew that as soon as they left the relative safety of the couch that things would change.</p><p>They’d have to face the reality of it.</p><p>They’d have to acknowledged that what had happened tonight was a fluke. That they’d both just wanted each other so badly. But that want and need were different things.</p><p>Rio wanted Agatha and now she knew Agatha wanted Rio too. But that wasn’t anything when Agatha was married. With a son. And she had no plans to leave her husband.</p><p>And so they fumbled together until Agatha had Rio against the door and Rio was whining with newfound desire to get her hands back against Agatha, wanting to be inside her one last time, wanting her clothes off fully, her body flushed and sweaty and begging for more.</p><p>Rio rationalised to herself that the couch extended to the room around them. Past that, she’d be sensible. She’d relent and never again touch Agatha Harkness.</p><p>But Agatha was aggressive with her denial, holding Rio’s hands against the door and her hips pressing Rio’s down so she couldn’t rock them.</p><p>“We can’t.”</p><p>“One more. I haven’t even seen you naked.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha warned quietly, raising her brows as Rio huffed and closed her eyes as she forced her body to relax, going slack beneath Agatha’s firm hold on her.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll behave. But next time.”</p><p>She flashed her eyes open and saw that even Agatha looked reluctant now to keep her from touching her.</p><p>“Naked,” Rio said insistently. “I want you naked and I want to taste you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her wrists tightened so much that Rio hissed as her nails dug into her flesh and groaned when Agatha pressed a little firmer with her hips, “Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Friday. Just two days.”</p><p>“If you can last that long then you need to let go of me,” Rio challenged suddenly, feeling a flair of confidence that Agatha wanted it as much as she did.</p><p>But Agatha had the trump card.</p><p>She had the son.</p><p>She had ultimate reason to not give in when Rio could have forgone her principles just one more time and pushed Agatha back onto the couch.</p><p>Agatha relaxed her hold on Rio slowly, and then all at once, stepping backwards with a frown and a huff that told Rio everything she needed to know.</p><p>And Rio smiled because at least this way, she wouldn’t be the only one suffering until she could get Agatha naked and on her back.</p><p>She moved a step closer and leant in to kiss Agatha’s cheek as politely as if they’d just met for the first time at a premier.</p><p>“You’ll have to sleep in the guest room,” Agatha said softly, watching as Rio pulled away.</p><p>But Rio hadn’t expected or wanted to sleep in the bed she assumed Agatha shared with Ralph and so she only nodded, taken aback slightly when Agatha suddenly held her face in her hands and kissed her firmly, keeping their lips pressed together for a longer than Rio was expecting and not pushing for anything more than the contact of it.</p><p>But she pulled away again and Rio was left with nothing but a hand in hers and a soft promise that they could be together properly again in two days time.</p><p>They walked silently through the house and up the stairs until Agatha stopped them at the entrance to the guest room and she pressed a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“I’ll fetch you something to sleep in.”</p><p>She turned then and began to walk down the hall as Rio watched her and chewed on her lip for a second.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha turned halfway down the hallway and looked at Rio curiously.</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened briefly where she held the doorframe and she hesitated only for a second, encouraged by the soft expression on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Don’t make me sleep alone tonight.”</p>

<p><em>“Don’t make me sleep alone tonight.”</em></p><p>Agatha strode back over to her, her hands finding their home on Rio’s face.</p><p>“I can’t tonight. If Nicky…”</p><p>She trailed off as Rio looked down and began toying with the hem of Agatha’s sweater.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away then and Rio felt the loss of her in a way she never had before. Because she’d <em>had</em> Agatha. In her home. She’d felt her against her skin, pressed against her body, writhing and moaning on top of her.</p><p>And now she was being faced with the reality.</p><p>That she had had Agatha.</p><p>And maybe, if she were lucky, she could have her again.</p><p>But she’d have to sleep alone.</p><p>Because Agatha didn’t belong to her.</p><p>Just as Rio was hitting the peak of her pity spiral, Agatha arrived back.</p><p>She pressed a dark t-shirt and soft pyjama pants against Rio’s chest and Rio saw a hesitation in Agatha as they locked eyes again.</p><p>“I want to,” she said quietly, her fingers tensing in the fabric of the offered pyjamas. “I don’t want to leave you but I can’t risk it.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio uttered, because she did understand the need to protect Nicky from this. They were fully grown adults and they didn’t know what they were doing. How would they explain it to a seven year old who had only just been introduced to Rio was suddenly sleeping with his mother.</p><p>That his mother was betraying his father.</p><p>So Rio had to be an adult and endure sleeping across the hall from Agatha when she knew what she tasted like, knew how she felt against her.</p><p>“Goodnight,” she said in a whisper, barely able to form the two syllables that locked her out of the night she wanted with the woman before her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted and Rio thought, <em>hoped</em>, she might waver on her decision.</p><p>But she turned away.</p><p>She took long, confident strides back to her own room and left Rio standing in the door, staring hopelessly at the woman she’d just broken her own moral code for.</p><p>And then Rio closed the door.</p><p>And she was alone.</p><p>As the lock clicked into place Rio felt her world collapse in on itself.</p><p>She felt small, in a large room.</p><p>She moved away to strip Agatha’s clothes from her body and instead slip into the borrowed pyjamas.</p><p>They were soft against her skin and smelled of Agatha. And she hated herself for lifting the collar and breathing it in.</p><p>She’d become a monster who yearned.</p><p>The bed was a welcome embrace when she finally climbed into it after washing her face and brushing her teeth in the en suite attached.</p><p>She curled in on herself, tugging a plush pillow down to act as an inanimate, and therefore willing, receptacle of her sorrows. She wrapped around it and squeezed her eyes shut and willed sleep that wouldn’t come.</p><p>Perhaps fantasies were fantasises for a reason. Perhaps Agatha’s imagined lips and hands on her were better than the real thing.</p><p>Because the fantasy made Rio yearn.</p><p>But they didn’t make her mourn.</p><p>And now she’d had what she’d fantasied about. But she didn’t want the fantasy Agatha.</p><p>She wanted the real, warm, alive woman who could light a fire in her body and ask her to burn everything down.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and tried to think of things that weren’t Agatha.</p><p>But all she could smell was Agatha.</p><p>All she could feel on her body were the soft fabrics of Agatha’s clothes.</p><p>Sleep eluded her.</p><p>She lay awake all night, drifting for no more than twenty minutes at a time until the little alarm clock on the side told her it was 6:45 and she heard movement outside.</p><p>She peeled herself out of her Egyptian cotton prison and went quickly to brush her teeth and splash cool water on her face in an attempt to force herself to wake properly.</p><p>But there was no waking from the living nightmare that meant she had now experienced something she could probably never have again.</p><p>In the mirror she spotted the bruise on her neck and she touched it gently. It was evidence that last night had been real. That Agatha had wanted her enough to mark her as her own.</p><p>With no makeup with her and the prospect of seeing Nicky she simply swept her hair over her shoulder and hid it from view.</p><p>The hall was empty by the time Rio stepped into it and but she could hear noises not far away, the telltale signs of a coffee pot brewing, the tinny sounds of the radio, the soft giggles of a little boy who Agatha believed was hers because she’d wanted Rio so badly.</p><p>It made Rio’s heart stutter in her chest at the thought.</p><p>But her body moved where her mind remained stuck on the same topic that had kept her awake all night.</p><p>She made her way to the kitchen and found before her a sight that to anyone else would have been a simple, happy vignette but now to Rio Vidal was a reminder of what she didn’t have and was therefore barbarous to her sensitive heart.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha said softly from her place by the island.</p><p>She wore a light, flannel robe and her hands were curled around a large mug of coffee.</p><p>“Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s gaze told Rio that this wasn’t what Agatha actually wanted to know but she couldn’t say anything other than the bare-faced lie that came from her lips: “Amazingly.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched at the sides and Rio had to look away for fear she’d simply stare.</p><p>And staring over cornflakes was not a very cool thing to do.</p><p>She moved instead to sit on a stool beside Nicky, mirroring the smile he sent her over his bowl of Cheerios.</p><p>“Morning, kid. What’s on the schedule today?”</p><p>“School.”</p><p>“Just school? No championships to win?”</p><p>Nicky grinned around his spoon and Rio grinned back when he managed to dribble milk back into his bowl.</p><p>He was easy to love.</p><p>Agatha moved around with a paper towel to wipe at his mouth, kissing his cheek when she was done.</p><p>“Messy,” she said with a smile.</p><p>“Nicky’s taking his new jersey for basketball practice this afternoon.”</p><p>“Is that right?” Rio asked in amusement as Agatha moved away to fetch more coffee.</p><p>“They have a game next week.”</p><p>“I don’t think we’ll win. We never win.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Rio hummed thoughtfully, watching the little boy turn his attention back to his cereal. “Well, if you take that jersey with you I think you just might. Green is a lucky colour. Plus, with how good you were yesterday there’s <em>no way</em> you won’t win.”</p><p>Agatha placed her coffee down before her and grazed her fingers along the back of Rio’s hand as she pulled away.</p><p>“I’m not as tall as the others.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” Rio felt Agatha’s hand settle on her shoulder. She forced herself not to take it.</p><p>“I’m not that tall either and I can run rings around everyone.”</p><p>She felt Agatha squeeze her shoulder and then move away.</p><p>God, she wanted her.</p><p>“Rings?”</p><p>“It’s an expression, honey,” Agatha clarified with a smile. “Go get ready and I’ll be up in a minute.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and slid from his stool, moving quickly with his bowl to place it by the sink before he ran away upstairs.</p><p>In the quiet of the kitchen Rio felt suddenly nervous, suddenly exposed. She watched as Agatha took up the stool beside her and reach her hand halfway across the distance between them along the cool marble countertop.</p><p>“Did you actually sleep okay? Because-…”</p><p>“I didn’t sleep at all.”</p><p>Rio placed her hand cautiously by Agatha’s on the counter and stretched her fingers out so the pads of hers could brush over Agatha’s nails.</p><p>She watched as Agatha looked down at the movement and saw her biting her lip.</p><p>“Did you?”</p><p>“You know I don’t sleep.”</p><p>Agatha raised her fingers enough then to capture Rio’s as they moved down again and she interlocked their fingers in a move that made Rio’s heart stutter.</p><p>She took a breath and looked up to see Agatha watching her cautiously.</p><p>“Didn’t you take a pill?”</p><p>“No, I wasn’t sure if… no, I decided not to.”</p><p>Rio nodded and swallowed down the unspoken between them: she could have gone to Agatha in the night.</p><p>She frowned slightly and looked down at their hands.</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s breath away when she rubbed her thumb in small circles against Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Can you stay? It won’t take long to drop Nicky off and I don’t have to be anywhere until the afternoon.”</p><p>“I have wardrobe fittings today,” Rio said quietly, mesmerised by the thumb still brushing slowly over her skin.</p><p>It felt unreal, unbelievable. Like Rio had found the road to El Dorado. Only the gold was instead a goddess and Rio would worship at her feet if she asked her to.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered softly, snapping Rio from her daydreams of Agatha draped in white robes, wearing a laurel wreath and Rio feeding her grapes on a chaise.</p><p>Dark eyes moved up to meet light blue and that’s when Agatha moved.</p><p>She stood from her stool in one quick movement and pressed her lips to the corner of Rio’s mouth, her free hand just ghosting along Rio’s jaw.</p><p>Rio gasped quietly and turned her head to capture Agatha’s lips properly, and Agatha’s hand settled properly on her cheek as she kissed her back.</p><p>It was tender more than fierce. Gentle rather than greedy.</p><p>And Rio thought she’d die because of it.</p><p>She thought she’d cease to exist when Agatha pulled away from her. When she was denied the ability to simply live against Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“We can’t,” Agatha whispered as she pulled away. But she kissed Rio again. And then again. And Rio found herself pining in the half a second between each kiss.</p><p>It happened ten times, though Rio hadn’t counted. Hadn’t had the wherewithal to do so.</p><p>But Agatha was pulling away properly now and Rio actually whimpered because of it, actually fell from her stool and reached her free hand to brush hair behind Agatha’s ear and capture her lips again.</p><p>Now just an inch away from her, Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio’s waist and pressed her closer, their soft kisses truncated with soft breaths in between, brief and unconscious checks that the other wanted the next kiss.</p><p>But Rio could have done it forever.</p><p>She could have given up everything to just wait around for Agatha to kiss her like this. Just like this. She would make a promise to never press for more. Would simply always just wait patiently for Agatha to press her lips to hers whenever she wanted.</p><p>But Agatha was pulling away again, only this time moving so far that now the island was between them.</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair and Rio was pining again.</p><p>“We can’t,” Agatha repeated.</p><p>And Rio knew she was right.</p><p>Knew they were being too brazen with it.</p><p>She dropped her gaze to her coffee and pulled it towards her for something to do. For something to hold.</p><p>“I should go check on Nicky.”</p><p>“I should go change.”</p><p>Rio glanced up and saw her own pain reflected in Agatha’s gaze. It made her pine more.</p><p>“Friday,” Agatha said quietly, “Come over. Stay for the day.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, her gaze falling back to the hand she’d just been holding that now rested on the island.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said gently, forcing Rio to look up at her again. “I want to talk about this. About us.”</p><p>Rio nodded again but her tongue felt thick in her mouth because the reminder of Friday brought with it two things that made her feel sick: the first being that Agatha could easily tell her this wasn’t what she wanted. The second being that Ralph would be there in the evening, and Rio wouldn’t be able to look at her for fear she’d see Ralph too near, too close.</p><p>But Agatha was moving back around and touching Rio’s arm as she walked past, squeezing her forearm gently.</p><p>And Rio took just another second before she went to grab her discarded bag of dirty clothes from yesterday and she disappeared back to her assigned bedroom.</p><p>Once alone behind a closed door she changed quickly, folding Agatha’s pyjamas up and placing them neatly on the end of the bed. She checked the bathroom, and did one final check of the room to make sure she’d left it as pristine as she’d found it.</p><p>Once sure it was perfect, she left again in the clothes she’d worn when she arrived yesterday.</p><p>Only this was the worst walk of shame she’d ever experienced.</p><p>She’d been part of an affair.</p><p>She’d kissed and fucked and been fucked by a married woman.</p><p>She’d made plans to do it again. To talk it through. To continue the affair.</p><p>She hovered by the front door, killing time as she waited for Agatha and Nicky by checking her phone.</p><p>It had died.</p><p>Alice would kill her.</p><p>But five minutes later and Nicky was barrelling down the stairs and Rio looked up just as she saw the little boy appear in the hall, grinning at Rio with his backpack almost the same size as him on his back.</p><p>“Will you be back soon?”</p><p>Agatha had appeared behind him and Rio felt her stomach flip as she felt her eyes on her.</p><p>“Would I really want to miss learning from the best?”</p><p>Nicky’s smile turned shy and he reached to grab the straps of his backpack as Agatha moved closer and Rio caught the familiar scent of her perfume on the air.</p><p>It was torturous.</p><p>“Come on. Let’s get you to school.”</p><p>Rio caught Agatha’s eye and she paused for just a second before she stepped out of the way and felt the brush of Agatha’s arm against her own.</p><p>It had to be deliberate. She’d given her enough space.</p><p>Rio let Nicky go out before them and she looked up as Agatha met her gaze when she stepped past.</p><p>She looked tired, and somehow nervous.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t help herself when she stepped in and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. It was friendly, or as friendly as she could manage.</p><p>And she turned before she could see Agatha’s reaction.</p><p>Nicky was too interested in walking towards the outside gate anyway to much notice what his mother was doing so Rio felt confident she hadn’t overstepped.</p><p>She waited at the gate for Agatha to join them and watched as she tapped in the code so it would open onto the quiet street.</p><p>It felt like entering a different life, stepping out of Agatha’s arena and back into the tree-lined street.</p><p>But as the gate closed, Agatha had turned to catch her eye and reached for her arm.</p><p>“Friday?”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only turn as Nicky stepped towards his mom to take her hand and smile shyly at Rio again.</p><p>She forced herself to return the smile and turned from them both with a wave to find her little hybrid parked up the street.</p><p>Once in the safety of her car she released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding and stared at her steering wheel.</p><p>Had last night really happened? Had she just spent two precious minutes in Agatha’s kitchen, kissing her sweetly, allowing Agatha to hold her hand and wrap her arm around her?</p><p>She started the car and shook her head to herself, finding a discarded wire somewhere so she could plug in her phone and get out of there as quickly as possible.</p><p>Halfway down the freeway her phone lit up with Alice calling her and she grimaced as she pressed the button to answer and Alice’s tinny voice came through the speaker.</p><p>“Holy shit, Rio. I was so close to sending a search party. What happened?”</p><p>“I stayed over at Agatha’s.”</p><p>“You stayed over? What? The kid was so useless at basketball you had to run into extra time?”</p><p>“No. No. He’s cute. Sweet. I just… had too much wine to drive so Agatha told me to stay.”</p><p>“Please tell me you didn’t get drunk again.”</p><p>“No, Alice,” Rio said with a huff, wondering if this was what Alice was annoyed about then how she might feel about Rio being inside of the great Agatha Harkness just a few hours ago.</p><p>“I behaved.”</p><p>“Sure, whatever. Just get back soon. The costume guys will be here in less than an hour and I want to tell you all about me and Jen. And <em>you</em> can reassure me that you managed to charm Agatha.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but hung up.</p><p>The drive back home allowed her the time she needed to sort through her complicated feelings about what she’d done.</p><p>She knew she didn’t want to be the cause of anyone’s marriage breaking up. But she also knew she hated Ralph. And everything was currently pointing to Ralph being a prick so that hatred was justified.</p><p>She knew she liked Agatha. She was beginning to suspect that she might be falling for Agatha. She knew she wanted to kiss her and touch her and taste her.</p><p>She knew Agatha liked her. At least enough to be curious. At least enough to come within barely minutes of Rio admittedly not doing her best work on a couch when she’d been taken by surprise and was so shocked that she was even allowed to touch Agatha like that.</p><p>She knew that Agatha would be nervous and scared and the chances of her burning her carefully curated image down for Rio were next to zero.</p><p>Let alone her family.</p><p>She knew she’d never destroy her family for Rio.</p><p>Which left her with one choice: if she wanted Agatha she had to be a mistress. She had to be as discreet as possible. As available as she could make herself on the off-chance that Agatha had the time and the inclination to let her near her again.</p><p>She would have to get a handle on her feelings and treat this as just another girl she could have fun with. But even as she thought that, even as she agreed that in her mind, she felt her chest feel hollow with the idea that it could never be more.</p><p>That she could touch Agatha but never reach her.</p><p>No further through working through her feelings than she had been whilst tossing and turning in the bed the night before, Rio soon pulled up to her little house.</p><p>She spotted Alice’s car already parked up a little on the sidewalk and she rolled her eyes at the haphazard nature of it.</p><p>Sometimes she wondered how Alice managed to be so diligent and professional when it came to work but so clumsy and unbothered in her real life.</p><p>But she had little time to think on it as her own front door was flung open and Alice was there to greet her.</p><p>“Dirty stopout,” she proclaimed with a grin.</p><p>“Get in here. We don’t have long and I want all the details. Did she talk to you about working together? Was there any chat about-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio groaned as she stepped over the threshold, “Please. I’ve barely slept I-…”</p><p>“No, no. Don’t give me that. You have to work today. Tomorrow and Saturday you have to complain and sleep but this morning you’re working.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and threw her bag down as she traipsed through to the kitchen to source coffee.</p><p>She idly wondered what Agatha’s coffee of choice would be. Did she get only organic beans? Did she only shop in Erewhon? Probably.</p><p>“So, tell me!”</p><p>“We mostly spoke about Nicky. And a little about the circuit and-…”</p><p>Alice huffed softly but Rio ignored it as she stirred an ungodly amount of sugar into her coffee.</p><p>“We watched a movie and then we went to bed.”</p><p>“God. Well, the fact that she let you stay is positive. She could have called you a cab and been done with it.”</p><p>She nodded and swallowed down the horrifying idea that Agatha could have done just that even after what they’d done together on the couch.</p><p>But Alice soon moved onto the topic of her and Jen.</p><p>And Rio soon relaxed into the corner of her couch, watching but not really listening to her best friend.</p><p>She kept thinking about Agatha.</p><p>How she’d felt against her. How she’d looked at her during and afterwards.</p><p>How she’d been so soft this morning. How she’d kissed her over and over until she had to pull away. Twice.</p><p>And she thought of nothing but Agatha for the rest of the morning. After Alice had finished her romantic tale of how she’d told Jen she loved her and how Jen had said it back. After the costume department descended upon Rio’s little Spanish villa and poked and prodded at her for sizings and colour testing.</p><p>And then she was free to be alone for a while.</p><p>She showered and changed and decided that she couldn’t sit around and pine for a woman she may never have again. And even if she did, she’d have her only in ways that were physical. And secret.</p><p>She took herself off to her gym and threw her thoughts away as she pushed her tired body to the limit of what she could handle.</p><p>The text came as Rio was finishing up the workout.</p><p>The endorphins she’d sweat for dissolved in her brain and body as she read the words over and over.</p><p>She wasn’t an idiot.</p><p>She knew what they meant.</p><p>2:30pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Ralph will be home all day tomorrow. Some meetings have come up for me. You can’t come over early. Sorry.</p><p>Agatha had changed her mind.</p><p>Or maybe it was simply that she’d got what she wanted out of Rio.</p><p>And she’d been acting that morning, trying to soften the blow she knew she’d eventually deliver.</p><p>She’d had her orgasms, felt what it was to be with a woman, and decided it wasn’t for her.</p><p>Or simply that Rio wasn’t.</p><p>The only solace Rio could get from the situation was that at least she’d felt the touch of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>She was now one of the privileged three people in the world who had been deigned good enough to be inside of her, to hear her moan, to be pressed so close nothing else existed but <em>her</em>.</p><p>True to form, she didn’t text back.</p>

Sorry.</em></p><p><em>Agatha had changed her mind.</em></p><p><em>Or maybe it was simply that she’d got what she wanted out of Rio.</em></p><p><em>She’d had her orgasms, felt what it was to be with a woman, and decided it wasn’t for her.</em></p><p><em>The only solace Rio could get from the situation was that at least she’d felt the touch of Agatha Harkness.</em></p><p><em>She was now one of the privileged three people in the world who had been deigned good enough to be inside of her, to hear her moan, to be pressed so close nothing else existed but <em>her</em>.</em></p><p><em>True to form, she didn’t text back.</em></p><p>She spent the rest of the afternoon doing everything she could to not think about Agatha.</p><p>She cleaned her house within an inch of its life.</p><p>She did her laundry and tidied her clothes away, placing her favourite cowboy shirt in pride of place in her second drawer.</p><p>She called her mom and spoke to her for over two hours.</p><p>She threw herself into bed at 10pm and took a melatonin to help her drift off.</p><p>But the sting of it really settled in when Alice called to ask if she wanted a lift to Agatha’s house on Friday morning.</p><p>Alice was excited for the dinner and chatting away about the wine she’d bought especially for the occasion, about the outfit she was wearing because she knew Jen liked it and it wasn’t too smart or too casual.</p><p>It reminded Rio of the gifts she’d bought Agatha and Nicky when she went over two days ago.</p><p>Her mother’s empanadas and her own basketball jersey.</p><p>Sweet. Domestic.</p><p>Now a fantasy.</p><p>She’d been a fool to think it could be anything but.</p><p>Alice hadn’t been right that Agatha didn’t want her at all. But she had been right that if anything were to happen it would be a flash of desire, a quick fuck with no feelings and then nothing.</p><p>And Rio would be shunned because Agatha would make it so.</p><p>She’d push her from Hollywood because she could and because the fear of people knowing she’d stooped so low as to sleep with a barely-established actress like Rio would be enough to make her burn Rio’s career to the ground.</p><p>She could block her from the best producers, the best studios, the best directors.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Alice asked suddenly, making Rio snap from her doom spiral.</p><p>“What? Sorry. I didn’t sleep great.”</p><p>“Well snap out of it. Tonight’s important to me. Agatha is Jen’s best friend and I know you two are getting on now but you need to nail this. Not just for me but for your career.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but felt her stomach flip as she realised that her stupidity would impact Alice too.</p><p>If she were flung from Hollywood then Alice would be right behind her.</p><p>And what that meant for hers and Jen’s relationship, she didn’t know.</p><p>But Rio hadn’t spoken for a second or two and Alice was already filling the silence.</p><p>“Jen floated the idea of a joined project. Of something Agatha was producing. Just an idea still but I think if things keep going well then we might be in there.”</p><p>“As in… me and Agatha working together?”</p><p>“Yeah. I know she’s <em>Agatha Harkness</em> but you’re hot shit too. Don’t forget that. She’d be a fool to overlook you and the pull you have at the box office.”</p><p>Rio sighed and flopped down onto her floral bedspread, toying idly with the soft fabric by her hip.</p><p>“Besides in just a couple months time you’ll have an Oscar nomination and-…”</p><p>“Wait, wait. Alice.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and then fell onto her back, staring up at the ceiling as she said: “Has Agatha asked Jen about this? Has she given her some sort of-…”</p><p>“She’s optioning a movie and has you in mind for one of the roles, apparently. Don’t get your hopes up. It’s early days but just to say: keep on her good side. Being friendly with Agatha is your ticket to the best this town has to offer.”</p><p>Not long after, they hung up.</p><p>Rio had long since fallen into a deep depression, and she allowed herself to wallow in it for an hour only.</p><p>She timed it precisely. Keeping an eye on the clock on the side to make sure she didn’t slip into hour two of her self-pity party.</p><p>But her wallowing brought with it a determination to act, to protect, to reassure.</p><p>She couldn’t make Agatha want her. But she could protect Alice. She could ensure Agatha knew she’d protect her too.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, Agatha wouldn’t destroy more than her heart.</p><p>Pushing her heartache to the side, Rio focused for the rest of the day on building herself back up to a facsimile of an actress with the world at her feet and the kind of happy-go-lucky attitude she used to carry with her like a permanent badge of pride.</p><p>She went to the local market to buy fresh flowers and organic wine. She picked out a dress that was casual enough for a dinner at a friend’s but pretty enough to still look like she’d made an effort. She put on a little more makeup than she usually would, wore more jewellery, wore flattering lipstick and nice shoes.</p><p>In short, she did everything she could to look good, so she’d feel good too.</p><p>When Alice was outside her door at six, honking impatiently, Rio felt more energised, more ready to face Agatha than she had felt since she received the text.</p><p>“Goddamn, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio slipped in the car beside Alice and narrowly avoided smacking herself in the face with large bouquet of flowers.</p><p>“Pulled out all the stops? Or just got a date after this?”</p><p>Rio smirked a little, pleased her choice to dress up had an immediate affect, even if Alice weren’t the intended audience.</p><p>“Just wanted to look good for our host.”</p><p>Not a lie.</p><p>Alice hummed and started the car back up as Rio looked her best friend over with a small smile.</p><p>“You look good, superstar. If I didn’t know any better I’d think you were trying to seduce your girlfriend.”</p><p>“I’m <em>always</em> trying to seduce Jen. By Sunday we’ll be away again so I need to squeeze in as much seduction as possible.”</p><p>“You can stay, you know? If it’s easier? I know you get so bored. And now you have Jen, well, it’s different.”</p><p>Alice shot Rio a sideways glance and Rio knew what she was about to say before she even said it: “You need me around. You get lonely.”</p><p>“I do not.”</p><p>Alice just raised her brows and Rio sighed and turned her head to look out the car window.</p><p>“It’s time to find someone.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“I mean it. You’re cute and funny and <em>kind</em> and rich and-…”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>“After the Oscar’s. Four more months. I want you to seriously consider getting out there. You’ve not had a proper girlfriend since college.”</p><p>“Not true. Victoria was-…”</p><p>“You saw her for six months then decided you weren’t in love.”</p><p>“And? Still a girlfriend.”</p><p>“It was an extended affair.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, knowing Alice was right. Victoria had been a warm body who knew how Rio liked to be touched and how to make good coffee and where the best bars were in any city in the world.</p><p>But they hadn’t really talked. They hadn’t shared things or welcomed each other into one another’s lives.</p><p>It was just convenient. Just easier than having no one.</p><p>“Besides,” Alice was continuing, taking Rio’s silence as an invitation to go on.</p><p>“I want to see you happy. To see you settled.”</p><p>“Don’t lie. You think it’ll be good for the brand.”</p><p>“Don’t be a bitch. You’re my friend before you’re my client. I’ve not been this happy in a long time and that’s because of Jen. I want that for you too.”</p><p>Rio felt her chest constrict as she thought of what could have been with Agatha.</p><p>Was there a universe where Agatha had left Ralph and run away with Rio? Could she have seen herself as a step-mom to Nicky? Would they work longterm? Would Agatha get bored of her or decide a fleeting fantasy of Rio wasn’t as good as the reality?</p><p>But then a hand had reached across, and amidst the forest of fresh flowers, Alice had linked their fingers and was squeezing Rio firmly.</p><p>“I love you. I want you to be happy. You deserve someone who will make you happy.”</p><p>But Rio found she couldn’t respond.</p><p>She only squeezed Alice’s hand and tried to funnel into it the acknowledgement of her friend’s care.</p><p>They remained silent for the rest of the short journey into the Hills and by the time they arrived Rio had schooled her thoughts again to be ready to act rings around her own emotions.</p><p>They traipsed up to the gate and waited for the familiar sound of it unlocking, Rio watching Alice with amusement as she took everything in.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio laughed even as the door opened and Agatha appeared in the doorway.</p><p>She was in a striped blue and white button down and matching white jeans. She had a pair of glasses on her head and a hardness to her expression that made Rio want to turn and run.</p><p>“Agatha!” Alice shouted with a grin, moving towards the woman with a beam and brandishing her wine, “this place is… <em>huge</em>.”</p><p>Agatha only smiled tightly, stepping aside to let Alice in and offering only a cursory hug as the smaller woman stepped inside and muttered another, “holy shit”, once she’d seen the inside of the house.</p><p>“Ralph and Jen are out back.”</p><p>“I’ll put this in the kitchen,” Alice said happily as she slowly stepped away and gazed all around her in awe of what money and taste could produce.</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to step up now and she did so with a fear that so clenched her heart she could barely breathe.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t reached for her or even offered the small hug she’d deigned to give Alice.</p><p>Her blue eyes were focused on the floor and Rio sucked in a sharp breath at the sight of Agatha’s jaw flexing before her.</p><p>The jaw she’d brushed her lips and tongue and teeth across only two nights ago.</p><p>“Hi,” she offered softly, turning fully to Agatha in the open doorway, unsure whether or not ignoring her would be a better option.</p><p>“I thought it meant more than that,” Agatha said in a venomous whisper that chilled Rio’s very soul.</p><p>Agatha moved then, still not exactly looking at her as she made to close the door behind her and Rio had to shift quickly to avoid it closing on her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>But Agatha raised her gaze to her and Rio was thunderstruck by what she saw in it.</p><p>Agatha looked hurt.</p><p>She looked devastated.</p><p>“Not glam enough for you? Not fun and sexy with a kid in tow and-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Rio felt a prickling sense of shame tickle her body, hitting every inch of her with it’s creeping tendrils and it’s insidious promise of pain.</p><p>“You called it off.”</p><p>But as soon as the words left her lips she could see in them a truth she’d missed before. Perhaps because she’d expected Agatha to call it off. Perhaps because she’d assumed she would or maybe, just maybe, she’d hoped that she’d do it sooner rather than later to save Rio falling more for her.</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed a little but she still looked just as hurt as before, her face just as taught.</p><p>They stared at each other for what felt like a lifetime, and Rio took a step closer even as Agatha took a step back, her body coming into contact with the closed front door behind her.</p><p>Agatha took a soft breath.</p><p>And Rio had never seen her eyes sparkle like that before.</p><p>But it wasn’t something she ever wanted to see again because Agatha was fighting tears.</p><p>“Ralph was here. I had meetings. I couldn’t get away and you couldn’t come to me.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p>There was a noise then through in the kitchen that made Agatha’s gaze dart from Rio’s for the first time since she’d looked up, and Rio felt in the absence of it a sudden sinking feeling of panic overwhelm her.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t pulled away. Agatha had simply had to change plans.</p><p>But now Agatha was walking past her and Rio swallowed thickly where her perfume filled her lungs and she had to fight to remain cognisant of the role she had to play today.</p><p>It was different to the one she’d assumed it would be.</p><p>She wasn’t a spurned lover.</p><p>She was a grovelling one.</p><p>She turned to follow Agatha into the kitchen and found Ralph in there with her.</p><p>He looked handsome. And Rio felt sick that he was there. In his kitchen. Where he had every right to be when Rio was just there to make up the numbers, to keep Alice company.</p><p>He was opening a bottle of red and indulgently sniffing the cork. “Beautiful bouquet on this one.”</p><p>Agatha was fetching another glass before placing it on the side, glancing at Rio as she did.</p><p>She’d pulled back the tears that had threatened to spill but still looked haunted.</p><p>Rio’s nausea increased.</p><p>She forced herself to look away and swallowed the sickness down.</p><p>“Pinot isn’t for me. Tastes like juice. I prefer a Barolo. Fuller bodied,” Rio said in Ralph’s direction, even as her eyes moved back to Agatha as the woman moved forwards to take her flowers from her.</p><p>“Oh no, a Pinot Noir for me. Much lighter. That way you can enjoy the fruits.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t much care for Ralph’s opinion on wine, or anything at all for that matter.</p><p>Agatha’s hand had just grazed her own when she took the flowers from her and Rio felt her whole body react to it as if she had burned her with a lit match.</p><p>“Ralph,” Agatha said as she turned away from Rio, moving to a cabinet to fetch a vase.</p><p>“Enough wine talk. Go entertain our guests and top up their glasses. I’ll be out with Rio in a second.”</p><p>Ralph didn’t object to this but then Rio supposed he wouldn’t, would he? It was Agatha who was the catch here. Agatha with the millions and the face that could launch a thousand ships.</p><p>And Ralph was just a man.</p><p>Left alone again, Rio placed the tote bag with the bottle of wine she’d brought on the side and remained silent as she turned her gaze to Agatha who seemed intent on the flowers she was currently arranging.</p><p>“You thought I’d had my way with you and were done?”</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence and Rio felt the sickness settle in the base of her throat.</p><p>“Or maybe you thought I’d changed my mind? I’d faked it and lied to you?”</p><p>Agatha’s tone hadn’t softened as she transitioned from instructing Ralph to berating Rio and Rio flinched with it, moving slowly closer.</p><p>“I thought-…”</p><p>“You could have at least had the decency to tell me. To use your words, Rio. God knows you use them enough any other time. I am not some slut you fuck and then ignore.”</p><p>It would have been easier if Agatha had slapped her.</p><p>But she persevered, being braver now than she had been when she had assumed Agatha didn’t want her anymore.</p><p>She moved close, placing her hand on the island by Agatha’s hip and when she didn’t react or pull away she moved it to her body to get her to turn to her.</p><p>Agatha resisted for a second before she did, and Rio felt her heart thrum in her chest when she realised that Agatha wasn’t looking at her but her eyes had gone that same watery way again.</p><p>She raised her hand cautiously to cup Agatha’s cheek and lifted her head up to look at her properly.</p><p>It was dangerous. Too out in the open.</p><p>There would be no good excuse if anyone walked in.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care. And Agatha clearly didn’t either.</p><p>“I assumed you’d got what you wanted out of me and I didn’t know what to say. But I wanted to come here and let you know that even if that were true, that I’d never tell anyone what happened. You’d always be safe with me.”</p><p>“Don’t say things like that,” Agatha breathed softly, as she moved her hands to the collar of Rio’s dress.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head and pulled away, her fingers tightening their hold and then releasing suddenly, and Rio felt like she’d faint as her own hand hovered in the space between them.</p><p>“We can’t do this. The other night was a mistake.”</p><p>“Agatha, don’t. Please.”</p><p>“I got carried away. I wasn’t thinking straight.”</p><p>Rio took a sharp breath in and reached back out for Agatha, this time stepping close so she could wrap an arm around her front and reach for her hip.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away, she simply remained standing, her gaze down on one of the daisies hanging limping from the bouquet. She touched it lightly as Rio’s fingers curled more tightly around her hip.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“It’s best for both of us,” Agatha said quietly, turning her head to look at Rio who was now just inches away.</p><p>And Rio knew she was right, knew she was doing to right thing. And that it was only Agatha who could decide. After all, it was her marriage.</p><p>But it hurt. It hurt beyond reason.</p><p>She met Agatha’s gaze and saw her blue irises begin to swirl again with unshed tears and she couldn’t believe it when she felt herself nod and pull away.</p><p>And Agatha opened her mouth as if to say something but Rio had turned away quickly for fear she’d fall to her knees and grovel if she didn’t.</p><p>She made quick strides towards the doors and didn’t turn back to see Agatha watching her.</p><p>Outside in the still warm September sun, Rio saw a discarded basketball on the deck and thought of the little boy who must have left it there.</p><p>She thought of his smile and his charm that was so like his mother’s.</p><p>And the evening she’d spent with both of them. Of the world now completely shut off from her grasp.</p><p>And then Ralph came into view, sitting in one of the armchairs and grinning across at Rio as she approached.</p><p>She’d been right the first time.</p><p>There was none of him in Nicky.</p><p>“There she is! Talking shop with my dear wife?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Rio said with a sweet smile, feeling the absence of the feel of Agatha against her never more than when she was in the presence of the husband.</p><p>“What took you so long?” Alice accused with a frown, her arm draped over Jen’s shoulders on the couch.</p><p>“I was helping with the flowers.”</p><p>“Jennifer,” Rio added with a smile as she went to sit by Alice’s side, leaving the second armchair free for Agatha.</p><p>“Vidal. Always a pleasure, never a chore.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she settled in, brushing her dress down over her legs and crossing them demurely.</p><p>It was easy to pretend. It was what she was good at.</p><p>“Trying to convince my client to star in some crappy chick flick with you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and tilted her head as Jen watched her suspiciously from the other end of the couch.</p><p>“I didn’t know that was an option for polite dinner party conversation. But I’ll be sure to bring it up.”</p><p>Jen scoffed and Alice nudged Rio gently even as she raised her brows down at her, wondering if this had anything to do with their phone conversation the previous day.</p><p>But Ralph had moved from his seat and was pouring Rio a wine without checking first that she wanted red when there was an open bottle of white that both Alice and Jen were drinking.</p><p>She thanked him anyway and took a sip of the Pinot Noir, a testament to her acting skills that she didn’t grimace at the thinness of it.</p><p>But she was distracted suddenly because Agatha was approaching, and she caught Rio’s eye.</p><p>Rio had to look away for fear she’d dissolve before her.</p><p>“Finally, the host!” Jen shouted with a grin, “took you long enough.”</p><p>“Actually I’m also the host,” Ralph said suddenly and Rio looked to Agatha’s reaction to this but saw she was too focused on Rio’s red wine, raising her brows at it.</p><p>“Sorry, Ralph. Of course. Just used to it being mostly Agatha, is all.”</p><p>Agatha had stood from her chair, pouring herself a glass of white before she went to take Rio’s wine without asking and swapped the glasses.</p><p>“Rio doesn’t like Pinot Noir.”</p><p>Everybody turned to stare at Agatha as Agatha made eyes at Ralph, taking her seat up again.</p><p>Rio blinked, her hand now curled around the cold cup of her new wine glass as she watched as Agatha took her seat and sipped at the deep burgundy liquid she’d just stolen away from Rio.</p><p>“She didn’t say no.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped in the direction of Ralph and she saw his eyes flash, a challenge to his wife for showing him up. Perhaps also Jen’s dismissal of his position as host getting to him too.</p><p>“But she told you in the kitchen she didn’t like it.”</p><p>This was more than just about wine.</p><p>Rio shifted slightly in her seat and looked back to Agatha, willing her to look her way and drop it.</p><p>“It’s just never good enough, is it?”</p><p>Rio felt the wind change around them, saw the flash in Agatha’s eyes and the twitch of her fingers against the red of her glass.</p><p>Ralph was staring at his wife, his free hand in a fist at his side, his gaze as cold as the wine in Rio’s glass.</p><p>“I think we got off topic here,” Jen said suddenly, panic lacing her voice as she sat forward from Alice and cleared her throat.</p><p>“Come on! You’re the dream couple! Cute kid, amazing house, both hot. It’s just wine. And Ralph’s right, Agatha. Rio didn’t say no.”</p><p>Rio felt this was a little unfair, she’d barely had time to and was being polite either way. Then, she supposed, she wasn’t being exactly polite when she was negotiating an affair with Ralph’s wife not minutes ago in the kitchen.</p><p>“You know what?”</p><p>Ralph had said suddenly, turning to Rio, “You didn’t say no and you also didn’t say you wanted the white. So we’re all at fault here. Which do you want, Rio?”</p><p>Rio knew this was a power play, that he was trying to get her on side, to manipulate her into going for the first choice but even if Agatha had handed her a cup of poison she’d have picked Agatha’s offering over his any day.</p><p>“I was being polite before. I don’t like Pinot Noir. I never have. But this,” Rio held up the glass and glanced briefly to Agatha. “This I’d drink any day of the week. Gladly so.”</p><p>They locked eyes and Rio thought she saw a flicker of the anguish she’d seen before in Agatha.</p><p>But she looked away quickly, unwilling to let herself get sucked in again.</p><p>Ralph scoffed and muttered something under his breath that made the atmosphere crackle with something dark and incendiary.</p><p>Alice’s hand flew to Rio’s leg and she dug her nails into her, turning her body ever so slightly towards her as if there were something coiled nearby ready to spring and Rio hadn’t seen it yet but she was in the predator’s vision.</p><p>Rio glanced at her best friend, saw in her eyes the panic that had caused her to turn to her and raised her brows in question.</p><p>But it was clear she’d missed something. That she hadn’t heard what Ralph had said.</p><p>But everyone else had.</p><p>“Ralph,” Jen had said quietly, shifting her weight ever so slightly forwards.</p><p>But Rio looked to Agatha and saw that she looked beyond reason suddenly, beyond any placatory tone that Jen may have used onto try and calm Ralph.</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, Alice’s grip on her upper thigh so tight she thought she’d rip her dress.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Rio asked suddenly, wanting to know why everyone was losing it. She dragged her gaze away from Agatha to look at Ralph who still looked furious but who wasn’t looking at anyone in particular, his gaze on the floor.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice warned quietly, but Ralph was already speaking again:</p><p>“I said: fucking flirt.”</p><p>Rio’s brows shot up her forehead and Agatha raised to her feet, repeating what she’d said earlier: “Get out.”</p><p>“Surely it’s enough to have your little fan club on set, on the red carpet, but not at my table, convincing my son to swap teams. Flirting with you so openly.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand to Alice’s still clutching at her thigh and she went to extricate it gently, and Alice allowed it.</p><p>Rio moved cautiously from her position on the couch to stand just behind Agatha and touched her forearm gently, curling her fingers slowly around it, her steady gaze on Ralph who’d turned to watch her move to his wife.</p><p>“Agatha, don’t.”</p><p>“You need to leave.”</p><p>Ralph didn’t move, his eyes briefly dropping to Rio’s hold on Agatha before he raised his gaze again and looked across at his wife.</p><p>He watched her for a second and Rio could only guess the coldness in Agatha’s eyes, but she remained where she was just behind her, her fingers tightening ever so slightly on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“I’m not homophobic,” Ralph said suddenly, sounding an awful lot like a homophobic person might.</p><p>“I don’t care that you’re gay. Or that you clearly have a crush on my wife.”</p><p>His gaze dropped down to Rio’s hand on Agatha’s arm again and Rio briefly wondered if he knew the fingers now clutching his wife’s arm had been inside of her if he’d change his mind on not caring about her crush.</p><p>He seemed to think on it, and his shoulders dropped a little.</p><p>“I was just getting back at you with the wine for Nicky, that’s all. He hasn’t taken the jersey off since he got it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this, wondering why he was so concerned about this when he’d barely acknowledged his son a couple days ago.</p><p>But Agatha beneath her hand was still tense and so Rio shoved down her instincts to tell this guy to fuck off and to be a better dad if someone who’d known his kid all of one day could overtake him in the rankings. She swallowed thickly and squeezed Agatha’s arm as she said: “It’s fine. I’ve been called worse.”</p><p>“And,” she started slowly as Agatha shifted, “I don’t have a crush on your wife. I actually find her very smug and annoying and,” she paused as she felt Agatha’s arm flex beneath her hand, making her second guess her choice but she had to say it, had to do it for the sake of keeping the peace as well as letting Agatha know she’d keep their tryst safe, “and she’s not my type at all.”</p><p>Rio could feel both Alice and Jen looking at her and she saw Ralph do the same, but the only reaction she really cared about was Agatha’s, though she only had the gentle second flex of her arm to go by.</p><p>“Well I’m sorry,” Ralph said a little stiffly, and Rio wondered whether he was simply uncomfortable with the conversation of a lesbian’s preferences in women, if he wanted to get back to drinking his disgusting wine, or if he wanted to be thought of as the host again, take back the power that Agatha had so swiftly gathered for herself.</p><p>Rio only nodded once, not offering her forgiveness back and squeezed Agatha’s arm gently before she returned to her seat.</p><p>Silence descended on the little group again as Rio watched Agatha sit down, her face as angry still as she’d ever seen it.</p><p>It was touching, really, a display of protectiveness she would never have expected from Agatha.</p><p>Especially not now.</p><p>Or maybe it was something else. A self-preservation. A defensiveness.</p><p>And she didn’t take her eyes off of her until Agatha looked back up to her and Rio lost her nerve and looked away.</p><p>“Anyway,” Jen said quickly, still sitting on the edge of the couch where Alice had now stolen Rio’s free hand and was holding it hidden down against her own hip, looking a little shell shocked.</p><p>“Rio. Details. Industry crushes. Go!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and cleared her throat quietly, squeezing Alice’s hand reassuringly before stealing her own away again.</p><p>“Now that would be telling.”</p><p>“Oh come on,” Jen said with her own raised brows and a look that said to Rio: ‘please keep the conversation going’.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio relented, but only to get the conversation flowing again. She panicked and her mind went blank suddenly and she stared at Jen like she’d never been asked a question before in her life.</p><p>“Wanda,” Alice added quickly, nudging Rio’s thigh, “Wanda. You like Wanda.”</p><p>“Yes, but-…”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly, realising there was no point protesting when she had to come up with a name anyway and Alice had just done that for her.</p><p>“Wanda. Right.”</p><p>“The redhead?” Ralph asked curiously and Rio turned to him and nodded, feeling suddenly a little disloyal to Wanda and a whole lot disloyal to Agatha.</p><p>Despite what they’d just agreed in the kitchen.</p><p>But Ralph looked totally at ease again as if he hadn’t just insulted his guest and pissed off his wife.</p><p>Which infuriated Rio.</p><p>“She’s cute,” Jen was saying, which meant Rio had a chance to glance at Agatha who looked as if she’d just swallowed a very large pill as she drank down the last of her wine.</p><p>“She’s maybe going to be the only nomination for A24 this year. Sad, really. They had so much promise and just fucked it on all their marketing. Though the movie wasn’t great either.”</p><p>Agatha was staring at the table between them.</p><p>“We’re negotiating a little Christmas movie at the minute. Some big names attached, actually. Calderu, Kaplan, Maximoff, it’s an ensemble.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Jen scrunched her face up but Rio missed it, her gaze on Agatha still.</p><p>“Not the cancer one?”</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>“Cancer at Christmas. It’s poignant.”</p><p>“It’s crap. They sent it to Agatha but I passed immediately. Who’s Rio playing? Not part of the family surely? They’re all white.”</p><p>Before Alice could answer Agatha spoke for the first time since her last attempt to get Ralph to leave and she said, “Excuse me, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Rio met Agatha’s gaze for a split second before she’d turned and left.</p><p>Her anger had morphed into something else, something that made Rio shift in her seat.</p><p>There was a pause and then Ralph followed her down and Rio didn’t turn away until they’d both disappeared into the house.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio. Are you okay?”</p><p>Alice turned to her immediately and placed her hand on her leg over where she’d been holding her so tightly earlier.</p><p>“He gets wound up,” Jen said softly, looking over at Rio with a gentle frown, “they both do. I tell Agatha she just needs to have sex with him more and they’ll be fine.”</p><p>Rio wondered if Jen knew how much sex Agatha were actually having with her husband but felt it best to not broach the topic.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“I’m telling you, usually if things like that happen she screams at him until she runs out of breath. It was impressive, how you handled her.”</p><p>“I didn’t ‘handle’ her. I just…”</p><p>But Rio wasn’t really sure what she did and so she went quiet and took a sip of her wine.</p><p>“How she’s married to him, I don’t know.” Alice said with a deep frown as she turned in the direction Agatha and Ralph had disappeared to.</p><p>Jen sighed quietly, “Look, if it works it works, okay? He’s usually away and so is she and… anyway, her and Nicky are very happy.”</p><p><em> ‘Happily married’</em>, Rio thought bitterly.</p><p>“I saw a photo of him on the wall,” Alice said absently, swirling her wine, her frown still across her features, “he doesn’t look like Ralph.”</p><p>“Are you suggesting Agatha had an affair?”</p><p>“No, just, I thought he looked like Rio, actually.”</p><p>Rio blinked across at Alice and stared at her for longer than would be considered polite.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Well he’s got dark eyes and a goofy smile and big buck teeth.”</p><p>“I do not have big buck teeth.”</p><p>Alice ignored this.</p><p>“Plus he’s a little tan and I just thought… yeah, there’s Rio’s kid.”</p><p>“That is-…”</p><p>“Now you mention it, it’s not that crazy,” Jen said with a frown, staring into Rio’s face as if she were mapping out what features of hers Nicky had stolen.</p><p>“Actually, not at all. Sure he’s not yours and Agatha didn’t just steal him?”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>But a sudden movement from down the way alerted them to Agatha marching back up to them and Rio forgot all about their conversation as she entered the little secluded veranda.</p><p>“Ralph’s taking a work call.”</p><p>Rio didn’t believe this, and neither did the other two if their expressions were anything to go by.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said with a smile, “we were just saying-…”</p><p>But she lost her train of thought as Agatha, instead of taking her chair back again, stood before Rio and hovered awkwardly there, earning a frown from Jen and raised brows from Rio.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio shook her head slightly, frowning up at Agatha who was almost leaning over her.</p><p>The look she’d noticed before hadn’t been sadness, it had been longing.</p><p>“It’s fine. He didn’t mean it.”</p><p>But Agatha pursed her lips and slowly pulled away, reaching to fill everyone’s glasses with the right wine.</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and started again: “Agatha, we were saying how much Nicky looks like Rio.”</p><p>A soft sound of glass on glass rang out as Agatha accidentally knocked the lip of the bottle on Rio’s wine glass.</p><p>“Well….”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘well’?”</p><p>Rio blinked across at Agatha and watched as she slowly turned to look up at her, “Well… he does.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Alice snorted beside her and Rio turned to slap her, “I’m sorry? Is everyone listening to themselves? Your son doesn’t look like me.”</p><p>“I mean, he does,” Jen said with an unhelpful grin.</p><p>“He does a little,” Agatha said with a smile that made Rio soften to it just a little, the memory of what Agatha had told her two nights ago making her chest suddenly feel warm.</p><p>“Big eyes, sallow skin, goofy teeth.”</p><p>“And since when have I had goofy teeth?”</p><p>Even Agatha laughed a little at this and despite Rio’s outrage, she couldn’t help but be pleased they were all laughing now, all at ease without Ralph there.</p><p><em>Prick.</em></p><p>So she played it up a little, shooting for the rafters with a performance that would have killed in any theatre up and down the country.</p><p>“Poor me, being told I have goofy teeth and look like a little boy.”</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha said with a small smile that had taken the edge off of her sad eyes, sitting back more in her seat to enjoy this little performance, “a very <em>cute</em> little boy.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed heavily, receiving a nudge from Alice.</p><p>“At least you don’t need to bother having a kid now. Technically you already had one.”</p><p>“Oh, thanks.”</p><p>“I’m not sure Rio is the family type,” Jen said with a smirk, “given the amount of women she runs through.”</p><p>Jen turned her attention to Agatha, “Alice was telling me when she moved into her new house it was a new one every night for a week.”</p><p>“Jesus, Jen. Some discretion please.” Alice said suddenly, clearly concerned Rio’s penchant for running through girls would put Agatha off associating with her.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze was still on Rio and it had softened a little, the laughter in her face gone as she took her in, and Rio blushed a little bit didn’t turn away.</p><p>That was then, she thought. She’d never touch another woman for as long as she lived if Agatha asked her not to.</p><p>But she hadn’t. She wouldn’t.</p><p>It was none of Agatha’s concern what she’d do.</p><p>“I’m not saying it’s <em>bad</em>. I just think it’s not for Rio.”</p><p>“She was good with him,” Agatha said suddenly, breaking their gaze as she turned to Jen and Rio saw the sadness return in her. “Really good. Ralph’s right to be jealous about that. Nicky loved her. He doesn’t light up like that with his father.”</p><p>“I’m sure I was just new and exciting, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha looked back to Rio and raised her brows at this show of modesty, tilting her head a little, “He’s not like that with most people. Anyone else, actually.”</p><p>“He likes me,” Jen protested with a frown.</p><p>“You scare him.”</p><p>“Oh. Because I wore a red light mask around him <em>one</em> time.”</p><p>Rio scoffed out a laugh and Alice grinned at her girlfriend. “You did not.”</p><p>“Good skin care waits for no one.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio caught her eye. For a second, it was just the two of them again and Rio felt like moving over, taking Agatha’s hand and draping herself across her lap, curling around her.</p><p>She felt like asking her if she’d change her mind.</p><p>But Alice nudging her brought her back to real life and she turned with raised brows.</p><p>“Isn’t that right?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Plan: get Vidal a girlfriend.”</p><p>“Not this again. <em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up. It’s just us.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and felt her cheeks flush under Agatha’s intense gaze.</p><p>“Rio is going to get herself a girlfriend as soon as the awards season is done. She needs one. She’s getting old and lonely and it’s sad.”</p><p>Rio made a noise between a squeal and a scoff and slapped Alice’s arm. “Says the woman two months older than me who only just got a girlfriend.”</p><p>“That’s different.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“I was never lonely.”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em> lonely.”</p><p>“Tell us again how many women you had over the first week in your new place?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes around at Jen and attempted to lean around Alice to slap her arm but Alice nudged her away with ease.</p><p>“So,” Jen said as if she hadn’t been interrupted. “How do you plan on getting this girlfriend?”</p><p>Rio turned slowly to Agatha and was surprised to see that she looked a little spaced.</p><p>“I’m not. I’m just going to-…”</p><p>“Start texting people back, firstly,” Alice said with a grin.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but caught Agatha’s arched brow and huffed a little, “I’m busy.”</p><p>“I think if you want a girlfriend Alice is right. You have to text people back.”</p><p>Rio blinked as Agatha looked back around to her and she suddenly wanted to scream. She suddenly wanted to shout at Agatha and tell her that it wouldn’t have mattered anyway because Agatha wasn’t interested.</p><p>But she didn’t. She couldn’t.</p><p>She dropped her gaze.</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her disgusting wine and inclined her head a little.</p><p>“I know if it were <em>me</em> you were trying to date then I would appreciate a text back.”</p><p><em>Pushing it</em>, Rio thought with a scowl.</p><p>“I think you’ve forgotten I don’t have a crush on you. So you don’t need to worry about me trying to date you. I’m not interested.”</p><p>Rio looked up then and caught a flash of emotion in Agatha’s gaze. A glimmer of hurt. Or of triumph. She wasn’t sure.</p><p>But Agatha hummed even as Alice piped up again and Rio began to wonder at what point her best friend had turned into a traitor.</p><p>“Oh, I’m afraid that’s a lie too.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Oh you’re friends now. Ralph’s not here. Agatha, Rio <em>does</em> have a crush on you. She was all worried about it for a while but has calmed down now. I think seeing you in a bikini in Italy freaked her-…”</p><p>But Rio had slapped her friend’s arm and Jen was laughing beside her.</p><p>“Oh I think it’s clear she’s only interested in one thing. Right, Rio?”</p><p>Agatha asked softly and Rio heard the accusation in her tone and felt it deep within her bones.</p><p>She wanted to scream again.</p><p>Instead she sucked in her cheeks and watched as Agatha’s gaze fell from her, sweeping down to her hand that held the wine she’d given her and remaining there.</p><p>“But maybe Wanda doesn’t mind you picking up a different girl every night of the week.”</p><p>Rio bristled, not quite believing what Agatha was accusing her of. That she’d even suggest what she thought she was suggesting.</p><p>She turned away, deciding not to give Agatha the satisfaction.</p><p>Agatha had gone from furious to soft and then repeated the pattern again.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t get a grasp on it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want her and yet she was pushing her further away when Rio had already agreed she’d step back, that it had been a mistake that wouldn’t be repeated.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Agatha knock back her glass of wine.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?” Jen asked suddenly, lowering her wine glass from her lips and frowning deeply at the two of them.</p><p>“The vibes are off.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and flexed her jaw, unable to steady her racing heart and the anger that threatened to spill over.</p><p>“They’re just teasing, aren’t you, Rio?” Alice asked suddenly and Rio heard the pleading in her voice and looked around at her, managing only a quick nod.</p><p>But she couldn’t give anything else because her brain was going a mile a minute.</p><p>Agatha clearly thought she’d used her. A quick fuck and she was done.</p><p>How she’d come to that conclusion Rio had no idea but she couldn’t pry now.</p><p>She just had to silently take what she threw at her and focus on getting through the evening.</p><p>She could do it. She could do it for Alice.</p><p>Alice turned to look around at Jen and she smiled a little tensely, “Anyway, Wanda’s playing Rio’s wife in the Christmas movie Agatha turned down.”</p><p>“Oh? There weren’t any lesbians in that movie.”</p><p>“No,” Alice said with a shrug, “Wanda got the role and then asked if her husband could become her wife and… she got Rio hired.”</p><p>Rio was staring determinedly at her own knee now, only vaguely aware of the conversation around her and Agatha as she reached over to fill her own glass again.</p><p>“It’s cute actually,” Alice said with an innocent smile, “They’ve hired a kid who looks like Rio. Not as much as Nicky, obviously. Agatha, ever thought about putting Nicky to work?”</p><p>But Rio looked up now and saw the fury in Agatha’s gaze before she managed to school it somewhat, shaking her hair back and settling back in her armchair.</p><p>“Rio and Wanda? With my child?”</p><p>Oh, Agatha was mad as hell. And Rio felt a sick sort of satisfaction for it.</p><p>But more than that, she had to stop herself from grabbing her friend to get her to stop digging a hole.</p><p>But Alice was oblivious, seeing only the logic in it where Agatha was seeing none of it.</p><p>“Yeah! He looks like Rio, he <em>likes</em> Rio. It would be a win win!”</p><p>Rio was surprised that Agatha’s glass hadn’t snapped in two in her hand and her gaze fell to it briefly before she raised her eyes back up to Agatha’s face and she cleared her throat softly.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flickered to her before she looked away and took a deliberate sip of her wine.</p><p>“Nicky isn’t interested in acting.”</p><p>Not a lie, Rio assumed. But not the reason Nicky wouldn’t be playing the role of her and Wanda’s child.</p><p>“The poor pressure on the kid,” Jen said with a smile, “Imagine he wasn’t as good as his mother. That he didn’t get two Oscar’s by the time he was forty.”</p><p>“One,” Alice murmured quietly and Rio arched a brow, tearing her attention away from Agatha to briefly glance at her best friend.</p><p>“Let’s not fight. We know it’ll be Agatha.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said slowly, looking back to Agatha and watching curiously as she flexed a muscle in her jaw. “It won’t be either of us and someone else will win. Maybe Wanda.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed around to meet Rio’s teasing brown and Rio couldn’t believe that she’d spent so long thinking that Agatha wasn’t interested when she was practically about to explode upon the mere mention of Wanda.</p><p>That even now, when Agatha had told her they couldn’t continue, she was still jealous.</p><p>It felt too good to be true. And yet. Agatha looked mutinous.</p><p>“Her movie was a mess and her publicity-…”</p><p>“The photos of us in Venice?”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a warning look that Jen caught and she leant forwards in her chair, frowning at them both.</p><p>“Wait. What am I missing? The two of you… something’s going on.”</p><p>Agatha’s face morphed into something else then, something closed off and Rio bit down in her lip before looking over at Jen and feigning ignorance she asked: “What do you mean?”</p><p>“There’s… something I picked up in Italy. And it’s happening again only it’s… different.”</p><p>“Huh,” Rio said with a raised brow, shifting in her seat to turn her body slightly more towards Alice.</p><p>She felt a little uneasy about this assessment and shot a subtle look to Agatha who had handled this a lot better than her and had shaken her hair out behind her again, looking directly at her best friend with an unamused expression.</p><p>“Didn’t you tell me to be nice to Rio for Alice’s sake?”</p><p>This was news to Rio. News she didn’t exactly welcome.</p><p>But she knew Agatha was playing her role perfectly.</p><p>Jen bristled a little and even Alice frowned at this news.</p><p>“Well… I said be nice. I didn’t say-…”</p><p>“Didn’t say what, Jen? Invite Rio over for dinner so Alice would feel more comfortable?”</p><p>Rio fought the urge to fidget where she sat but she couldn’t give over any more power. She’d already lost so much that night.</p><p>And that hurt more than she’d been prepared for.</p><p>“Well… maybe I said it but…”</p><p>Alice sat forwards slightly and Rio cleared her throat, “I can leave if it’s easier on everyone.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous,” Alice said quickly, and Rio saw the panic in her eyes as she turned to her, her warm hand now resting on Rio’s bare knee.</p><p>But Alice’s wasn’t the reaction she wanted to check.</p><p>She turned to Agatha and saw that her eyes were focused on Alice’s hand resting against Rio and if she didn’t know any better she might think she looked jealous.</p><p>“Agatha?” She asked suddenly, wanting to know if this was really futile, if she were truly unwanted and unwelcome. “Do you want me to leave?”</p><p>It felt the way moving through thick snow felt.</p><p>Your body warm, hot, too hot even with the effort of it. Your feet and legs heavy as they tried to power your body through. Your lips stinging with the cold even as your cheeks flushed a soft pink. And Rio felt it then. Felt the heat and the heaviness and the sting.</p><p>She felt the incremental movement of Agatha’s eyes as she dragged them from where Alice’s hand still rested on her knee, up Rio’s torso and eventually, blessedly, meeting her gaze.</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped at the sight of her.</p><p>At the softness in her gaze, at the gentle way she was looking at her, so different from just two minutes ago, at the twitch of her fingers as they rested on the armrest, ever so slightly stretching towards her.</p><p>And she shook her head. Twitched it only an inch to the side. But it was a shake nonetheless.</p><p>Rio felt like a hand had been released from around her throat and she had to look away from Agatha again. Suddenly unsure if she should have even asked; thinking maybe she should have just left.</p><p>“Well,” Jen started again, frowning suspiciously at her best friend, “now that’s sorted, can we go back to having a nice time please?”</p><p>Alice squeezed Rio’s knee and shot her a confused look before she pulled her hand back and cleared her throat.</p><p>“So, <em>Heartburn</em> next, right? Rio was desperate for that. But I think you’ll be incredible. I mean… you always are.”</p><p>Rio glanced sideways at Alice and then was brave enough to look back to Agatha and saw her smile tensely, her whole demeanour completed changed again.</p><p>She looked lost in the conversation, her mind elsewhere and determinedly not looking at Rio.</p><p>And Rio kept up appearances for the next five minutes, nodding and smiling as the two beside her on the couch picked up the slack and Agatha contributed even a little.</p><p>But Rio needed some air and so excused herself to go to the bathroom, ignoring the look on Alice’s face as she did.</p><p>She didn’t turn around to see Agatha’s face.</p><p>She made it down to the house before she realised she was being followed and turned just in time for Alice’s hand to curl around her arm and for her to whisper urgently, “What’re you doing?”</p><p>Rio just shrugged out of her hold and finished the route to the ground floor bathroom.</p><p>Once inside, with Alice slipping in behind her, she sighed heavily, “Nothing. Nothing’s happening.”</p><p>“It is. I thought you and Agatha were good. You both look distraught.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and went to the mirror, and saw some of what Alice was saying. She’d looked happier. She’d looked better.</p><p>“Rio, what happened?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Fine. Don’t tell me. Whatever. But please, whatever it is, try to fix it. We’re in <em>such</em> a good position with Agatha on side. Just… sort it out.”</p><p>Rio sighed again and dropped her head as Alice left her alone in the bathroom.</p><p>There was no use. It was pointless to think that she’d be able to fix this. She’d tried to reassure Agatha that her secret was safe with her and yet Agatha was lashing out, and then freezing her out completely and watching her like she’d been the one to break this off.</p><p>Like Rio was to blame.</p><p>Agatha was angry and sad and Rio didn’t know how to fix it because she felt exactly the same.</p><p>Only she couldn’t lash out because that would draw even more attention to it and Rio had already promised that what had happened between them would be safe as houses with her.</p><p>She wondered if she had just text back what might have been. Would Agatha have still pulled away? Still acted like she despised her?</p><p>But Rio Vidal hadn’t made it to where she was by cowering away.</p><p>She brushed down her dress and ran a hand through her hair and took one last look at herself before she stepped from the bathroom and strode back out.</p><p>She found that everyone had migrated to the kitchen, and even Ralph had made his unwelcome presence known again. Everyone was sat around the island with Agatha the other side chopping up leeks.</p><p>She didn’t look up when Rio entered the room.</p><p>“Ah the prodigal actress has returned,” Jen called out with a smirk, and Ralph hurried from his stool to offer it to Rio.</p><p>She wanted to refuse but suddenly she felt Agatha’s eyes on her again and so she took it, if only to keep the peace.</p><p>“Did I miss anything?”</p><p>Alice passed Rio her glass that she’d saved from outside and Rio accepted it with a small smile, taking a large sip to try and calm the nerves that were again bubbling in her chest.</p><p>“No, just-…”</p><p>The soft music playing in the background filtered into Rio’s conscious then as the infamous chords struck up.</p><p>The world slowed and Rio’s gaze landed on Agatha and she saw that she’d recognised it too.</p><p>Her knife slipped and she cut a gash in her right thumb as Lindsey Buckingham’s voice filled the room.</p><p><em>“Loving you, isn’t the right thing to do.”</em></p><p>Rio stood as Agatha gasped and raised her bleeding thumb to her mouth to quell the bleed and she moved around to take her to the sink and help her rinse it.</p><p>“Ah! Rio, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Here,” Rio insisted calmly, barely thinking as she held Agatha’s hand gently under the cool water.</p><p>“Just rinse it.”</p><p>“You okay, hon?” Ralph asked from somewhere behind them and Rio felt sick as Agatha’s fingers curled around her own.</p><p>“Fine. Turn the damn song off,” Agatha huffed, even as her hold remained gentle against Rio.</p><p>Rio glanced at her before she pulled away and saw that Agatha looked far from the distant and angry she’d seemed earlier and instead looked pained. And Rio didn’t think it was because of the cut.</p><p>“Bandaids?” She asked quietly, only vaguely aware that the song had now changed and talk had picked up behind them.</p><p>“Second drawer on the right.”</p><p>Rio nodded and went to dry her hands on a dish cloth nearby before she sought a bandaid in a neatly laid out drawer.</p><p>She initially grabbed a normal looking box full of them and then spotted a second box with different images on it and smiled to herself as she rummaged to find what she was looking for.</p><p>She returned to Agatha’s side with a paper towel to help dry the area and the special bandaid she’d picked for the occasion.</p><p>Agatha winced a little at the light pressure of the towel against the small cut but Rio mumbled, “It should heal quickly. It’ll just sting for a bit.”</p><p>“You seem to know an awful lot about first aid.”</p><p>“Grew up with permanently grazed knees.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and Rio caught her smiling a little before her gaze dropped to the bandaid now half on her thumb.</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I have an Oscar.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Those are Nicky’s.”</p><p>“Then he has good taste.”</p><p>Rio lifted Agatha’s hand to inspect her handiwork and smirked up at Agatha, looking past her new addition to her thumb of a bandaid covered in cowboy hats and grinning at her.</p><p>“Juvenile.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio had to resist the urge to kiss the patient and instead behaved herself and released Agatha’s hand to return to her stool, making brief eye contact with Agatha again before she took a sip of wine.</p><p>The rush of being close, of touching Agatha was unlike anything else she’d ever felt before.</p><p>And she now found it difficult to look away.</p><p>The power of Fleetwood Mac and the witchy wonder of a song written for Stevie Nicks having cast a spell that broke the tension between them, that seemed to bring Agatha back out of herself, that made Rio wonder if she’d maybe change her mind and if Rio would allow it.</p><p>But she took another sip of wine and her eyes fell to Agatha’s thumb now sporting the cowboy bandaid and she knew she’d allow it.</p><p>She’d beg for it if she had to.</p><p>But she kept herself from looking at Agatha properly again as the conversation picked back up and Rio began to relax.</p><p>Maybe it was the wine.</p><p>Maybe it was the promise that maybe hope wasn’t dead.</p><p>Maybe it was that in spite of everything that had happened that night, Agatha had kept her promise of Rio sitting next to her at the table.</p><p>The excuse was that from this positioning it would be easier for her to get up to serve the food and easier for Ralph to fetch the wine.</p><p>Though Rio’s seat would have been good enough for either of these tasks.</p><p>No one said anything. Rio because she wanted to sit beside Agatha, Ralph because he wanted to sit at the head of the table, and Alice and Jen because all they cared about was sitting together.</p><p>Rio managed to keep her end of the shared conversation up, managed to not let the side down or Alice down.</p><p>The food was plentiful and <em>good</em>. Agatha, despite her minor injury, had made a puy lentil dish with roasted chicken thighs and Rio wondered if there was anything she wasn’t good at because she was three for three right now.</p><p>Acting, cooking, fucking.</p><p>But when it was time for more wine to be poured and dessert to be offered Rio felt a hand against her thigh and she had been so focused on watching Ralph stand after cracking a stupid joke about doing the hardest job at the table “keeping the glasses filled” that she jumped in her seat and whacked her knee against the underside of the table.</p><p>Everyone turned to look at her and even Ralph’s smile faded as he eyed Rio curiously.</p><p>“What the fuck, Vidal?” Jen asked with a scowl as Rio blushed furiously and cleared her throat, aware of the dangerous territory she’d just placed herself and Agatha in.</p><p>“Ever get one of those weird shivers?” She asked, pulling it straight out of her ass.</p><p>“I had an old friend say they happened when someone walked over your grave.”</p><p>“Riiiight,” Jen said slowly, toying with the stem of her empty glass.</p><p>Alice just scoffed out a laugh and shook her head in amusement, but kept her gaze on Rio as she settled down a little and rubbed at her knee with a frown.</p><p>Agatha didn’t make another move again until after the final bites of key lime pie had been eaten and the bowls pushed away from the happy diners and they sat and luxuriated in their fullness for a while, now all happily talking about their plans for the next little while with filming picking up for both Rio and Agatha soon.</p><p>It happened more cautiously this time, with Agatha shifting her seat a little under the pretence of getting closer to the table.</p><p>She’d brushed her fingers along the side of Rio’s thigh as she pulled back in and Rio cleared her throat quietly as she adjusted her weight to lean forwards on her elbows, providing slightly more cover if Agatha were to try again.</p><p>She didn’t. Not until Alice said that they should probably be going.</p><p>“No, stay,” Agatha said with a frown, her hand reaching out to brush Rio’s leg again even as she kept her gaze on Alice.</p><p>“It’s not that late.”</p><p>“I know but,” Alice started but Jen finished for her: “Agatha, Alice is leaving for months in two days. No offence and this was lovely but I’d like some alone time with her if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Alice rolled her eyes at her but looked thrilled all the same.</p><p>Agatha’s hand pulled away and Rio felt like she could breathe properly again.</p><p>“I should get going too. But can I help with anything?”</p><p>Alice raised her brows at this offer but said nothing as she pushed her chair back and Jen did too.</p><p>“No, nothing.”</p><p>It was the first time Agatha had properly addressed Rio since the thumb incident earlier and Rio turned to look at her, seeing the softness return where she’d earlier assumed she’d never get to see that from Agatha again.</p><p>But she had to look away, had to keep playing her role.</p><p>So she stood with the others and they all made their way to the centre of the house, grabbing bags and keys and Rio hung back as the others said their goodbyes.</p><p>She couldn’t bring herself to be embraced by Ralph so she was quick to offer her hand, and shook it firmly even as he blinked in surprise at her.</p><p>But then she turned to Agatha and before thinking much she wrapped her arms around her and heard a soft whisper in her ear: “Get home safe.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only smile falsely as she turned away for fear she’d ask to stay.</p><p>And when she hit the cooler air of the late night with Jen and Alice in tow she sucked in a heavy breath, and tried to calm her traitorous heart as it screamed at her to turn around and take one last look at Agatha Harkness.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio woke with a headache.</p><p>One she knew wasn’t due to the amount of wine she’d had the night before.</p><p>One she knew was everything to do with heartache.</p><p>Falling for a married woman was never going to be a good idea.</p><p>Falling for Agatha Harkness was always going to be the <em>worst</em> idea.</p><p>She flung her arm out from the safety of the covers and found her phone on the side. It was 9:30am, just late enough to be considered a lie in, just early enough for Rio to want to turn over and stay in bed.</p><p>But this was her final day before she had to fly to Toronto tomorrow. And with a pang she realised that this time tomorrow she’d be landing soon.</p><p>Shaking the impending travel day with Alice barking orders in her ear and inevitably questioning her on the Agatha situation, she forced herself to get up and take a shower.</p><p>The water helped. The heat helped.</p><p>She stepped from it reluctantly, deciding a huge water bill wasn’t something she wanted to add to her troubles.</p><p>Her mind was on the chores she had to do today because as mindless and dull as they were, they at least took up the space sorrowful blue eyes and tentative touches were currently taking.</p><p>But there was a noise.</p><p>A loud noise that sounded like her front door opening.</p><p>Alice.</p><p>She groaned and grabbed a towel from the side, snaking it around herself and tucking it in tightly above her left breast.</p><p>She brushed her wet hair back with a ridiculous brush that her hair stylist had once gifted her and promised it would help to keep her locks ‘shiny and sleek’. She wasn’t sure what that meant or how a brush could manage it but she liked the guy so now had incorporated the brush into her daily routine.</p><p>It was as she placed the brush down that she heard her bedroom door open and promptly close.</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>And then, there was silence.</p><p>Alice was never silent.</p><p>Instinctively, her fingers curled around the brush again and she remained still, listening intently for any sign that Alice was simply speaking to her but quietly, which in itself would be unusual.</p><p>Deciding she had to face the music whether it was a man in a balaclava or her annoyed best friend, she ripped the door open and came face to face with someone she wasn’t expecting.</p><p>The expensive magic brush slipped from her fingers and she gaped at the sight before her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was standing just a foot from the bathroom door, looking a little surprised herself that she were there.</p><p>And Rio thought her heart would never recover from the shock.</p><p>Not to mention the cruel way Agatha had decided to dress for the occasion.</p><p>She stood, brazen and bold, in a matching lilac gym set: a sports bra and leggings. Her hair was loose about her shoulders and she carried a light tote bag over her shoulder.</p><p>“You leave your front door unlocked?”</p><p>Rio blinked, her eyes darting up from where they’d been admiring the sight of toned thighs beneath the stretchy fabric of Agatha’s leggings.</p><p>“I locked it.”</p><p>“Clearly not.”</p><p>“You took it as an invitation to just… walk in?”</p><p>“I knocked,” Agatha said as if that were any excuse for walking into someone’s home.</p><p>Rio had so many questions, had so many things she needed to say, that being so full with words she found herself unable to say any of them.</p><p>It felt like her brain had short circuited. That one of her many fantasies she’d had about Agatha Harkness being in her bedroom had accidentally spilled into real life.</p><p>“I wanted to see you before you left,” Agatha offered as if she’d plucked one of the questions from Rio’s swirling brain and decided to answer it.</p><p>Rio’s mouth was open and she closed it quickly, aware she looked a little dumb standing silently with dripping hair and in a damp towel.</p><p>“How did you find out where I lived?”</p><p>Not the most important question, but one she was able to form.</p><p>Agatha’s brow quirked, as if she too knew this wasn’t exactly the question Rio wanted to ask.</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>Rio nodded just once and swallowed, feeling a blush creep up her cheeks as her eyes dropped to the abs on display before her.</p><p>“Are you going for a workout?”</p><p>“Pilates. At ten.”</p><p>And Rio nodded again, forcing herself to look at the floor to try and sort her scrambled brain. But all she could think about was how lucky the rest of Agatha’s Pilates class were to see her dressed like this, bending and stretching and holding. It made her want to die.</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, and Rio’s eyes darted to the bag that she dropped by her feet as she did.</p><p>“I wanted to talk to you,” Agatha said, quieter this time.</p><p>“I think you said everything you wanted to yesterday.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and raised her gaze to Agatha again, seeing a brief flicker of fear in blue eyes before it disappeared and she instead looked soft again.</p><p>Much softer than she’d looked when she was telling Rio it was over. That it had been a mistake.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer and Rio sucked in a breath, moving so her back was against the frame of the bathroom door and her chin raised to challenge Agatha.</p><p>But she didn’t back down.</p><p>She stepped in and placed a hand on Rio’s cheek, her fingers just grazing the wet hair on the side of her head and her thumb tracing over still damp skin.</p><p>Rio felt the fire ignite in her again. She felt the pull of Agatha tighten its silky promise around her heart and she leant into her touch without meaning to, even as her mind caught up and said the lie she’d been telling herself since entering Agatha’s home yesterday evening:</p><p>“You were right yesterday. It was a mistake.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, even as her free hand moved up to hold Rio’s face properly, her touch so warm and welcome that Rio almost melted into her.</p><p>Her hands betrayed her and moved so her fingers could rest gently at Agatha’s hips and she sucked in a soft breath at the feel of her skin above the waistband of her leggings.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted and Rio’s gaze fell to them, wondering if she’d ever see lips so perfect again, so beautifully crafted and so soft to the touch.</p><p>“A mistake I won’t make with anyone else. And a mistake I’d like to make properly, with you.”</p><p>Rio was shaken from her reverie, pulled back into her body as she raised her gaze to Agatha’s blue eyes, seeing an earnestness there that for now, at least, was all she needed to incline her head ever so slightly.</p><p>Even in her petulant mood the night before, she wouldn’t have denied Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha gave her a second’s grace in case she changed her mind. But her lips were now parted and blue eyes were now on Rio’s lips.</p><p>Rio breathed in slowly as Agatha closed the distance between them.</p><p>It was different this time, kissing Agatha.</p><p>It wasn’t new or frightening. Or rushed and soft. It was needy and desperate.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved to hold Rio’s head and Rio’s wrapped firmly around Agatha’s hips to press them flush together.</p><p>And Rio moaned unwittingly when she tasted Agatha’s tongue again for the first time since their dalliance on the couch.</p><p>But she didn’t have to be quiet anymore.</p><p>And Agatha clearly didn’t want her to be if the press of her hips or the nails digging into her scalp were anything to go by.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved down to grip Agatha’s ass at the same time that Agatha introduced her teeth to Rio’s lips and bit down harshly and Rio moaned as she opened her eyes to see Agatha looking at her with eyes the colour of midnight.</p><p>“Fuck,” she mumbled as Agatha released her lip and went to soothe it with the tip of her tongue.</p><p>It made Rio tremble and Agatha moved her damp hands down her jaw, trailing her throat and then her chest until her fingers dipped into her towel and she tugged it down.</p><p>The white fabric pooled between them, gathering where their hips still met and exposing just Rio’s torso.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath when Agatha’s hands fell to her breasts and she watched as Agatha watched her react to every light touch of her fingers there.</p><p>“Get on the bed,” she said softly, and Rio had to fight the whimper that threatened to escape her swollen lips as Agatha pulled back, her fingers still on her breasts until the very last second where she broke Rio’s hold on her and let the towel fall to the floor between them.</p><p>Rio only nodded, allowing for a second Agatha’s gaze to take in her naked form before she took her hand and pulled her to the unmade bed with her.</p><p>She sat on the edge and pulled Agatha between her open legs, tugging her until her knees were knocking the mattress and Rio was just inches from her abdomen.</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and instead dropped Rio’s hand to cross her arms over herself and lift her sports bra from her body.</p><p>She threw it behind her and Rio’s mouth fell open at the sight before her.</p><p>She reacted immediately, her hands flying to Agatha’s waist as she leant up, seeking the taste of Agatha’s perfect breasts in her hungry mouth.</p><p>But as her lips brushed the soft skin across Agatha’s ribs she made a soft noise of complaint and pushed Rio away, applying enough pressure to her shoulders to get her to lie down.</p><p>“Agatha,” she protested with a frown, leaning up on her elbows to watch as Agatha stepped back a little and began to slip out of her tight leggings.</p><p>“Move back. Lay down properly.”</p><p>Unable to understand let alone fulfil the instructions now Agatha was standing proudly, gloriously naked before her, Rio simply stayed still, free eyes roaming all over the exposed body of the woman she’d crawl over hot coals for.</p><p>“Fuck me,” she muttered softly, barely able to keep it together when Agatha stepped closer and placed her hands back on Rio’s face.</p><p>“Lay down, Rio. I want to taste you.”</p><p>The whimper Rio had held in before now escaped her lips and Agatha smiled because of it, her the thumb of her left hand moving down to brush across Rio’s lower lip.</p><p>“Move,” she said softly, still gazing at Rio’s mouth as it opened for her and she pressed the tip of her thumb in to meet Rio’s curious tongue.</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>Rio had to fight the urge to not comply. She had to force herself to pull away, to put distance between them when she wanted Agatha all over her, immediately, forever.</p><p>But she pushed herself back, choosing to turn and crawl rather than shuffle, and she lay her head against her pillow, watching Agatha copy her movements as she crawled onto the bed, and over her body.</p><p>Agatha hovered above her and Rio fought the shiver that threatened to give away her desperation. Her hands raised to Agatha’s waist again and she felt goosebumps rise there where she trailed her fingers along the soft ridges of her ribs.</p><p>But she couldn’t look away from the blue eyes of the woman above her. Agatha’s hair created a curtain between them and the outside world and Rio felt suddenly shy from the intimacy of the position they were in.</p><p>They were barley touching, but she could feel the heat from Agatha’s body all over her. She could feel the soft breaths of the older woman against her parted lips. She could see the same shyness suddenly reflected back at her in eyes so dark she could lose herself in them.</p><p>Agatha ducked her head down and unlike the intensity of the kiss before, she nudged their noses lightly, making Rio’s heart hammer from something other than desire.</p><p>“You’re perfect,” Agatha whispered quietly against Rio’s lips, capturing the words between them as she kissed Rio slowly, softly, only pressing her tongue into Rio’s mouth with a tender movement as her left hand moved to cup Rio’s breast.</p><p>Rio moaned, arching up a little into the hold as she struggled to keep a grasp on her desire to have more of Agatha.</p><p>She tugged at her upper body, wanting Agatha to press against her, and when she did, when her hand moved away and their breasts met for the first time Rio wondered how she’d spend the rest of her life unable to feel like this again.</p><p>Agatha was now flush against her, and she wrapped her legs around her hips to trap her there.</p><p>But Agatha was groaning quietly, moving away already, shifting her weight and breaking Rio’s hold.</p><p>Her tenderness had disappeared as she became hungry once more and hot lips and teeth and tongue were exploring the trail down to Rio’s breasts.</p><p>Agatha replaced her hand back on one and her mouth on the other and Rio no longer had to guess whether Agatha was going to be shy.</p><p>She wrapped her whole mouth over Rio’s right breast and sucked hard as Rio arched into her and moaned out.</p><p>Agatha slipped her free arm beneath her back and held her in place as she sucked and teased and licked her breast.</p><p>Her left hand groped until she swapped, paying Rio’s other breast an equal amount of attention and making Rio feel more desperate than she ever had in her life.</p><p>“Agatha,” she groaned quietly, her back arched up impossibly and her hands now scratching at Agatha’s back.</p><p>And Agatha pulled away with a soft <em>pop</em> as she released Rio’s nipple, her hand still squeezing over Rio’s other breast as she looked up at her.</p><p>Rio knew this angle wouldn’t be good, knew she’d look desperate and wild, but she had to look down at Agatha and see her lying over her like that, her eyes dark and lips swollen.</p><p>The sight took her breath away.</p><p>Agatha was panting softly, her fingers still curled over Rio’s breast, her lips just inches above her sternum.</p><p>And she was looking at Rio so openly, so expectantly, as if she’d been doing this for years and had never really thought it were unusual or new and Rio’s wide-eyed gaze was reminding her that this was new for both of them.</p><p>Rio’s fingers began swirling a softer pattern between Agatha’s shoulder blades and she licked her lips as Agatha returned her attention to her body, pressing soft and slow kisses until just above her belly button where she stopped and held Rio’s hips firmly.</p><p>Rio swallowed and raised up to her elbows and the shift made Agatha look up again.</p><p>“You don’t have to,” she said quietly, her brow furrowing where she realised what Agatha was about to do and that in her haste she’d not stopped to think logically.</p><p>Because Rio was the first woman Agatha had been with. And Rio wanted to make sure she felt safe and comfortable because clearly Ralph wasn’t the kind of man to do that for his wife.</p><p>So Rio would step up and provide it.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she added, “I mean if you don’t want to it’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha had dropped her gaze and pressed her lips back against Rio’s stomach, holding there for a second before she pulled back to whisper, “It’s all I want.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and could only watch as Agatha moved slowly down, her face close to her body but no longer making contact.</p><p>And then she was settling properly between her legs, her hands still at Rio’s hips, her gaze down before her and Rio had to fight off another whimper.</p><p>She’d parted her legs a little more so Agatha could lay between them comfortably; feeling more exposed and suddenly shy at being so on display for the goddess between her thighs.</p><p>Agatha moved her hands slowly down to her thighs and pushed them to get Rio to stretch them further, and Rio bit her lip where she looked down at Agatha, seeing her take the sight before her in.</p><p>Agatha’s thumb grazing her inner thigh was the only warning she got before she felt her warmth breath against her.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath so audible that Agatha’s eyes flickered up to her as her tongue came into contact with her pussy for the first time.</p><p>Rio almost came on the spot.</p><p>Agatha had moaned as just the tip of her tongue slipped through Rio’s soaked folds and Rio saw stars as the anticipation of what it would feel like to have Agatha eating her out properly hit home.</p><p>But Agatha had pulled back again and her gaze had dropped from Rio’s and Rio wanted to lift her hips, wanted to encourage Agatha to do more, to go faster.</p><p>But she held steady, for fear if she pushed Agatha would pull away.</p><p>But Agatha was adjusting, calculating, working out how best to do what she needed so desperately to do.</p><p>And Rio was compliant as she lifted her thighs to help Agatha wrap her arms underneath them.</p><p>She was still and silent when Agatha kissed along her sensitive skin on her inner right thigh, and she even controlled her volume when she felt Agatha’s breath against her core once more.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her tightened and her tongue this time wasn’t as tame in its exploration.</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha closed her eyes and pressed herself fully against her and Rio whined as Agatha began to eat her out, slowly but greedily.</p><p>She explored her with confident strokes, tasted every inch of her and swirled her tongue until Rio’s moans were so frequent that she developed a rhythm that was so expertly enacted that Rio almost came from just Agatha’s explorations.</p><p>But a movement lower down, Agatha’s tongue seeking her entrance and the angle made Agatha’s nose press in and brush Rio’s clit and Rio bucked her hips without warning.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot open and she looked up at Rio, pausing her movements until Rio’s breathing evened out a little and she pulled her tongue back up slowly, curiously watching Rio’s reaction.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio pleaded gently, until her plea was replaced by a low groan when Agatha found her clit again with her tongue and pressed her lips around it to suck.</p><p>Rio fell from her elbows and clutched at the sheets as Agatha applied enough pressure to drive her to the edges of sanity.</p><p>Agatha continued her assault against her clit, using Rio’s twitches and moans to find her rhythm, to determine whether her lips or tongue would help her achieve her goal and soon Rio came with a cry of Agatha’s name and her hips rocking up into a waiting mouth.</p><p>Agatha pulled away only to catch her breath, only to shift her arm so she could rest her hand on Rio’s abdomen, only so she could stare down at the meal she’d just made of Rio’s pussy.</p><p>Rio couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Even with eyes open she couldn’t see.</p><p>But then, she felt Agatha’s fingers against her and she whimpered as she forced herself up to look down at Agatha.</p><p>Blue eyes raised to hers and Rio moaned quietly at the vision before her.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been shy in her exploring. She hadn’t worried about being delicate or neat. And evidence of that was all over her face.</p><p>Agatha seemed to understand why Rio was staring the way she was and her tongue darted out to lick her lips as she pressed her fingers down and inside of her, making Rio groan quietly as she kept eye contact with Agatha.</p><p>She felt more confident that Agatha wouldn’t pull away now and she forced her legs open a little more, watching as midnight blue eyes fell between them again and she felt Agatha curl her fingers inside her.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered quietly, her hips rocking with every slow thrust until Agatha returned her lips to her cunt, pressing a slow openmouthed kiss to her swollen clit.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t just a virtuoso. She was a revelation.</p><p>Rio had been with countless women. All shapes and sizes and personalities and experience levels.</p><p>And yet none of them turned her on this much.</p><p>None of them made her feel so delirious she felt high with it.</p><p>None of them made her moan so frequently or as effortlessly as Agatha did.</p><p>She came in no time at all, so worked up and sensitive with Agatha’s mouth against her and fingers buried deep inside of her.</p><p>Only when able to come back to herself did she push Agatha away, looking down to see Agatha still urgently trying for more.</p><p>“Agatha, Agatha. Stop, stop.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away properly, her fingers stilling inside of her before they slowly pulled out.</p><p>“I’m not done.”</p><p>A slow grin crept up Rio’s face that transformed into a laugh and she reached her hands down from Agatha’s head to cup her jaw, “Come here.”</p><p>“I said I wasn’t done,” Agatha insisted, a husk in her voice that wasn’t there before.</p><p>And Rio wanted to give in. She could have selfishly kept Agatha between her thighs for decades and never been sick of it but she had another desire that overrode that one. She wanted to feel what eating her out had done to Agatha.</p><p>“Come here,” she said again, stronger this time as she applied pressure to Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin and remained still for a second before she began to slowly move back along Rio’s body, pressing damp kisses between her breasts until she was hovering over her again.</p><p>Rio grinned where Agatha frowned.</p><p>“Kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha eyed Rio for a second before she closed the gap between them and Rio tasted herself on Agatha’s tongue for the first time.</p><p>It was a euphoria like no other.</p><p>A miraculous thing that made her hungry again and she pressed up and into Agatha as she reached down between them to find what she needed to desperately know.</p><p>She hit Agatha’s inner thighs first and found them slick with her desire, trailing her fingers teasingly higher until she could cup Agatha’s pussy and feel the mess she’d already made.</p><p>“No, no,” she groaned softly as she pulled away, nudging Agatha’s face from her own as she pulled her hand back and began to wrestle them over.</p><p>“I need you to come against my mouth. I need to taste you.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to protest but Rio had already flipped them, was already making quick work of scrambling down Agatha’s body to slip between her legs.</p><p>She sucked in a breath at the musky, heavenly scent of Agatha before she felt hands on her head, firm and heavy and Agatha’s voice, louder, firmer, no longer as husky or needy.</p><p>“Wait, Rio. I’m not-…”</p><p>The wind was knocked out of Rio’s sails and she relented beneath her still firm hold, pulling back so Agatha wouldn’t have to worry and she raised slowly to her knees, pulling away to give Agatha the space she clearly needed.</p><p>“I’ve had a baby, Rio.”</p><p>Rio blinked because whatever she was expecting Agatha to say, it wasn’t that.</p><p>But Agatha was raising to her elbows now, her whole face twisting into something that looked a lot to Rio like shame.</p><p>And it didn’t sit well with her. Not at all.</p><p>And so Rio crawled back up Agatha’s body and knocked her elbows out so she would lay flat and Rio could bracket her head with her forearms.</p><p>“You,” she said quietly, confidently, slowly lowering herself on top of Agatha.</p><p>“Are,” she said with a small smile as she took Agatha’s arms wrapping around her waist to be a good sign that she wasn’t pulling away entirely.</p><p>“The hottest,” she pressed a small kiss to the tip of Agatha’s nose.</p><p>“Most breathtaking woman, I have ever seen.”</p><p>She pressed a kiss to her lips that Agatha returned.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Agatha said quietly, her frown still marring her features, “I look different.”</p><p>“You look <em>incredible</em>. And if you’ll let me I’d really like to see how incredible you taste.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips but her arms went slack around Rio and Rio took this as an ‘okay’.</p><p>She pulled back and went slower this time, tempering her own desire so that Agatha knew she was more into her than she could even say.</p><p>She kissed every inch of Agatha’s body until Agatha was squirming beneath her with want.</p><p>“Rio,” she husked out and Rio grinned against Agatha’s hip bone, pleased her blip of fear was just that: a blip.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Will you just goddamn get to it.”</p><p>“Get to what?”</p><p>Rio kissed her again.</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Rio looked up just in time to see Agatha raising to her elbows, a pretty flush against her cheeks and all fear gone from her gaze as she glared down at Rio’s shit-eating grin.</p><p>“Eat me out or so help me god…”</p><p>Rio could only continue grinning, and she turned back down to kiss a slow trail to the little patch of hairs at the apex of Agatha’s pussy.</p><p>She hummed from low in her chest, raising her gaze to see Agatha staring down at her, her chest already heaving and her pupils blown as she watched Rio dip her mouth down and slide her tongue in to brush alongside her clit.</p><p>Rio moaned alongside Agatha at the taste of her.</p><p>Heady and somehow sweet, she knew instantly that she’d have to be pried away from her to ever be able to stop.</p><p>Agatha was already on her back again and Rio was unsurprised when her hips began to rock down against her as she ate her out feverishly, each stroke of her tongue making her desperate for more.</p><p>But Agatha took her by surprise when she came against her with a scream, her hips bucking harshly into Rio’s willing face as Rio’s tongue fought to keep contact with her clit.</p><p>Two things Rio now knew for sure about Agatha Harkness: she came quickly, and she came loudly.</p><p>She’d known the first already but the second would have been impossible to know given the last time she’d made her come a sleeping child had been just upstairs.</p><p>But Rio didn’t pull away to let Agatha come down or to take a breath.</p><p>She simply continued her explorations, dipping lower to allow Agatha’s rocking hips to ride her tongue.</p><p>She used every trick she knew and soon found herself reaching down between her own thighs just for some sort of release.</p><p>But Agatha came again before Rio could relieve some of the building tension for herself and she focused on letting Agatha rock against her as she moaned and twitched on the bed.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. Fuck. I-…”</p><p>Rio grinned as she slowly pulled away, lifting the hand she’d just had inside herself to press a finger slowly inside Agatha and causing her to groan quietly.</p><p>“We need to build you up,” Rio said, half mumbling now against Agatha’s inner thigh, “You’re so sensitive.”</p><p>Agatha only moaned quietly, huffing out a breath of frustration when Rio pulled out of her.</p><p>“Are you telling me,” Agatha began, still catching her breath as Rio began to kiss her way back up to her lips, “that you’re not incredibly smug that I come so quickly for you.”</p><p>Rio grinned and even Agatha smiled a little as she gazed up at her, “Maybe I am. Sue me.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and began to trail her fingers slowly up and down Rio’s sides.</p><p>“You’re so incredibly irritating.”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant in to kiss Agatha, nipping gently at her lower lip, “You don’t mean that.”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>Rio hummed and kissed her again, “Maybe if I go down on you again you’ll change your mind.”</p><p>She made to move but Agatha held her firmly, “Actually, I was hoping you’d sit on my face.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and moved a hand to Agatha’s cheek, watching her in silence for a second, her eyes darting to the lips that turned to kiss at her palm.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Stop treating me like I don’t know what I want.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded silently, her gaze dropping absently to Agatha’s swollen lips.</p><p>But Agatha was keener than she realised and she was now clutching at her, clawing at her back to make her move, reaching down to grab her ass and heave her up the bed.</p><p>And Rio obliged. She shuffled up and waited for Agatha to nod up at her slightly until she placed her knees either side of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha chastised, her arms curling around Rio’s thighs, “Sit.”</p><p>Rio felt her stomach flip at the instruction and she lowered herself at Agatha’s pace as she pulled her down against her.</p><p>Rio’s breath was taken away by the eagerness of Agatha’s mouth against her again.</p><p>And this time she was unable to stop herself from rocking against her, grinding in a slow rhythm as Agatha moaned beneath her.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and found herself suddenly desperate to hear Agatha’s louder moans again, to feel them against her core.</p><p>She moved cautiously to hold her own weight, worried about crushing Agatha as she did.</p><p>But she adjusted herself and leant back to press her fingers against Agatha’s pussy, scissoring around her clit as she felt the first of Agatha’s true moans vibrate through her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed at the sound and the feel of Agatha practically vibrating beneath her and she had to focus hard to keep herself steady and her hand working Agatha up as quickly as she possibly could.</p><p>She’d been right to guess that it wouldn’t take long.</p><p>And Agatha came against her hand so violently that if it weren’t for Agatha’s firm hold around her thighs Rio might have fallen right off.</p><p>Rio kept her fingers teasing Agatha, enjoying the small jolts of her hips against her that matched the pressure of her tongue against her own clit and not long after Agatha had come, Rio was tipped over the edge, her attention long gone as she pulled forwards and ground down against Agatha’s needy mouth.</p><p>Agatha held her against her, trapping her so harshly that she couldn’t help but rock into her more but she was getting sensitive and had to scramble her hands to Agatha’s on her inner thighs to get her to relent.</p><p>She groaned as she did and reluctantly pulled away and swung her leg over to collapse onto her stomach beside Agatha.</p><p>She groaned quietly as she stretched her arms above her head and soon felt Agatha move up her body, kissing every inch of her thigh and biting down on her ass until she was making her way along her back and burying her nose into the hollow behind Rio’s ear, resting her body half on top of her.</p><p>“Come back,” she whispered quietly against her, “I want to do it again.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and turned her head against the mattress to grin at Agatha who looked serious suddenly, her gaze sweeping across Rio’s face as she leant off to the side.</p><p>“I don’t have much time and-…”</p><p>Rio placed her fingers gently over Agatha’s lips, resting the pads there and smiling a little at the sight.</p><p>“You gotta give me a minute. And we should talk about this.”</p><p>She turned over fully then and found that before she could make the move to, Agatha had already pressed against her and wrapped her arm around her waist.</p><p>“I’ll have to leave soon,” Agatha said more gently this time and Rio nodded, coming down quicker from her high now as her smile faded away and her eyes swept over the majesty of Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I wish I could take a picture of you right now.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and moved her hand up to Rio’s cheek, watching her with a soft curiosity.</p><p>“Something to remember me by?”</p><p>Rio hummed a little, trying to pretend it didn’t hurt.</p><p>“I’ll never forget the way you look right now.”</p><p>“Don’t say things like that,” Agatha said, leaning in to brush their lips together.</p><p>“I can’t help it.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha whispered, kissing Rio a little more firmly this time.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and closed her eyes, unable to look at the face she’d no longer get to see up this close anymore.</p><p>“You lied about Chicago. By the pool. In Italy. You lied.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s soft breaths against her lips, but didn’t say anything and it was Agatha who filled the silence.</p><p>“I saw you that night and I wanted you. More than I’d wanted anyone before. And I thought maybe if I got you alone… and then I saw you go to the bathroom and you were drunk and cute and you told me you’d buy me a ring and-…”</p><p>“A ring?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open slowly and she frowned at Agatha, focusing briefly on her nose and seeing four tiny freckles in a vertical row along it, wondering if she’d ever be close enough to count them again.</p><p>“You told me you’d buy me a bigger ring than Ralph had. So I thought maybe you wouldn’t mind if I kissed you. And I asked and then… we were interrupted.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and was struck by the memory she’d never had because she’d been too liberal with the tequila in mourning a woman she’d never even had, before she would eventually be allowed her so fleetingly.</p><p>“You didn’t ever come back. You didn’t ever seek me out again. Even at awards shows.”</p><p>“I’m married. It was a lapse in judgment,” Agatha said in an even softer tone, but the words still stung all the same as Rio closed her eyes once more and fought the bile that rose in her throat.</p><p>“No tienes que estar casada, Agatha.” <em>You don’t have to be married, Agatha.</em></p><p>There was safety in saying the words in Spanish. They felt softer, a truth rather than a reminder.</p><p>But she didn’t open her eyes to see Agatha’s frown, her reluctance to speak even as her mouth opened to do so.</p><p>They were both silent for a while, Agatha’s breathing still soft against Rio’s lips, their noses occasionally nudging where Agatha must be pressing a little closer every few seconds.</p><p>“Y’know I’ve never come before.”</p><p>Rio blinked her eyes open and frowned across at Agatha, as if seeing her for the first time.</p><p>Agatha looked softer now, innocent even, even when she still had the evidence of Rio all over her face.</p><p>“I mean,” she began to clarify, “Not with another person.”</p><p>“I…” Rio started and then stopped herself, unsure how to even broach this topic without wanting to vomit. “Ralph doesn’t… he’s not good with his hands? His tongue? Does he have a tiny dick?”</p><p>Rio bet he did.</p><p>“No, I…” Agatha sighed and shook her head as she moved her fingers back to begin toying with Rio’s still damp hair.</p><p>“I mean he doesn’t use them. His fingers only to, y’know, push a little before he just…”</p><p>She trailed off and Rio pulled away, her incredulity taking over her rational mind for a second. And Agatha sat with her, watching her carefully as Rio stared off into the distance and tried to fathom a world where the person allowed to touch Agatha wouldn’t be spending every moment of their time together just worshipping her.</p><p>“He doesn’t even <em>try</em>?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat quietly, “I’m only telling you as, I don’t know, consider it a parting gift.”</p><p>Rio snapped her head around to Agatha then and stared at her without really seeing, “Do you think it makes me feel good that you’re in a loveless marriage with a guy who can’t make you come?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, and then dropped her gaze from Rio entirely, her expression suddenly tense, her brow furrowed and her lips briefly pursing.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio snapped sharply, unable to bear this new piece of information. Torn between horror and the dullest, smallest part of her that wanted to confirm Agatha’s assumption: that she was pleased that financier fucker didn’t make his wife come.</p><p>“You can’t spend-…”</p><p>She stopped herself, seeing Agatha’s eyes flash up to her own suddenly and knowing that she were about to push them down a dangerous route; a route where Rio would <em>ask</em> Agatha to leave Ralph and Agatha would say ‘no’.</p><p>So she moved slowly, giving Agatha the opportunity to stop her. But she didn’t. She instead reached her arms out to wrap around Rio’s waist as she straddled her and blinked up at her as Rio slipped her hand between them.</p><p>“Next time you’re with him,” she felt the bile rise in her throat once more, thick and threatening.</p><p>“I want you,” she pressed her thumb firmly over Agatha’s clit and made her moan softly.</p><p>“To tell him,” she twisted her hand and teased with her fingers, pushing two easily into Agatha.</p><p>“Exactly,” she curled her fingers inwards and started moving her thumb in slow circles.</p><p>“Where you like to be touched.” She kissed along Agatha’s jaw slowly until her lips were against her ear and she whispered:</p><p>“Close your eyes and it could be anyone.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back then, her hand moving to hold Rio’s wrist and Rio looked down at her in surprise as two things happened simultaneously:</p><p>Agatha said, “I don’t want it to be anyone.”</p><p>The front door opened.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on Rio’s wrist tightened and her soft expression transmogrified. It became panicked, stricken.</p><p>“I locked it,” she uttered breathlessly.</p><p>“Alice, she has keys,” Rio said urgently, already pulling away and hurrying to grab a discarded sweater and shorts from the chair in the corner of the room.</p><p>“Stay here,” she whispered as she pulled her shorts up her legs. “I’ll take her out back. Give me five minutes then leave. She won’t see you. You’ll be safe, I promise.”</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio glanced at the door and then looked to Agatha who was frozen to the spot, all colour drained from her previously flushed face.</p><p>Rio moved quickly to her and kissed her cheek before she ran to the bathroom to splash cold water on her face and then ran from the room, not daring to waste another second in glancing back at Agatha before she made her way to Alice.</p><p>Mercifully, her best friend was waiting for her in the kitchen.</p><p>“Did you just wake up?”</p><p>Rio scoffed, trying to subtly catch her breath as she moved past Alice without looking at her directly to grab a bottle of water from the fridge.</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes from behind her, “I want to talk to you about Agatha.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Rio said absently, chugging down some water before simply striding past and out the double doors to try and steer Alice to the garden where she’d not be able to see an escaping Agatha.</p><p>Thankfully, she followed.</p><p>Rio could barely think straight as she took Alice to a bench beneath a tree in the very back of the small space and ran a hand through her hair as Alice sat beside her.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Well,” Alice started slowly, shifting in her seat to face Rio properly, “You went from being best friends to nipping at each other to putting a bandaid on her to barely talking or looking at each other all night.”</p><p>Alice sighed quietly and then said, “Rio, did you try it on with her?”</p><p>And Rio couldn’t believe how close Alice was to the actual truth of it.</p><p>“No, no, I didn’t.”</p><p>Alice sighed again and turned back to stare at the pool that was barely a pool, especially compared to Agatha’s.</p><p>“She’s hot and she’s charismatic but-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio insisted, getting a little agitated that her best friend was warning her off the woman she’d just been riding.</p><p>“I get it. Agatha Harkness is off limits. Understood.”</p><p>Rio shot her friend a furtive glance and saw she was looking at her with a small smile, “Okay. Other than the initial thing with Ralph and Agatha being a little quiet it went well, though?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said much softer now, “It went well.”</p><p>Alice’s shoulders relaxed then and she ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>“I’ve said to Jen we can split the trips between. So I’m not missing out much time with you and her with Agatha.”</p><p>“That’s great.”</p><p>“Maybe it’ll just be the weekends, or any days off. The filming schedule keeps changing so I’m not sure when I’ll be heading down initially but I’ll always check in with you first, okay?”</p><p>“Okay. I know. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You’re distracted. What’s-…?”</p><p>But then a noise made Alice look back to the house and she stood quickly, “What was that?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said quickly, a sharp hit of panic flooding her veins, “probably just the wind.”</p><p>Alice remained standing and Rio thought she’d give up but she strode on through to the house and Rio hurried to catch up, knowing if she made too much of a fuss Alice would cotton on anyway.</p><p>“Alice, where are you going?”</p><p>“It sounded like the-…”</p><p>And Alice stopped as she hit the hallway, looking suspiciously at the front door and the keys that swayed slightly, suggesting it had just moved.</p><p>“It’s windy out. Santana, y’know. Does weird things,” Rio said as calmly as she could, grabbing Alice’s hand and tugging her back with her.</p><p>“I seriously think you need to reconsider security,” Alice was saying as Rio breathed out slowly and pulled Alice back round to the outside bench.</p><p>“I don’t need it.”</p><p>“You’re getting more famous. It’s time we considered it. Nutjobs everywhere.”</p><p>And so Rio managed to keep up appearances with Alice for another hour out on the bench, allowing her to go over their schedule for tomorrow and the plan once they landed.</p><p>She even managed to respond to every question, confirm she’d learnt at least half the script by heart, and was ready to start fresh on Monday morning.</p><p>By the time Alice left after making Rio promise she’d pack everything that night, Rio felt exhausted.</p><p>Physically from the morning’s activities and mentally from the strain of having Agatha for such a fleeting amount of time, having to release her, and having to help her hide.</p><p>She threw herself into her packing, deciding she couldn’t sleep in the soiled sheets and allowing only herself one indulgence of pressing her face into the pillow where Agatha had laid her head.</p><p>But she knew she had to move on. Get on. Get over.</p><p>It took until the late evening for the final straw in her bad afternoon and Rio found herself sat in a pile of folded clothes and two open suitcases crying over her lost favourite shirt.</p><p>She’d spent the last hour tearing the house apart trying to find it, certain that she’d recently washed it and put it away in the second drawer of her dresser.</p><p>But she couldn’t find it anywhere.</p><p>Unwilling to give up until she saw that the clock had struck 11pm and she would feel Alice’s wrath in the morning if she slept in or was less than chirpy on their early flight, she’d simply disintegrated where she sat, sobbing for a lost shirt with little cowboys with their flying lassos on it.</p><p>And Alice wouldn’t understand because she hated the shirt.</p><p>And Alice wouldn’t understand that it wasn’t just the shirt she was crying over.</p>

<p>It turns out that a good way to get over heartbreak is to be so busy that you can barely think.</p><p>A month went by and Rio had no time at all to think about Agatha.</p><p>To think about how they’d left it.</p><p>About how unhappy Agatha was in her marriage.</p><p>About how badly she wanted to see her, talk to her, touch her.</p><p>Setlife was the same as it always was. Rio was number one on the call sheet and so had to set a precedent which meant no flirting with extras, being earlier than anyone else to the set, knowing all of her lines and marks off by heart.</p><p>Which meant that her days off were mostly spent sleeping.</p><p>She was horizontal almost every hour she could be.</p><p>And not in any fun way.</p><p>In fact, she’d not slept with anyone since Agatha. And a month of no sex was longer than Rio had ever gone before. But even if she had the time or the energy she wouldn’t be interested.</p><p>Why settle when she’d had the best?</p><p>Even Alice was worried for her.</p><p>But Rio ignored the concerns of her best friend and focused on doing a good job, and on not worrying about a woman thousands of miles away with a husband.</p><p>Which was made ever so slightly easier because Rio hadn’t heard from Agatha since that last morning spent pressed together in her bedroom.</p><p>Any spare time she had she spent making sure to call her parents. Ever since she’d been embarrassed by the care package they’d sent to Alice she was now diligent about speaking to them every week.</p><p>And in all honesty, it made her feel better. It made her feel normal.</p><p>Only one night, about six weeks into the shoot, she’d plugged her headphones into her cell to make the call and she was chatting away about something a cousin of hers had done when her attention was stolen away by something else.</p><p>“…and I just said to your tía…”</p><p>Agatha had text her.</p><p>Rio had been so distracted by the name that appeared in the modal at the top of her screen as she’d idly being scrolling Instagram - and only vaguely listening to her mother - that she’d forgotten to read the message preview.</p><p>“…he’s just always been such a good boy, un ángel…”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, only now vaguely aware that in her little house in Delaware Anna Vidal was happily chatting into her phone thinking her beloved child was paying attention.</p><p>She flicked out of Instagram and clicked into WhatsApp.</p><p>There on the Home Screen, right at the top of the list of her chats with coworkers or old friends, was Agatha’s name, the message and a little green ‘1’.</p><p>“…I have no idea how he gets away with it now…”</p><p>Rio clicked into it to expand it properly.</p><p>7:34pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I thought you’d be pleased to know that I’m taking Nicky to his first Celtics game next weekend.</p><p>Rio stared at it.</p><p>“… if you were doing anything like this dios mío…”</p><p>Agatha had reached out. Agatha was telling her her plans. Agatha was going to be much closer to Rio in just over a week.</p><p>And Rio had learnt her lesson now.</p><p>She’d first not text Agatha back for three days and regretted it.</p><p>Then she’d not text her back at all and regretted <em>that</em> even more.</p><p>“… anyway, your father was saying that he once knew…”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath as she sent her response, knowing it was risky, knowing that it could be potentially embarrassing.</p><p>7:35pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can I come?</p><p>“…that niña encantadora…”</p><p>7:36pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’ll buy you a ticket.</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt in her chest and she stared at her phone, unsure what had just happened and knowing only that next weekend she’d be seeing Agatha again.</p><p>And that Agatha wanted her there.</p><p>She <em>wanted</em> to see her.</p><p>“…mija?”</p><p>Rio was too busy staring down at Agatha’s last text that her mum had to repeat herself three times before she heard her.</p><p>“God, mom. Sorry. I’m so tired. Can I call you back tomorrow?”</p><p>There was a beat of silence and then Anna Vidal said in a softer tone, “Are you eating well? Do you need me to send anything?”</p><p>“No, mom. I love you. I’ll call tomorrow.”</p><p>“Okay, mija. I love you too.”</p><p>Rio hung up with a click of the button on the wire and went right back to staring at her phone screen.</p><p>She went through all the possible response she could think of and eventually settled on:</p><p>7:41pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: In exchange I’ll buy you a jersey.</p><p>7:42pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: What would John Smith say?</p><p>Rio grinned at her phone like she were fifteen and her crush were online.</p><p>Turns out six weeks thinking she was safe from Agatha’s gravitational pull were just a delusion.</p><p>She had her in her orbit.</p><p>She chewed on her lip and her thumbs danced over the keypad before she eventually tapped out:</p><p>7:44pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Hard to know what imaginary men might say. But the very real Agatha Harkness should thank me.</p><p>It was pushing things towards flirty perhaps, but not overstepping so much that Agatha couldn’t either shut it down or pull it right back.</p><p>7:45pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’ve booked you a suite at The Langham. Is that thanks enough?</p><p>Rio couldn’t believe it. She wanted to reach through the phone to get to Agatha.</p><p>To pull her through it and have her here with her.</p><p>But she tempered her thoughts with the reminder that this wasn’t a private trip.</p><p>That anywhere Agatha went - particularly a big basketball game - she would be photographed.</p><p>And more than that, her seven year old son would be there.</p><p>Both things meant no subtle touches, no sly hand holds, no yearning looks.</p><p>And Rio could handle it because they’d agreed: they’d made a mistake, made it now properly, and it wouldn’t happen again.</p><p>But she was fucked now.</p><p>For the rest of the week all she’d be able to think about was the fact that she’d soon be back in the presence of Agatha. Soon be able to talk to her, to see if she missed her, to see if she still wanted her.</p><p>7:52pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’ll let you know when I see you.</p><p>7:54pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Nicky’s excited already.</p><p>7:55pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Are you?</p><p>Rio put her phone down then. Ripped her headphones from her ears. Buried her face in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She’d slipped up already.</p><p>She took long slow breaths and had to remind herself that she was talking to the woman who broke into her house, who touched her leg whilst sitting just feet away from her husband, who cheated with her not once, but twice.</p><p>It would be insane for Agatha to have bought her a ticket and a hotel suite and to <em>not</em> be excited.</p><p>But the question felt exposing anyway.</p><p>It felt incredibly vulnerable to ask.</p><p>She waited until she could catch her breath again before she checked her phone.</p><p>8:01pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I don’t care for basketball.</p><p>Rio had to roll her eyes, had to huff a little at the response. Because surely Agatha knew what she’d been asking.</p><p>With Agatha’s refusal to play ball she pushed a little, because she couldn’t help it now, deciding that she could no longer run anymore. She couldn’t just lay down and let Agatha fuck her physically and emotionally.</p><p>8:03pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’m excited to see you.</p><p>Rio didn’t receive a text back after that. Not for five minutes. Not for ten. Not for twenty or even an hour.</p><p>She’d moved on, she had to. She’d gone to cleanse her face and get ready for bed.</p><p>She’d pulled her script out of her bag and was settling down for the night to force the lines into her Agatha-centric brain when the next text came through.</p><p>9:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: We’ll see you Saturday at the hotel. Reception will have my room under John Smith. I’ll let them know you’re coming so you can come find us. Have a good week. X</p><p>Rio read and reread the message.</p><p>She read it so many times she memorised it like it were one of her lines that she was yet to even partially commit to memory.</p><p>She read it in her own voice, in Agatha’s voice, in the voice she hoped Agatha would use when she said it.</p><p>She felt the whispered words on her temple, on her cheek, on her lips, she felt it against her breast, over her ribs, between her thighs.</p><p>She didn’t respond to it. Not out of habit but out of necessity. She couldn’t respond to something that she didn’t know how to.</p><p>Perhaps a ‘thank you’ or a ‘cool see you then’ would work or perhaps a ‘great I’ll be thinking about it every second until I’m with you again’.</p><p>She put her phone down on the side and returned to her script.</p><p>The words were ephemera to her. The meaning behind them lost on her as she tried to focus in.</p><p>By 11pm she gave up. Deciding a quick run through in the makeup chair with Alice would be the best bet.</p><p>Sleep eluded her too.</p><p>But by morning, as tired as she was, she felt a little more sane.</p><p>Agatha didn’t have to agree to her coming. Hell, Agatha didn’t even have to tell her they were going. Agatha could have gone with Ralph, could not have gone at all.</p><p>And yet she was taking her son, the one she said she had because of Rio, the one she said <em>looked</em> like Rio, to see Rio’s favourite team play. And she’d told Rio about it.</p><p>Made the arrangements so Rio could join them.</p><p>Perhaps have dinner with them.</p><p>It’d be like a field trip into family life. A life with Agatha.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said sharply, snapping her fingers in front of Rio’s face - an annoying habit she’d picked up from time spent with Jen - “snap out of it. You need to nail these lines.”</p><p>Rio sighed from her position in her makeup chair, earning her a gentle squeeze on the shoulder from the woman currently adjusting the curl of her front layers.</p><p>She glanced up and shared a soft smile with her before she focused back in on the script.</p><p>She had just over two hours before she was due to shoot her first scene. Which was usually more than enough time to get lines into her brain.</p><p>“Amply sufficient,” her dad would have called it.</p><p>By some miracle, the time taken was enough for her.</p><p>She managed to squeeze the lines into her full brain and by the time she was on her mark she was Rio Vidal the actress again, not Rio Vidal the lovelorn.</p><p>The day went smoothly after that, with the only interruptions being from Alice telling her about some interview she had lined up later that evening over the phone.</p><p>And soon Agatha was pushed to the back of Rio’s mind, protected under lock and key so Rio could focus on being a person again.</p><p>Someone who took charge of the set and its culture with a gentle hand and genuine enthusiasm for what they were doing.</p><p>With the weekend approaching Rio decided not to tell Alice what she was doing or where she was going. Alice was flying off to see Jen on the Friday night anyway so Rio felt no real desire to stress her out by letting her know her plans.</p><p>So she arrived in Boston with zero fanfare, a Celtics cap on her head, a light button down hiding the Celtics branded T-shirt she wore and a heavy oversized blazer that only just protected her from the chill of the October temperatures.</p><p>She was recognised by the flight attendant on the way over and the woman sitting beside her on the plane.</p><p>Both were polite. Both left her alone after whispered mentions of their being fans.</p><p>By the time Rio got to the hotel she was in a good mood, practically vibrating with the prospect of seeing Agatha, and excited even to see the littlest boy with the biggest smile.</p><p>She checked in, and found that the staff knew to expect her and so told her before she even had to ask where Agatha was.</p><p>Or John Smith, as she’d labelled herself.</p><p>The concierge took Rio to her floor, showed her to her suite, and pointed out that Agatha’s was just down the corridor from her.</p><p>Tipping the concierge generously before she was left alone, she went to drop her bag by her bed and straighten herself out in the bathroom.</p><p>She applied more lipstick, ruffled her hair slightly, and liberally sprayed more perfume on herself.</p><p>It was pointless to pretend she didn’t want to look good for Agatha.</p><p>Once satisfied that she looked good enough she went to sort her bags, finding in her suitcase the plastic bag branded with a Sports Store logo, containing the gifts she’d bought for Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>With her bag and her courage raised, she left her suite to go and knock on the door of Agatha’ suite.</p><p>The door opened not ten seconds after Rio had knocked and for the first time in over a month Rio found herself face to face with Agatha.</p><p>She looked just breathtaking. Casual. Happy.</p><p>“You came.”</p><p>“You thought I wouldn’t?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows slightly and wondered why Agatha always suspected she wouldn’t show up when she said she would.</p><p>But she had no time at all to dwell on it as gentle hands found her hips and she felt a kiss against her cheek.</p><p>“I hope you’re prepared for a <em>very</em> excited little boy.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and felt a strange kind of calm as Agatha pulled her into the room, her hand now curled around her blazer still as she shut the door behind her.</p><p>This Agatha was different to the one she’d left behind in her bedroom. She seemed relaxed and more at peace and Rio wondered if it was because she was away with Nicky or being in a new city, or maybe, just maybe she hoped it might be because Rio had asked to come along.</p><p>“I told you I was excited too.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and Rio had to resist the urge to kiss her as her hand slipped away and the sounds of another person entering the room came into Rio’s conscious.</p><p>Agatha turned and Rio looked over to see Nicky sporting her jersey and smiling where he had a chocolate bar in his hand and evidence that he’d been enjoying it smeared across his mouth.</p><p>Rio laughed at the sight and Agatha muttered, “Don’t encourage him.”</p><p>“Hey, kid,” Rio said, ignoring Agatha’s comments as she moved around to Nicky and held up her bag of goodies.</p><p>“You got some chocolate, riiiiiiight,” she raised her hand to point it out and smiled widely, “there.”</p><p>Nicky wiped at it hurriedly but Rio didn’t seem much concerned about it so neither was he. His eyes were on the bag anyway.</p><p>“So, in honour of your first game, I wanted to make sure you had the right fit.”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky said quietly, his serious expression returning as he stared at Rio.</p><p>Agatha moved over behind them and perched on the edge of the table beside where Rio had now crouched down to be more level with Nicky.</p><p>She rifled through the bag for a few seconds before she pulled out a cap that matched the one she had attached to her small cross body bag.</p><p>“Here,” she placed it carefully on Nicky’s head and smiled at the sight of it.</p><p>“Goes perfectly with your jersey.”</p><p>Nicky looked up to see the underside of the cap’s lip and Rio shot Agatha a quick glance to see she was smiling at her, and Rio felt weak for it.</p><p>But Nicky had already moved forwards to hug Rio, clumsily smashing his cap into her shoulder and just about holding his chocolate bar away so it didn’t smush into her white shirt beneath her blazer.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio said softly, to the silent thank you, squeezing the little boy gently before releasing him and watching with a laugh as he turned to his mother and proudly held his head high with his new cap.</p><p>“Gorgeous!” Agatha proclaimed with a grin, playfully grasping the lip of the cap and shaking it to make Nicky laugh.</p><p>Rio watched the two of them for a second until she reached back into the bag and produced the next gift.</p><p>“But wait, we need to make sure your mom doesn’t embarrass us.”</p><p>She held up a brand new Celtics jersey and beamed at Agatha who looked suddenly less than thrilled and rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t need to wear it.”</p><p>“You do, mama!”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned it over with a wink, “It has your name and everything.”</p><p>This seemed to soften Agatha’s resolve a little but she still eyed it suspiciously, “Why four?”</p><p>Rio shrugged and cleared her throat, standing suddenly so that she could shake off the question and hold out the jersey to Agatha.</p><p>“You have to wear it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes up at Rio but took it and held it up for herself, and Rio just knew she was playing the part of a reluctant fan when really she’d soon give in and would wear the jersey - if not for Rio, at least for Nicky.</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said suddenly and both women looked down to the little boy who was motioning to Rio with an unsubtle movement of his head.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but stood swiftly and bundled the light fabric of her gift in one hand, using the other to snake around Rio’s waist and pull her in for a hug just as her son had just done, only this time it wasn’t as clumsy.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured so close to Rio’s ear that Rio had to fight for her life not to shiver at it in front of Agatha’s little boy.</p><p>She returned the hug loosely, fearful she’d cling on.</p><p>But Agatha was already pulling away and her hand fell back down to the fabric of Rio’s blazer to hold her in place as she turned to Nicky.</p><p>“Go wash your face and we’ll leave soon, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and scampered off only to have Agatha call after him: “No running!”</p><p>Rio laughed until Agatha turned back to her and she softened suddenly, her smile still present but tempered by the expression on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I am not wearing this.”</p><p>“Why not? You don’t want to upset your precious Lakers?”</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened a little on Rio’s blazer and Rio’s smile began to grow again.</p><p>“I don’t wear sports jerseys.”</p><p>“Think it’ll damage your brand?”</p><p>“No, I-…”</p><p>“Because if you ask me, attending a game with your son and another actress with just as much chance of winning the Oscar as you but <em>not</em> joining in will look <em>much</em> worse.”</p><p>“Just as much chance?”</p><p>“You know it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and her gaze dropped briefly to Rio’s grin before she pulled away and released her hold on her blazer.</p><p>“Fine. Fine.”</p><p>And Rio almost choked on nothing as Agatha pulled her shirt over her head and stood just in a lacy black bra.</p><p>She took her time unfurling the jersey and Rio used that time to stare at her breasts, remembering how they felt in her hands, in her mouth, pressed up against her.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha pointed out, as if she weren’t going painfully slow to <em>make sure</em> Rio would.</p><p>But she was tragically covered again, only Rio couldn’t help but think she somehow looked <em>better</em> this way. The loose jersey showed off Agatha’s toned arms and Rio stared at the way it hung.</p><p>She’d never much thought about the look of a jersey before, about the way it could sit on a beautiful woman.</p><p>But suddenly she found herself practically salivating and she knew she was staring but she couldn’t help it.</p><p>And then hands were on her arms and Agatha had stepped closer, “Something on your mind?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed, her fingers twitching at her sides, desperate to reach out and touch but unwilling to give herself an inch for fear she’d take a mile.</p><p>“No. No. Just excited for the game.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away just as Nicky appeared in the room again, looking significantly less messy than he had before.</p><p>Brushing off her inappropriate lust for a married mother of one, Rio unattached her own cap from her bag and placed it on her head, receiving a shy grin from Nicky as she did so.</p><p>“Twins,” Agatha announced with a wry smile in Rio’s direction that she rolled her eyes at.</p><p>“Let’s go, it’s good to get there early so-…”</p><p>But she’d stepped towards the door and Agatha held her arm out to stop her, “I should maybe have explained first.”</p><p>Something like fear settled in Rio’s stomach and she stared with raised brows at Agatha, watching as the woman before her glanced at Nicky and then looked back to her.</p><p>“I’ve hired security,” she lowered her voice a little and Rio looked around to see Nicky now slipping his cap off to admire it as he waited by the couch.</p><p>“Just one guy and a driver. I took Nicky to a show on broadway last year and it got pretty intense.”</p><p>Rio turned slowly to look back at Agatha and nodded, understanding that whilst she were famous to some, Agatha was famous to all. And the chances of fans being subtle about seeing her out with her son were next to zero.</p><p>“Okay,” she said softly, “that’s fine.”</p><p>She frowned a little when Agatha continued to watch her and it took a second for her to clock why she was still being watched.</p><p>She glanced at Nicky to make sure he wasn’t paying attention and stepped closer, leaning in until she could feel the warmth of Agatha’s cheek just millimetres from her own. “I’ll keep it friendly. No one will see anything that-…”</p><p>“I’m not worried about that,” Agatha said quietly, turning her head a little to catch Rio’s gaze again. “I know you will. I just want to make sure you’re prepared.”</p><p>Rio frowned but nodded slowly, feeling a sense of foreboding at the way Agatha was looking at her but unsure how else she could calm her concerns.</p><p>Only Agatha was moving away again to pick up her jacket and Rio felt her excitement transform into nerves. She wouldn’t think twice about going to a game usually. Sure, there’d be paps. There’d be people trying to get her attention, get selfies, get her to send a video to their friend, but nothing she’d ever consider dangerous.</p><p>But where Rio was known, Agatha was infamous.</p><p>And Nicky, well he was just a little boy.</p><p>Rio followed the little family out of the suite, stood beside them in the elevator, answered all of Nicky’s shy questions about the team, about the best players, about the snacks his mom said he could have with as much enthusiasm as she could muster when she was thinking about what they’d be facing when they exited the hotel.</p><p>They arrived in the lobby to zero fanfare but a tall man in dark clothing approached and nodded once at Rio and Agatha and Rio felt her shoulders fall in relief.</p><p>No one would be getting past this wall of a man.</p><p>Still, she kept close to the other two as they moved through the open space. But through the revolving doors she saw a little of what Agatha had tried to warn her of.</p><p>“You’re kidding,” she uttered softly, but Agatha caught it and glanced at her, her hand tight in Nicky’s.</p><p>“I told you.”</p><p>“How do they know you’re here? They weren’t here earlier.”</p><p>“They’ll know I’m going to the game. It’s staff, usually. Anyone with eyes to see me arrive, who saw Nicky’s jersey.”</p><p>Rio scowled and swallowed down her disgust that someone would scurry to the press to tell them that a lone woman and her young son were easy pickings for press photos.</p><p>“Nicky,” she said quickly, as they were approaching the doors, “can you hold my hand?”</p><p>The boy was frowning and Rio saw that Agatha had turned to look as he took Rio’s hand and she held his left in her left, falling into step behind them so she could guard them from behind.</p><p>Agatha shot her what she thought was a grateful smile but Rio couldn’t return it, feeling her blood boil at the audacity of these men primed and ready and already snapping photos of them through the glass.</p><p>Two concierges and the hired security moved forwards first to battle out a route to the waiting SUV and Rio moved her free hand to Nicky’s shoulder to trap him safely between herself and Agatha.</p><p>“Keep your head down, Nicky. Your mom and I will be right here.”</p><p>She straightened from where she’d bent to whisper to the boy and moved when the other two did, striding forwards with her head down and her eyes on Nicky as Agatha’s name was shouted from all angles.</p><p>She heard her own too.</p><p>But she heard Nicky’s as well and she wanted to punch the throat of whichever man felt it appropriate to try and get the attention of the scared little boy behind his mother.</p><p>The barrage lasted no more than ten seconds, with the security and hotel staff able to keep the worst of it at bay and direct Agatha, Nicky, and Rio into the back of the truck.</p><p>Rio caught her breath as she watched Agatha check on her son, her blue eyes wide and full of concern as she brushed her thumbs over the boy’s cheeks and watched him until he settled against her and she tucked him under her arm.</p><p>Rio had to look away, her whole body vibrating with fury that a simple trip to a game couldn’t be normal for Agatha and her son and she found herself flinching when a gentle hand touched her arm.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look over and clenched her jaw as she stared out of the window, relieved they were driving now, that she’d have five minutes to calm down before she’d have to face it again.</p><p>“Honey.”</p><p>Rio looked then, surprised Agatha had called her that with her son present and unable to ignore for a second time the softness in Agatha’s voice.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly and caught Agatha’s gaze drop to her tight jaw.</p><p>She looked away again and turned to look out the window once more, feeling Agatha squeeze her arm before pulling away.</p><p>The three of them remained silent for the short journey, the only noises the soft movement of Nicky as he toyed idly with his mother’s buttons on her jacket.</p><p>Rio hadn’t looked back at Agatha or Nicky since Agatha had checked on her but when they pulled up to the stadium she was relieved to see that there was no hoards of paparazzi waiting for them, only crowds of fans and attendants milling around trying to direct everyone to the right entrance.</p><p>Rio turned back around then, and caught Agatha’s eye, she froze for a second, seeing Agatha so concerned and so soft with Nicky still against her that she forgot how angry she was and suddenly remembered how smitten she was instead.</p><p>But the door was being opened and Agatha turned away to step out and help Nicky.</p><p>Rio slipped out behind them and looked around when her hand was taken by the little boy and he grinned up at her. She’d forgotten in the stress of earlier how excited he was. And far be it for her to ruin his special day by being in a bad mood about some idiots with cameras.</p><p>They made it through the crowds with the security hanging back a little to give them some space.</p><p>But Rio was more aware than usual of the faces and fingers that pointed in their direction. She could feel eyes on them, could see phones being raised and knew by the time they reached the turnstiles to enter, they’d been captured on various devices at least a thousand times.</p><p>The brick wall of a man who’d protected them earlier waited outside the stadium to collect them later and Rio could only hope he’d be right there as soon as they needed him when they left.</p><p>They were taken straight to their court side seats by an attendant and Rio felt the rush of being back in one of her favourite places in all the world.</p><p>The smell of the rubber, the hot dogs and the popcorn, god she could bathe in it.</p><p>Which reminded her, as Nicky began swinging his legs on the seat and Agatha shrugged her jacket off to reveal the ridiculously attractive way she wore her jersey: “Snacks? Who wants what? I’m getting a beer and nachos.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced a little but Nicky looked up and bounced a little in his seat, “Nachos!”</p><p>“And beer too?”</p><p>“No! Soda please.”</p><p>“Okay, coming right up. And for her ladyship?”</p><p>Rio looked up and grinned at Agatha who was now lounging back in her seat, looking surprisingly at home where she sat in amongst the crowds at TD Gardens.</p><p>She heard her name called as she stood up and she glanced up at the stands behind them to see a couple women waving frantically at her.</p><p>She smiled and turned back to Agatha, “So?”</p><p>She caught Agatha on the turn and arched a brow slightly, seeing Agatha work through something in her mind.</p><p>“Will you take Nicky? Show him the delights of a stadium snack hall?”</p><p>Nicky was already jumping from his seat and Rio had no choice but to accept the hand held out to her and she watched curiously as Agatha glanced back at the women now shouting again, calling Rio’s name over and over.</p><p>She wanted so desperately to say something, to ask if she were being sent away with Agatha’s child to ensure she didn’t return with a girl on her arm, but there was no way she could do it without either Nicky hearing or the whole stadium getting a shot of Rio Vidal whispering suggestively into Agatha Harkness’s ear.</p><p>She merely smiled and tugged Nicky in the direction of the food hall, pulling him in front of her when the crowds got a little close and guiding him by his shoulders.</p><p>A few people looked her way but most were polite enough to move swiftly on when they saw she had a child with her.</p><p>And Rio focused most of her attention on Nicky, making sure he was close and safe and that he saw all of the varieties of foods that would set his pulse racing and make his stomach churn if he had too much.</p><p>Just as they were waiting on their order - Rio, with the help of Nicky, had chosen a hotdog and a beer for Agatha - she felt a tap on her shoulder.</p><p>“Excuse me, are you Rio Vidal?”</p><p>“I am, yes.”</p><p>“Like the actress?”</p><p>The woman’s voice was so loud that even through the crowds Rio could feel people starting to turn. She felt Nicky turn his head where she still had a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Can I get a picture? I’m such a fan!”</p><p>Rio smiled and bit her lip briefly, “I usually would but I’m with my friend here so maybe another time.”</p><p>“Oh please?” The lady looked down to Nicky and raised her brows before looking back to Rio who’d turned to check on him too. “He looks so like you. He’s not…?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quickly, suddenly panicked that the assumption from a stranger that Nicky was her child would confuse the boy.</p><p>“A friend’s son.”</p><p>“Well are you sure on the quick selfie?”</p><p>“Yes, only if I do it for you I’ll have to-…”</p><p>“Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio glanced instinctively over her shoulder and felt Nicky turn that way too, her hold tightening on him as she spotted a man through the crowds pointing at her.</p><p>“Seriously, it’ll take a second.”</p><p>And as she turned back to the woman she flinched at the raised phone and the sight of herself on the little screen, Nicky’s cap just visible in the bottom corner.</p><p>“Please don’t do that,” Rio said sternly, holding her hand up, “I’m just trying to get snacks and get out of here.”</p><p>The woman grumbled something about Rio being ungrateful but Rio had already ducked down to speak directly to Nicky, “You okay? We won’t be much longer.”</p><p>“Mm’fine,” Nicky said quietly but he looked serious again where before he’d been wide-eyed and happy.</p><p>So Rio stood back up and pulled him closer, crossing one arm over him as she fished her phone out of her pocket and dialled for Agatha.</p><p>“Hey,” she said quickly as Agatha answered after one ring.</p><p>“No se asusten. ¿Podrían enviar a un empleado? Estamos cerca del puesto de comida, el número seis. Todo está bien.” <em>Don’t panic. Can you send an attendant to us? We’re at the food stand. Number six. Everything’s fine.</em></p><p>Rio heard her name rippling through the crowd and she wondered why she felt so exposed now, so vulnerable to it when usually she’d barely register it at all.</p><p>But then Nicky was holding her arm that sat across his chest and she realised with a pang that it was him who’d changed the way she felt.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Te prometo que estará a salvo conmigo.” <em>He’s safe with me, I promise.</em></p><p>There was a muffled noise on the end of the line as Rio moved two steps forwards with Nicky as the queue moved.</p><p>“Someone’s coming,” Agatha said and Rio could hear the panic in her voice and it broke her heart as that coupled with Nicky’s firm grip on her arm made her sick with emotions she didn’t have the desire to name.</p><p>“He’s fine, Agatha. I’m just being cautious,” she said in soft English, now more worried about reassuring Agatha than being overheard.</p><p>“Can you stay on until they’re with you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you getting mobbed?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>There was silence for a while as nothing much happened. But Rio began to relax a little and she hoped Agatha were too.</p><p>“Any pretty girls?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and bit her lip, glancing to the side to check that though people were looking they weren’t close enough to overhear her.</p><p>“Some.”</p><p>Rio felt Nicky toying with the fabric of her shirt and she glanced down at him, unable to see his face because of the angle. She gave him a gentle squeeze and he rocked his head back to look up at Rio and Rio grinned down at him matching his goofy smile.</p><p>“He’s quite the helper when it comes to-…”</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em> even say it.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and turned when she felt a tap on the shoulder and a man in a Celtics bib was smiling at her.</p><p>“They’re here,” she said into the phone.</p><p>“Hurry back.”</p><p>Rio hung up and placed her phone in her pocket as she spoke to the attendant in a low tone, her hold never relenting on Nicky, even as the attendant moved them away to a separate area and stayed close as he spoke to his colleagues through a radio.</p><p>Rio felt a little embarrassed that she’d been given special treatment but she couldn’t risk Nicky being hounded or photographed or scared so she turned her attention back to him and bent around to whisper to him, “Beer’s coming up!”</p><p>Nicky laughed just as Rio felt another tap on her shoulder and she straightened again, her grin fading at the sight of the two women from the stands before grinning at her.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Hey! We couldn’t find you for ages but we just <em>had</em> to say hi.”</p><p>“Hi,” Rio repeated, feeling Nicky toy with her shirt again. She cleared her throat and looked across the way to see if their food and drinks had arrived yet.</p><p>The attendant was still close by.</p><p>“We were wondering,” one of them started as the other clocked Nicky and made to lift his cap.</p><p>“Woah,” Rio said quickly, pushing her hand away as she pulled him back.</p><p>“Everything okay, Miss Vidal?”</p><p>Rio glanced at the attendant and then frowned back at the women, her other arm now crossing over Nicky too.</p><p>“Fine. Don’t touch my kid.”</p><p>The woman who’d done it just blinked and at least had the decency to flush at Rio’s sudden change in demeanour, apparently recognising that she’d overstepped.</p><p>Rio turned then, once sure no one would be trying to get to Nicky again, and asked the attendant if he wouldn’t mind bringing the food and drinks down to them and then gently guided Nicky back through the crowds and out to the stadium.</p><p>Only when at the top of the tunnel to get to their seats did Rio breathe again and she released Nicky’s hand to let him run to his mum and dive at her.</p><p>Even from afar she could see that Agatha looked relieved to have him back with her and Rio knew she couldn’t look as stressed as she felt so Agatha wouldn’t panic more so she schooled her face into a smile and took her seat back up.</p><p>“They’re bringing it out. We got you a hot dog.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, too busy kissing a wriggling Nicky on the cheek over and over to respond to the prospect of a stadium-cooked hotdog.</p><p>Rio turned away from the sight and lifted her cap off her head to shake her hair out, running her fingers through it as she watched the stadium slowly fill around them.</p><p>It took Agatha reaching over to nudge her arm for her to turn back.</p><p>“Are you going to be loud?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and laughed, “You cannot be questioning if <em>I</em> will be loud when-…”</p><p>But Agatha was smirking and Rio narrowed her eyes at her, aware suddenly that she’d been trying to pull her from her own thoughts.</p><p>“Yes. I like to cheer my team on.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as she surveyed Rio, “Well my team aren’t here so I won’t be cheering.”</p><p>“Your team is your son’s team and Nicky has chosen the best team in the world haven’t you, kid?”</p><p>She turned to Nicky who grinned and raised his hand to match Rio’s offered high five.</p><p>Agatha scoffed and Rio winked at her over Nicky’s head, replacing her cap back on her head again and grinning once more.</p><p>“Can I take a picture?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but nodded, turning herself more in her seat so Agatha could get a good angle.</p><p>“No, of the two of you.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head and watched Agatha for a second, moving automatically when Nicky turned around in his seat too to place a hand on his arm.</p><p>“By the pitch,” Agatha instructed as if it were the most casual thing in the world and she motioned for them both to go.</p><p>“Court,” Rio corrected with a genuinely soft smile as Agatha rolled her eyes. But she stood all the same and held her hand out to Nicky to pull him with her. She stood with him just on the edge of the court, holding his shoulders as she bent down to grin at the camera with him, both in their matching caps.</p><p>Agatha took a few snaps and laughed when Rio flipped both their caps to sit backwards on their heads and Nicky giggled as the picture was taken.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t help but beam up at Agatha, watching her as she checked the pictures she’d taken and moving to look over her shoulder at them. Her perfume filled her lungs and she had to step back, feeling dizzy with it suddenly.</p><p>A voice behind her saved her from her sudden turn and she looked to see the guy who’d come to rescue them standing with a large tray with their food and drink.</p><p>“Oh god, thank you.” She moved quickly forwards and helped him put it all down.</p><p>“Want me to take a picture of the three of you? I’ll get good angles, I promise.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“I’d love that,” Agatha said from where she was now beside Rio suddenly, “thank you.”</p><p>Rio felt her hand on her upper back as she leant over to pass her phone over and she turned to catch Agatha’s eye but she’d already looked away.</p><p>“Caps forwards? Caps back?” She asked with an attempt to pretend her stomach wasn’t doing flips at the prospect of being photographed with Agatha and Nicky. On Agatha’s phone. In front of thousands of people.</p><p>“Either,” Agatha said with a smirk, “both.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but suddenly became aware of her limbs as she approached Agatha’s side.</p><p>Nicky had fallen easily into place in front of his mum and Agatha’s hands were on his shoulders so Rio had to squash in.</p><p>“Feeling shy?” Agatha asked softly, raising a brow but continuing to smile as Rio hesitated. “Put your arm around me.”</p><p>But Rio’s limbs felt heavy and strangely long and she didn’t quite know how to move them until Agatha was reaching for her hand and lifting it, transferring it to her shoulder furthest from Rio so she moved closer so the stretch wasn’t so strange.</p><p>“Better,” Agatha muttered softly and Rio cleared her throat before she finally relaxed into it, curling her fingers properly around Agatha’s shoulder and turning to smile for the camera.</p><p>She was aware behind their photographer that a lot of the crowd were snapping shots too and she whispered, “Jen will be furious.”</p><p>“So let her be.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched in surprise as Agatha turned to smile at her, raising her chin slightly in challenge. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just… missing something.”</p><p>“And what might-…?”</p><p>But Rio had transferred her cap to Agatha’s head and was grinning at the sight.</p><p>“Perfect.”</p><p>She ruffled her own hair to make sure it was sitting okay and turned sharply to smile for the camera again, squeezing Agatha’s shoulder as she did.</p><p>“Idiot,” Agatha muttered quietly but Rio noted that she didn’t take the cap off.</p><p>“One with the two of them,” Rio said after a few more seconds of posing. She stole her cap back and replaced it on her head and strode away, turning to admire the view instead of the most beautiful woman in the stadium and her son.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her and Rio took in a sharp intake of breath because she was radiant. She was glowing. She was…</p><p><em>Shit.</em></p><p>She was in love.</p><p>Rio swallowed down the truth as if she’d been told to swallow a golf ball and saw that Agatha was now looking at her curiously, was adjusting herself with Nicky to lead him back and was approaching her.</p><p>But Rio looked away, turned to duck down and grab her beer so she had something to do, something to focus on when Agatha touched her arm but said nothing and made no enquiry into her sudden change in demeanour.</p><p>She’d been in the precipice of it for so long that she hadn’t even noticed that she’d tipped over.</p><p>That she’d fallen head first and hadn’t even noticed until she was swimming in her love for Agatha, drowning in it, and swallowing it down like the cool beer in her hand.</p><p>She’d downed half of it before she knew what she’d done.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio looked over and saw Nicky pointing at the tunnel, and looked up to see the cheerleaders begin to stream out.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced Agatha’s way, watching as she took a sip of her beer and almost managed to hide her grimace but Rio didn’t know if it was the beer or the young women now running out to the centre of the court that had caused it.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t look at Agatha any longer because she finally had an answer as to why it all hurt so much. Why she’d given in so easily.</p><p>But the lights were swirling, the music was picking up, and Nicky beside her was transfixed on the dancers, his large coke resting in his lap, almost the same size as him. And Rio decided to focus on him rather than the tempest of emotions storming through her.</p><p>“You think you could dance like that?”</p><p>“No. Mama dances.”</p><p>“Oh does she?”</p><p>Rio looked up to see Agatha glance her way and raise her brows, “What?”</p><p>“You dance like that? Nicky says you do.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and playfully tugged Nicky’s cap down to cover his eyes. He squealed and giggled and Agatha relented with a grin before she focused back in on Rio again.</p><p>“I think you know that isn’t true.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said with a smirk, “You have rhythm.”</p><p>Whether real or imaginary, Agatha blushed a little and Rio grinned at the sight of it, thrilled then that Agatha’s eyes dropped to it and she felt a little more of that hope that still stoked flames in her stomach.</p><p>But Agatha narrowed her gaze a little and Rio had to look away for fear she’d stare all night and turned instead to the dancers, choosing to focus in on them instead of the tragedy of the family beside her that she may be able to occasionally intrude on but would never be her own.</p><p>But the cheerleaders spot Rio and Agatha too and the little boy between them swinging his legs to the music and after the routine and the stadium applause, they all took their turns running around the perimeter and one stopped right in front of Rio.</p><p>“Rio, baby!”</p><p>And Rio recognised this woman when she was close up and she swallowed thickly, forcing her smile, “Hey!”</p><p>She stood quickly and gave the cheerleader a quick, one-armed hug.</p><p>“Who’s this little guy?” The woman pulled half back, their arms still around each other as Rio swung to look where she was pointing and saw Nicky look suddenly shy again.</p><p>“This is Nicky. He’s new to the Celtics family.”</p><p>Her gaze flicked across to Agatha and she saw that blue eyes were focused on Rio’s hand curled around the bare waist of the cheerleader whose name Rio did <em>not</em> remember.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said quickly, placing a reassuring hand on Nicky’s back before the cheerleader could address him.</p><p>“Rio, why don’t you introduce us?”</p><p><em>Bitch.</em> Rio thought suddenly, wondering briefly if she had a tell for not knowing someone’s name and how she could get Agatha to tell her what it was.</p><p>“Of course,” she said quickly, unable to think of anything else to say and simply offering her free hand to refer to Nicky and Agatha in turn.</p><p>Suddenly she was aware of the crowd around them, of the people taking photos and videos and she wondered if she would come out well from this or if she’d tank her career because of a brief dalliance with a cheerleader two years ago and her love for the woman in front of her.</p><p>“This is Nicky. And this is Agatha.”</p><p><em>God, fuck me. Kill me. Now.</em></p><p>Agatha was looking at Rio now, her brows raised, her jaw tight.</p><p>And Rio felt two things at once: how cruel it was that Agatha was doing this to her and how good it felt that she was doing this to her.</p><p>Because it meant she was jealous. Surely it meant she was jealous.<br/>
Nicky, shy as he was, held his hand out and Rio forgot her torment for a second and smiled down at him.</p><p>“Please to meet you, little one. I’m Danielle.”</p><p><em>Thank fuck,</em> Rio thought.</p><p>Nicky shook the woman’s hand and Rio moved away from her, withdrawing her arm from around her waist and turning to her properly.</p><p>“Think you could get us in with the players?”</p><p>“Babe, I’m barely allowed to be here for as long as I’ve been.”</p><p>And the lights moved and changed and Phil Collins began blasting signally the team’s imminent arrival so Rio and Danielle looked around them before their eyes met again.</p><p>“Leave it with me.”</p><p>Rio grinned genuinely at the woman and settled back down in her seat, her excitement overwhelming her previous concerns as she turned to Nicky to shake his shoulder but she saw Agatha’s hand already curled around it and her expression tense but purposefully softened for the lens she knew would be on them.</p><p>“She’s pretty.”</p><p>Rio’s brows raised from Nicky to Agatha and she tilted her head a little, her tongue poking in the side of her cheek.</p><p>“Old friend,” she said enigmatically and caught the flash in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>The crowd roared into life around them and even the promise of her precious Celtics couldn’t tear her away from blue eyes.</p><p>But Nicky was on his feet and almost spilling his soda and so Rio had to shift her focus to the little boy as Agatha did too. And silently, without acknowledgement, they put everything aside to focus on making sure Agatha’s son had the best time of his life.</p><p>Rio took it upon herself to become the pseudo commentator for the little boy, making sure he knew who everyone was, what the plays were, why things were fouls and why other things were not fouls (“biased ref, hates the C’s”).</p><p>And Agatha spent half the time watching Nicky too, holding the back of his oversized jersey when he stood on his seat for a better view, and otherwise shooting glances at Rio as she dedicated her time teaching and entertaining her son.</p><p>By the time half-time was called Rio was exhausted from imparting her knowledge and screaming at the court.</p><p>Nicky was high as a kite on the excitement of the thing and due to the excess soda he’d consumed.</p><p>And Agatha was, and looked, more relaxed than she had in a long while.</p><p>Even as the boards began to light up and cameras headed their way she didn’t seem concerned or fussed at all as the spotlight first fell to her.</p><p>And Rio looked up at the jumbotron with a grin, beaming at the sight of Agatha’s smiling face on it. The crowds went wild for her. And she could see why.</p><p>Agatha Harkness sporting their team’s jersey was a win even if you weren’t a huge fan.</p><p>But the camera moved and suddenly Rio was on the board. She was a known fan. A known frequenter of games. So this was perhaps less exciting for everyone but she still received a huge cheer from the crowd as she waved and gestured for them to get louder for her.</p><p>And they sure did.</p><p>Nicky was giggling by her side and when the camera was away again Rio turned to stick her tongue out at him before she looked across at Agatha and raised her brows, “Oh Jen’s gonna be maaaaad.”</p><p>“Screw Jen.”</p><p>Rio laughed and reached down for her now warm beer, and finished it in one go, relaxing back in her seat as she luxuriated in the day out and vacation from her recent working life where she’d barely had time to think, let alone enjoy.</p><p>And then there was the happy kid bouncing to the music beside her and the woman beyond him, pulling him in to cuddle him into her side and ask him questions about the game.</p><p>Rio looked around at them and felt herself yearn once more.</p><p>The way Agatha was softer for Nicky, the way she sometimes was with Rio.</p><p>The way her hands brushed the soft hair sitting along his upper back, the hands that had done that to Rio, the hands that had held her own and caressed her cheek.</p><p>Agatha looked up then, her chin rested on Nicky’s head as he settled against her and she smiled curiously across at Rio, watching her watch them for a while before she shouted above the noise.</p><p>“Are you having fun?”</p><p>“Like you wouldn’t believe.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then turned her head to kiss the top of Nicky’s and the game started again.</p><p>Rio resumed her new favourite role of Nicky’s personal entertainer and lifted him from his seat when the final whistle blew and their team won.</p><p>Nicky tried his best to give Rio tinnitus by screaming loudly by her ear but Rio didn’t mind because she too was bellowing her pleasure at the court.</p><p>Agatha didn’t shout but at least stood and clapped and soon moved closer to place her hands on both of their backs.</p><p>“Did you win?”</p><p>“Shut up!” Rio laughed, placing Nicky back on his feet again so she wouldn’t lose her hearing and her ability to stand straight for the next week.</p><p>“You know we did.”</p><p>Nicky was beaming so much that Rio worried he might actually break his face and then she saw it. He put his tongue between his teeth and giggled as Agatha took him into her arms and something triggered in her brain that she hadn’t noticed before.</p><p>They did look similar.</p><p>Her face fell slightly as she stared at him and Agatha caught it, and tugged at her shirt, making her eyes dart over.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Nicky was looking around and he turned serious again, frowning where Rio must look stricken.</p><p>“Nothing, nothing.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and tried to shake it off. Maybe it was a trick of the light. Maybe it was an overspill from her desire to be with Agatha.</p><p>Of her love for Agatha.</p><p>Regardless, it didn’t mean anything.</p><p>“We should wait a little,” Agatha was saying quietly, “just so the crowds are a little less. That security guard will be there when we get out the stadium but best just wait.”</p><p>Rio only nodded and lifted her cap to shake out her hair, and her attention was caught as she did as the cheerleader from before ran over and straight into her arms.</p><p>Releasing a soft noise when their bodies collided, Rio cleared her throat quietly.</p><p>“I had a word. Do you want to come back? You can wait in the tunnel when the guys come out the locker room.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio babbled, unaware her hand was being held and blue eyes were down on it.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>“Nicky?” Rio turned to Agatha and Nicky and saw the little boy hiding half against his mum now, blinking up at the cheerleader shyly.</p><p>“Want to come meet the team?”</p><p>“No thank you.”</p><p>“No?” Rio asked with a frown and dropped down to crouch before him, tweaking his cap up a little so she could see his face better, “Are you sure?”</p><p>Agatha bent down too, turning Nicky so the three now sat in a triangle, all the same level, all facing each other, Rio and Agatha knocking knees.</p><p>“Yes, mama.”</p><p>“Okay, honey. Why don’t we go back to the hotel and order some chicken nuggets instead?”</p><p>Nicky smiled at this and nodded furiously which made Rio’s concerns fade quickly but Agatha had taken her knee just as she’d made to stand again.</p><p>“You can stay with your friend if you want.”</p><p>“No,” Rio frowned, “no. I’ll come with you.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded and dropped her hold on Rio’s knee as they both straightened and Rio turned to break the news to Danielle.</p><p>“Maybe another time?”</p><p>“You have my number. Maybe use it sometime?”</p><p>Rio received a kiss on the cheek and the woman was gone, leaving only the three of them now by the edge of the court and Agatha avoiding her eye.</p><p>“A friend,” she repeated with raised brows even as she looked anywhere but at Rio.</p><p>“Yes. A pretty one.”</p><p>Agatha looked around then and Rio smiled a little at the intensity of her expression but didn’t push it.</p><p>Soon enough the attendant was back with them and as the stragglers left the stadium, so did they. Rio hung back a little to keep an eye on Agatha and Nicky from behind, intent on making sure there were no surprise fan interactions that would ruin the rest of their day.</p><p>They moved through the whispered sounds of their names and the unsubtle pictures being taken without much hassle and when they finally cracked the outer shell of the stadium and hit the cool outside air they were guided back to the waiting car with security in tow - which made Rio feel a hell of a lot better.</p><p>Nicky slid in first this time with Agatha in the middle and Rio bringing up the rear.</p><p>She felt the press of Agatha’s thigh against hers before she’d even properly settled in her seat and in the pretext of putting on her seatbelt she brushed her hand over the small of Agatha’s back, enjoying for a second the secret proximity to the woman she’d hopelessly fallen for.</p><p>By the time they were bundled back into Agatha’s suite, Rio was exhausted with the energy of the day.</p><p>She was left to lounge whilst Nicky went find something in his room and Agatha went to see he was fine before she came back out and sat by Rio’s hip on the couch.</p><p>“You’re so good with him.”</p><p>“He’s easy to be around.”</p><p>“What happened in line for food?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t have-…”</p><p>Rio sighed and sat slowly, now sitting level with Agatha on the couch and reaching to hold her wrist gently, as if that would help calm her.</p><p>“If I hadn’t had Nicky with me it would have been fine, and it was. I… I just wanted someone there. Just in case. I didn’t want him to freak out.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw was working, flexing and unflexing with every clench of her teeth but her eyes were still soft and she nodded slowly, dropping her gaze to where Rio held her wrist.</p><p>“He’s shy.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You did the right thing. I shouldn’t have sent him with you in the first place.”</p><p>“Why did you?”</p><p>But Rio knew why. Agatha had thought with Nicky there Rio wouldn’t flirt. Would be too distracted. And she was right, obviously. But she didn’t know that Rio wasn’t interested in flirting with anyone anymore.</p><p>Anyone that wasn’t Agatha, anyway.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond and instead squeezed Rio’s hand gently before she stood from the couch.</p><p>“I’ll order food.”</p><p>Rio watched her go and then watched Nicky arrive back in the room holding up a mini basketball.</p><p>“Can we play?”</p><p>Rio laughed and glanced at Agatha who had pursed her lips in response, clearly not keen on the idea of her son and Rio smashing expensive vases in an expensive suite.</p><p>“Not tonight, buddy. But next time, okay? We gotta get you good enough to be captain of the Celtics!”</p><p>The little boy only nodded and jumped up on the couch beside her, throwing the ball up in the air to catch and soon they’d devised a game whereby they sat at opposite ends and gently tossed the ball back and forth.</p><p>Which Agatha only allowed because they’d get to fumble it and even when Nicky’s aim was off Rio could reach out to catch it before it drifted off to cause any permanent damage.</p><p>They evening went by happily, with Nicky entertained by Rio’s post-match analysis and thoughts on how she’d have done things differently and scored at least ten more points.</p><p>And Agatha contributed only to ask questions that would make Nicky laugh and Rio roll her eyes.</p><p>They feasted on nuggets and pizza and Nicky even got a special bowl of chocolate ice cream delivered and soon enough they lounged all on the same couch, with Agatha’s arm casually draped over Rio’s thigh and a tired little boy tucked into her side, unaware of his mother’s hold on the woman the other side of her.</p><p>The whole time Rio felt like she was flying.</p><p>She had Agatha back.</p><p>Nicky liked her.</p><p>Nicky wanted to talk to her or keep her talking.</p><p>And Agatha was smiling or laughing or rolling her eyes.</p><p>It was a facsimile of a family again. And Rio wanted it to last forever.</p><p>But Nicky had to be taken to bed and the illusion dissolved as the reality of being alone with Agatha meant she had to be brave, be bold, be as clear as she could be about how she felt about her.</p><p>Nicky gave her a quick hug and then Agatha whispered, “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>And she was alone, waiting for the woman she loved to come back to her.</p>

<p>Rest assured Jen and Alice will have ~thoughts about this little field trip but I wanted to focus on the little trio before any mention of ~that comes up again (also Rio never checks her phone and Agatha will have purposefully been ignoring it)</p>
<p>Anyone who spots Rio’s grammar mistake when protecting Nicky gets a hug from me</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio sat in the familiar position on Agatha Harkness’s couch, albeit in an unfamiliar hotel suite, waiting on Agatha to return to her from putting Nicky to bed.</p><p>Unlike before she knew what was to happen when she came back to her because she was going to take control.</p><p>She had to.</p><p>She was going to come clean, to tell Agatha that it was more than the crush Alice had told her about, it was more than incredible sex and a lust so undeniable she felt like she was on fire whenever Agatha touched her.</p><p>She’d never been the first to say it, never been the first to feel it, but now, now she’d gone and fallen for the most famous woman in the world who just happened to be married, who just so happened to want her too. Maybe just not <em>love</em> her.</p><p>And maybe Agatha would pull away again, she thought, or maybe it would go how she hoped.</p><p>Agatha would tell her she was divorcing Ralph, that she was going to run away with her, that they could buy a cottage somewhere in the woods and live a happy and easy life just the three of them.</p><p>Just as Rio were imagining a forest-themed basketball court, Agatha appeared again.</p><p>“Hey, he okay?”</p><p>“Fast asleep,” Agatha said with a small smile, eyeing the dishes Rio had piled up on the side.</p><p>“You’re a good house guest.”</p><p>“I try.”</p><p>“Wine?”</p><p>Rio nodded with a smile and reached to hold her glass for Agatha when she came to pour the rest of the wine they’d started earlier.</p><p>The bottle was finished by the time Agatha filled her own glass and Rio pulled her legs beneath her as they leant to cheers.</p><p>“To an incredible win today.”</p><p>“To you making Nicky’s day.”</p><p>Rio paused before she drank and began to second guess herself once more. If Agatha did pull away then she’d take Nicky with her too and as much as she barely knew the kid she’d grown fond of him.</p><p>Or maybe everything Agatha had told her about the reason for his existence, the fact even she could now see they looked alike, his shitty dad, it was all making Rio feel protective of him.</p><p>Rio drank down more than a mouthful of the wine and noticed Agatha watching her carefully. But she’d turned away, glancing briefly in the direction of Nicky’s door, just taking a second to breathe.</p><p>She felt a shift beside her and a hand on her cheek and Agatha was turning her head to kiss her.</p><p>And Rio could have cried for it, could have suffered a thousand humiliations to just feel the way she currently felt with Agatha leaning into her, holding her in place so their lips could be together for the first time in over a month.</p><p>But it lasted barely five seconds and Agatha was talking again, her thumb tracing the familiar sweep over her cheek.</p><p>“It’s been too long.”</p><p>Rio reacted only by lifting her hand to curl around the thin fabric at the neck of Agatha’s new jersey and she swallowed before she whispered, “We need to talk.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away then and broke Rio’s hold on her as she put at least two feet of distance between them, her blue eyes over on the bar.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said softly, frowning at the reaction, unable to reach back out for fear she’d be rejected again.</p><p>“More wine?”</p><p>Agatha asked suddenly, pushing herself up from the sofa and grabbing her glass to march to the bar at the end of the room.</p><p>Rio watched silently, her traitorous heart thrumming in her chest as her eyes scanned over Agatha as she sourced a bottle from the fridge and proceeded to open it with an expert flourish.</p><p>“You never did tell me why the four.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her mind so cloudly she couldn’t determine the question.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha turned over her shoulder as she tugged the cork from the bottle with a soft <em>pop</em>. “My shirt.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to the large ‘4’ displayed on Agatha’s front and she felt herself blush for it.</p><p>“It’s just a number.”</p><p>“Then why react this way every time I ask.”</p><p>Rio bit down on the inside of her cheek, knowing Agatha well enough now to know she wouldn’t drop it.</p><p>“It was a random number, or was supposed to be. I knew the players wouldn’t mean anything to you so I was just trying to come up with a number and,” she shrugged and watched as Agatha slowly walked back to where she sat on the couch, stopping just before her with a bottle in one hand and her glass in the other, “you have four little freckles on your nose. Tiny ones. I only noticed them the last time we-… anyway they’re in a vertical line and they’re… whatever… four.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t react for a second and Rio feared she might laugh but she maintained eye contact and refused to look away. If she backed down now, she’d never get through the night.</p><p>The woman before her slowly came back to life, stepping past her and sitting down beside her.</p><p>“Drink your wine,” she said in a soft voice, her gaze elsewhere as she lifted her own glass to drink down the remnants of the wine there.</p><p>Rio did as she was told and winced slightly at the volume of the liquid that poured down her throat.</p><p>But Agatha was soon filling her glass back up with the new wine and their eyes met again. She looked softer again, far more at ease than she had been when Rio had suggested they talk.</p><p>And Rio had to look away for fear if Agatha kissed her again she’d forget about talking altogether.</p><p>“Have things,” Rio started slowly, knowing she needed to get to the point quickly or she’d get drunk or too nervous and wouldn’t be able to get to what she knew she needed to bring up, “with Ralph, have they been… any better?”</p><p>“Ralph’s fine,” Agatha said curtly.</p><p>Rio turned to look at Agatha then and saw her focus in on her wine, saw the flex in her jaw.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over and Rio almost lost her nerve entirely.</p><p>“Have you had sex with him since we were together?”</p><p>Agatha turned away again and took down another gulp of wine. Rio held her glass in her lap, one hand curled around the cup, the other toying with the stem.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only breathe a silent sigh of relief that nobody had touched Agatha since she last had. Least of all Ralph.</p><p>The man who didn’t deserve her but had her all the same.</p><p>“Have you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, watched Agatha eye her for a while and then turn away again.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p><em>No one compares. I’ve barely had the energy to think because I’ve spent the last month learning lines and thinking about you. I just want you. All the time.</em></p><p>“Agatha,” Rio started softly, shifting where she sat to lean forwards a little but something sparked in the woman opposite and Agatha looked panicked suddenly, fearful.</p><p>“Don’t,” she said quickly, “don’t say something sweet. Not again.”</p><p>Rio frowned and reached out, knowing her fingers would be cool from where she’d held her wine glass, and they curled around Agatha’s warm bicep and Agatha mercifully didn't pull away.</p><p>“Then don’t ask me why.”</p><p>Rio moved her thumb slowly across warm skin, watching Agatha’s profile tense and then release again, the pattern repeating over and over until Rio couldn’t take it anymore and she eventually spoke:</p><p>“Will you leave Ralph?”</p><p>“You can’t ask me that.”</p><p>“I deserve to know.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her arm away then and took a quick sip of wine, “Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because we’ve been having an affair.”</p><p>“We slept together twice. That’s all.”</p><p>And Rio blinked, moved back an inch like she’d been physically pushed away.</p><p>“It’s more than that.”</p><p>“Is it?”</p><p>“You know it is.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and ran a hand through her hair, and turned her body away slightly, raising her arm to the back of the sofa to rest her elbow there.</p><p>“I’m married, Rio.”</p><p>“And you don’t have to be.”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head and turned away fully, her gaze on the dark night sky out the window.</p><p>Rio swallowed down her dignity and placed her glass on the side as she moved to sit just an inch from Agatha, her hand slowly reaching to turn her head to her.</p><p>“Don’t push me away.”</p><p>“You’ve got what you wanted. I don’t need to push.”</p><p>Rio frowned at the woman before her, the woman who was now freezing her out, let alone pushing her.</p><p>But she’d backed off before when Agatha’s intention had been the opposite and so she had to try. Just once more. Just one more difficult conversation.</p><p>And then she’d back away if Agatha didn’t open up.</p><p>If she didn’t soften even slightly to her.</p><p>“I want you. I thought I’d made that clear.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything and so Rio ducked her head to try and catch her gaze again, and she felt Agatha’s hand move to her lap and she exhaled slowly, wondering if this was a sign of her softening.</p><p>Lithe fingers curled, two of them looping into the belt loop at the front of her jeans.</p><p>She was tangling them together, loosely, barely, but she was holding her.</p><p>So Rio persevered.</p><p>“You should leave him.”</p><p>The words floated between them, carried forth like a prayer to an apathetic god with the power to grant wishes but no desire to wield it.</p><p>“You don’t understand.”</p><p>Rio shifted and dropped her hold from Agatha’s cheek to curl around the side of her neck, her fingers settling in the soft hair at the back of her head.</p><p>She took a breath, made more confident by the fingers that were still curled in her belt loop but fearful because Agatha hadn’t looked up at her yet.</p><p>“No, I don’t. You don’t love him. You don’t even <em>like</em> him. You have money and means and-…”</p><p>“It’s more complicated than that.”</p><p>“And you have someone waiting for you on the other side.”</p><p>Agatha took a breath and she looked up, her expression changing from frustration to confusion and back again.</p><p>“Don’t,” she said quietly. “You can’t keep saying things like that.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, “I mean it. If you wanted me I’d be here.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelids flickered and Rio thought she was going to look away but she kept her gaze steady on Rio’s face, her irises now whirlpools as Rio moved her free hand down to rest against Agatha’s in her lap.</p><p>“Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“You’re too young. You’re-…”</p><p>Rio captured whatever the next excuse was going to be in a soft kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth. She felt Agatha tighten her hold on her pants and she shifted closer to press their lips together properly.</p><p>Just as she moved to deepen the kiss, to feed the beast within her that had been craving Agatha for the past six weeks she felt a tear brush her nose and she frowned as she broke the contact suddenly.</p><p>Agatha gasped at the suddenness of Rio moving away and turned from her, releasing her hold.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered gently, feeling her own eyes begin to sting with the promise of tears.</p><p>But Agatha was moving away, placing her wine down and standing in one swift movement.</p><p>“I need to check on Nicky.”</p><p>Rio could only watch as she left, could only feel the crushing realisation that even pushing Agatha wasn’t going to work. And when she heard the door close softly to Nicky’s bedroom she moved to knock back the remainder of her wine, staring down at the coffee table as she contemplated what to do next.</p><p>Losing Agatha entirely was inconceivable.</p><p>Being made to go through the next few months able to see her but not be with her was too horrifying to contemplate.</p><p>Agatha was gone for more than five minutes and Rio was beginning to believe that she’d simply locked herself away with Nicky so Rio couldn’t get to her.</p><p>But she arrived back in the room when Rio was already halfway through her next glass of wine and sat cradling it with her knees pulled close to her chest.</p><p>“He’ll try and take him,” Agatha said from across the room, her voice barely above a whisper as if she feared voicing her fears would bring them to life.</p><p>“What we have works. What we’ve built works. I’m as happy as I ever thought I’d get to be. I have Nicky. I… I told you that first night. My work and Nicky is all I need.”</p><p>And Rio felt like someone had dropped a house on her heart. Like somehow it had shattered inside her body and was floating around in the hollow of her chest, so sharp and visceral was the pain of it.</p><p>“You’re happy with me too,” Rio said after a few seconds of getting used to this new feeling of utter devastation.</p><p>She raised her gaze slowly to meet Agatha’s and watched her twist the hem of her jersey in her fingers, watched her flex her jaw and drop her gaze to Rio’s calves.</p><p>And Rio knew it was true. Knew that the smiles hadn’t been false. That the soft touches and the way Agatha reached for her when no one was looking couldn’t have been fake.</p><p>“I can’t lose him.”</p><p>“Ralph wouldn’t take him from you.”</p><p>“Ralph,” Agatha started and then clenched her jaw and Rio saw in her eyes that same distant look she’d seen before, that same cloudiness that sometimes came over Agatha and made Rio want to reach in and pull her back.</p><p>“Ralph should have married some sweet girl who wanted to stay home and cook for him. Instead he married me and he won’t let me humiliate him.”</p><p>Rio sat forwards then, planting her feet firmly on the floor and her elbows on her knees.</p><p>“Then why did he marry you?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped and Rio watched as she held her empty left ring finger in her right hand, her eyes still that same distant way.</p><p>“Our mothers are friends. It was a set up. One neither of us had much choice in. And then my career took off and he had to move to LA with me and I got pregnant and we became the dream couple.”</p><p>She trailed off with a venom in her tone, a sarcastic spiteful lilt to the last two words.</p><p>A marriage of convenience. A forced one. Rio felt white hot fury flash through her, adding to the sharp pain still present in her chest.</p><p>It was needless then. Agatha’s misery was needless.</p><p>She clenched her fists over her knees and forced herself to calm down, but the idea of Agatha being shackled to a man because of a choice her mother had made was intolerable.</p><p>Inconceivable.</p><p>Irredeemable.</p><p>She took a deep breath and dropped her head, closing her eyes for a second before she trusted herself to speak again.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said tentatively, “No judge would ever look at you and Nicky and want to tear you apart.”</p><p>“I’m the parent who travels more. I’m the parent who-…”</p><p>“You’re the parent who <em>loves</em> Nicky. Ralph barely looked at him when I saw them together.”</p><p>“He’ll try and take him. Even if it were joint custody… even if I couldn’t see my son for-…”</p><p>But Agatha stopped talking and Rio looked back up with wide eyes and saw that the woman before her was wiping away tears.</p><p>She stood without thinking and strode over without hesitance and pulled Agatha into a tight hug that the older woman melted into, pressing her face into the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>And the fact that Agatha held her just as tightly meant that the shards of her shattered heart softened slightly. The hollowness faded somewhat and she filled herself instead with the promise that Agatha was hers again, if only briefly, if only for the amount of time she was allowed to hold her.</p><p>The soft breathing against her neck began to even out and Rio felt Agatha’s lips brush her tentatively before she pulled away and pressed their foreheads together.</p><p>Agatha smelt like her perfume, the wine she’d been drinking, and something that Rio couldn’t name but that reminded her of home.</p><p>“Will you stay tonight? Just to be here. Just one last time?”</p><p>Rio nodded gently and leant in to press their lips together, some of the pain returning at Agatha’s suggestion that this would be it, that they’d never get to do this again or be this close.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured quietly, frowning a little at the sight of the freckles across Agatha’s nose she’d only had the fortune to spot once and now she’d never get to see them again.</p><p>“If you change your mind about Ralph, if you ever do, I’ll wait for you.”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly where Agatha’s hold tightened all of a sudden and she raised her head a little, her heart hammering so hard in her chest that she thought she’d go deaf because of it.</p><p>But Agatha was gazing at her with those blue eyes that swirled with tears again and Rio knew she was looking for the lie, looking for hesitance in Rio that would never show because Rio was sure now. She knew what she wanted and she had to make Agatha see it. She had to let Agatha know.</p><p>She took a breath.</p><p>“I’m in l-…”</p><p>“Don’t, Rio.” Agatha said urgently, her hold still impossibly tight around Rio’s waist as tears began to fall and her face crumpled before her. “Don’t say it. Don’t. Please don’t.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond to tell Agatha she had to because she had to know but Agatha was crying properly now and Rio could only shake her head and then pull Agatha back against her neck, gasping softly at the physical feel of her tears against her, at the possessive hold of her waist and the lips that moved soundlessly against her skin, breathing silent words and delivering damp promises.</p><p>Rio’s own body began to give in, whether from lack of oxygen as she took in short, shallow breaths, or the way Agatha was breaking down in her arms, she buried her face in Agatha’s hair and cried for what could have been, what should have been, and what never was.</p><p>Agatha pulled away only when her tears had dried and her breath was hitching just every thirty seconds instead of every ten.</p><p>She blindly nudged her face into Rio’s, directing her to turn and when she did so she found her lips and poured the silent despair into a kiss.</p><p>Rio whimpered softly, her own tears still running where Agatha’s had dried.</p><p>It felt like a goodbye. Like all hope was gone because Agatha was opening up to the pain of it properly for the first time.</p><p>And she wasn’t offering an alternative.</p><p>“I can’t breathe, Agatha,” she gasped quietly when Agatha squeezed her more and she pulled back a little.</p><p>Agatha relented and took Rio’s hand, stepping away and silently pulling Rio through to her bedroom where she tugged her into the middle of the bed with her.</p><p>Rio was hiccuping softly now, the heel of her free hand rubbing harshly against her eyes to try and stem the flow of tears but it didn’t help. It just made them sting more.</p><p>But she’d take physical pain any day over the torment of her jagged, shattered heart.</p><p>Agatha released her once sure she wasn’t going to leave the bed and she shuffled to undo her own pants, throwing them from the bed when they were removed.</p><p>She’d recovered faster than Rio had and Rio still felt shaky, still felt weak. So Agatha took charge and lay her back. She removed her jeans easily and threw them away too before she pulled the duvet up and over them, trapping them both beneath it and laying cautiously on top of Rio, their legs now tangled and their tear-dampened chests pressed together.</p><p>It hurt more to have Agatha like this, to have her gazing down at her like she was precious, like she couldn’t bear to let her go or let her leave, but she’d said it was the last time and so Rio didn’t protest, didn’t try to protect herself or her heart.</p><p>Her arms simply wrapped around Agatha and held her down against her because pain was better than absence.</p><p>“You deserve so much more,” Agatha whispered once Rio’s arms were snug around her and the another of her soft hiccups had died in her throat.</p><p>Rio shook her head and frowned deeply, “I deserve you. I want you.”</p><p>“I can’t be what you want me to be.”</p><p>“I want you to be mine. But I want you to be,” a soft hiccup interrupted her and a soft twitch at the side of Agatha’s lips told Rio that she was softening for her once more, if only slightly, only a hiccup’s worth.</p><p>“I want you to be happy. And know that you don’t need to stay in a marriage because you think it’s easier or because you’re afraid.”</p><p>Agatha ducked her head slowly then and kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth. “I’m not afraid of Ralph. Just what he could do to Nicky.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach lurched as Agatha brushed their noses and she hiccuped again, her diaphragm unable to settle yet when her mind and body were working overtime to not breakdown again.</p><p>“That boy will always be yours. He is not his father’s son.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again and Rio frowned up at her when she pulled back a little, the hand that had been resting on the pillow now moving to sweep dark hair from her forehead.</p><p>“Does Ralph love you?”</p><p>Agatha’s forefinger trailed down the curve of her cheek until it hit Rio’s chin and she held it there a while before answering.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Does he love Nicky?”</p><p>“Not the way he should.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, searching in blue eyes for what Agatha was thinking, how she was feeling, but unable to find her again.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began tentatively, her hold tightening around the woman above her who was now focused on her fingers as they made the same journey from Rio’s forehead down to her jaw again.</p><p>Agatha was distracting herself, avoiding her gaze, she knew that much. But she kept her hold on her tight even as she hiccuped softly again before finishing what she’d started: “Has anyone ever told you they love you before?”</p><p>Like a moth to a flame Agatha’s eyes darted back up to Rio’s and Rio knew she’d guessed right immediately. She knew she’d been right to assume that Agatha was testing her still, that she still didn’t believe Rio because she’d never had reassurance from anyone else.</p><p>Not in this way. Not in any true way that mattered.</p><p>Agatha moved her head just an inch but it was enough confirmation and Rio didn’t push it for both their sakes.</p><p>She felt dizzy with the idea that Agatha was loved the world over, adored in every corner, praised so often that her name was legendary, but that no one had made Agatha feel as loved as she deserved to.</p><p>But Agatha was rolling off of her, slipping into her side and Rio rolled with her, already missing the weight of her body on top of her.</p><p>Only she didn’t pull away, she simply pressed closer and this time wrapped her arms around Rio again, keeping their legs tangled until her hand eventually slipped down to rub along Rio’s thigh and she lifted it to loop over her hips.</p><p>“I meant what I said,” another soft hiccup and a twitch of Agatha’s lips in response, “I’ll wait for you.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha squeeze her over her knee and then brush back up to her thigh, finding the fabric of her underwear at her hip and twisting it in her fingers. It didn’t feel like a request, it felt instead like something to hold onto and so Rio remained still, watching Agatha with a steady gaze even as she hiccuped again.</p><p>“I don’t want you to.”</p><p>“Then tell me not to.”</p><p>Agatha closed her mouth and dropped her gaze to Rio’s lips and remained still, the only movement under the hot duvet that guarded them from the outside world now the soft brushes of Agatha’s thumb along the soft skin at the top of Rio’s thigh.</p><p>Rio hiccuped softly again and this time Agatha’s lips didn’t reacted. She simply remained silent and gazed at Rio’s parted lips, lost in her own mind again.</p><p>And through the silence, piece by piece, Rio’s heart began to slowly mend itself.</p><p>“When you’re ready,” Rio whispered tentatively, watching as Agatha kept her gaze down, “I want to tell you what I was trying to earlier.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand up to caress Agatha’s cheek and she closed her eyes, turning into Rio’s touch.</p><p>Rio moved then to kiss her and felt her kiss back, somehow more sure in it than she’d been all night, somehow more demanding of her.</p><p>The hand twisted in her underwear tightened its hold and pulled to press their hips together, fitting as flush as two puzzle pieces.</p><p>Rio’s body betrayed her and she hiccuped against Agatha’s lips and felt her smile properly against them, felt her adjust them so Agatha was pushing her onto her back again and she was settling between Rio’s legs that had parted to let her.</p><p>She kissed her once, twice, three times before she pulled away and cupped her cheek.</p><p>“You’ll need to sneak out early.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and dropped her gaze to Rio’s lips again, brushing them over with the pad of her thumb.</p><p>“When’s your flight tomorrow?”</p><p>“Early. I have press in the afternoon.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said quietly, a soft frown forming on her face even as Rio now tugged her jersey up to seek the warmth of her skin beneath.</p><p>“You really haven’t slept with anyone else?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“They’re not you.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said quietly, dragging her hand down slowly to rest across her throat, “Don’t-…”</p><p>“Say things like that, I know.”</p><p>Rio hiccuped softly and Agatha’s gaze darted back up as her thumb rested in the hollow of her throat, her fingers still curled gently around it.</p><p>“We can’t… not tonight.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I want to be loud and free with it and I can’t be.”</p><p>“We can go soft and slow.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond except to drag her hand down between them, brushing over Rio’s breast until she could twist it and slide it into her underwear.</p><p>Rio whimpered and adjusted a little beneath her to reach down and mimic her movements, finding  Agatha as needy as ever when they’d barely touched.</p><p>“Tell me before you’re about to come, okay?” Rio whispered as she stirred her hips slightly with the movement of Agatha’s now familiar touches.</p><p>“I want to make it last longer.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and only moaned a little with the first brush of her clit and she buried her face into Rio’s neck to dampen her noises.</p><p>Rio’s free arm wrapped around Agatha to hold her there, burying her fingers in dark hair and she found tears forming in her eyes as Agatha buried her fingers inside of her for the first time in weeks.</p><p>She had missed this, missed the way her body responded and ached for Agatha whenever she was touching her. The way she clenched around her when she was inside of her. The way her body squirmed and writhed with barely any reason to simply because Agatha was close.</p><p>But she focused on what she was doing, focused on the breathing against her neck that was picking up and the rocking of Agatha’s hips into her hand with every thrust.</p><p>She was close already, and she slowed down, making Agatha whine quietly, her own thrusts increasing in strength and vigour so that Rio arched up and into her, feeling Agatha’s mouth open against her neck and her tongue trace a thick line along it.</p><p>She groaned and rocked until with one expert twist of Agatha’s hand she came below her, biting down on her own lip to not make as much noise as she wanted to.</p><p>But Agatha was vibrating above her, rocking desperately against Rio’s hand where she’d halted her movements.</p><p>Seconds after Rio came Agatha pulled up and removed her hand from her underwear to place her fingers into Rio’s panting mouth, letting her suck herself off of them as Agatha continued to rock against her.</p><p>“Rio. Rio. Fuck me. Harder. Properly. Baby. Now.”</p><p>Rio lost all sense of her plans to build Agatha up and instead with her tongue swirling around her fingers she pressed more firmly into the woman bucking greedily above her and bullied her clit until Agatha arched her back and came with a silent scream above her.</p><p>The sight was otherworldly.</p><p>She looked magnificent.</p><p>And Rio was so in love with her.</p><p>Agatha collapsed back down against her and pulled her fingers from Rio’s mouth to instead encircle her arms around her, sliding them up and under her shoulders so Rio had to pull out and simply hold Agatha against her.</p><p>A soft moan fell to her ear as Rio scratched her back gently beneath her jersey and Rio smiled at the feel of the vibration against her chest.</p><p>“I was going to build you up.”</p><p>“Don’t care,” Agatha mumbled quietly, pressing her nose to Rio’s ear. “Don’t need it.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and closed her eyes, turning her head slowly to breathe Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha soon pulled back to look down at Rio properly and she smiled lazily at the sight of Rio’s dark eyes.</p><p>“How much longer do you have with filming?”</p><p>“It’ll take me up to Christmas.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and her smile faded slowly, “Okay.”</p><p>“Can I see you again?”</p><p>“I need some time, Rio.”</p><p>Rio could only nod because she feared she’d release a sob if she opened her mouth. And Agatha seemed to know this too so she leant in and pressed a gentle kiss to pouting lips and whispered against them, “You should sleep.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut as Agatha brushed her lips across her cheek, to her nose, and up to her forehead where she kissed her again.</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>They stayed like that until Agatha rolled off again and pressed herself into Rio’s side.</p><p>They were both still for a while, with Rio drawing lazy patterns along Agatha’s arm as it lay wrapped around her waist but soon Agatha was pulling her over again, making her lay flush against her and pulling her leg up over her hip once more.</p><p>“Go to sleep,” she whispered quietly, brushing their lips in a barely there kiss.</p><p>“I’ll wake you in the morning.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, and made sure to kiss Agatha properly before she settled down again, their noses just a breath away as the gentle feel of Agatha’s hand caressing her thigh helped her to drift off.</p><p>Rio woke in the same position she’d fallen asleep in, only the duvet had been pulled down to allow them to breathe properly and Agatha was now pressing soft kisses to her face, “Rio, honey. I’m sorry. You need to wake up.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, the daze between sleeping and waking making her forget that her heart had been pulverised and glued back together the night before.</p><p>And all she felt was Agatha against her, her hand still warm and firm against her thigh, her lips still soft and gentle against her skin.</p><p>“Baby,” she whispered again, “you need to get up.”</p><p>Rio groaned once more and reluctantly opened her eyes to see tired blue staring back at her. She raised her fingers up to touch Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Did you sleep?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and only rolled them over slowly to hover above Rio, this time not pressing down and against her.</p><p>Rio protested this by tugging at her weakly, her limbs not yet back to their full strength.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“You need to get up.”</p><p>“Kiss me once and I’ll go.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as she waited for it and it took longer than she thought it might but soon the welcome feel of Agatha’s lips encircling her own was back and she hummed happily into it, feeling warmed from the inside out.</p><p>Agatha broke it after too short a time and Rio frowned where she was already pulling away and moving to fetch Rio’s discarded pants.</p><p>“That wasn’t the kind of kiss I was hoping for.”</p><p>“If I kiss you any longer I-…”</p><p>But Agatha was holding out her pants to her and Rio caught her eye and saw again that familiar reluctance to let her in.</p><p>So she turned away and slipped her jeans back on, running her hands through her bed head before daring to turn back to watch as Agatha quietly opened the door and slipped through to the main living area.</p><p>Rio followed silently and went to grab her discarded shoes and jacket and bag and went with Agatha to the door.</p><p>They hovered there, both standing silently in their uncertainty, both keeping hold of things unsaid.</p><p>“Have a safe flight,” Agatha eventually whispered, not quite meeting Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio reached for Agatha’s left hand and turned it over to kiss her ring finger purposefully, holding it against her lips in the exact spot where her ring should be. She then pressed her face against the back of her hand and breathed her in for a second before she turned to leave and stepped from Agatha’s shared suite with Nicky into the long hallway and back to her suite to pack her things and fly back to Toronto.</p>

I believe in our gal</p><p>@RiHag: Heard from a friend Rio referred to the kid as her own? Anyone else hear that? #DaddyVidal</p><p>@RiCnt: both. same time. raw. next question.</p></blockquote><p>It hadn’t been an easy couple of months.</p><p>But the first day had been the worst.</p><p>The news about Rio and Agatha attending a Celtics game together had broken not five minutes after they’d entered the stadium. There had been photos of them from every conceivable angle, in every imaginable pose, moment, and emotion.</p><p>Particular attention had been picked up online by Rio’s fans that she looked like Agatha’s son and imaginations had run wild as to why that was and questions as to how no one had noticed it before were plastered over gossip sites and Twitter timelines the world over.</p><p>And then there had been Alice.</p><p>Alice had blown up Rio’s phone two minutes after she’d arrived at the stadium.</p><p>Only Rio hadn’t even looked at her phone until she was on the way to the airport.</p><p>So Alice was furious.</p><p>They’d spent a week in a deeply unpleasant space with each other.</p><p>Rio was depressed and morose anyway and Alice was incandescent with her friend.</p><p>Alice had only eventually given in and conceded that it was probably a good move - albeit a needlessly sneaky one - on Rio’s behalf to be photographed being friendly with Agatha and her son. And Rio had no energy or desire to do anything but accept her apology.</p><p>And so they were back to normal.</p><p>And Rio had to live with the fact that people on the internet wanted her to be with Agatha almost as much as she herself wanted it.</p><p>But she hadn’t heard from her. It had been weeks and the last she’d seen of Agatha was her standing in the door to her suite wearing the jersey she’d had made for her.</p><p>The last she’d felt of her touch was when she’d held her hand to her face.</p><p>The last thing she’d heard her say to her was to ‘have a safe flight’.</p><p>And then radio silence.</p><p>She knew, when she could stand to tune into updates from Alice about Jen and Agatha, that she’d fallen out with Jennifer. She knew that they still weren’t on great terms and that Ralph had taken the whole thing badly too.</p><p>But she didn’t know anything else.</p><p>The only other news of Agatha came from the announcements of the Critics Choice Award nominations, followed swiftly by the Golden Globes. They both got nominations. And were both favourites to win.</p><p>Which meant only one thing to Rio: she’d be seeing Agatha in early January.</p><p>With two of the top five awards bodies already teeing both Rio and Agatha up to be potential winners, all talk had turned to which of them would top the other.</p><p>Which, ironically, was a lot of the chat about the two of them online as well.</p><p>But Rio had done all she could. She’d been as honest as Agatha had allowed her to be. And Agatha hadn’t reached back out, so Rio lived now in a liminal space: a space between loving Agatha and needing to move on.</p><p>But she’d promised to wait.</p><p>And so she began to resent that she had even decided to be in a movie that was awards fodder, let alone turn in a stellar performance in it. She began to hate herself for her aspirations, for wanting to be as good and as well respected as Agatha, because it had forced them together, it had meant that she’d fallen for her.</p><p>Fallen so hard and so painfully that she’d been celibate since Boston.</p><p>She’d taken to lying to Alice about the women she <em>wasn’t</em> sleeping with. Saying she was trying harder to date rather than to just shag. And Alice was pleased she was being more discerning. So she made up girls she’d matched with on Raya, and she flirted in front of her so she wouldn’t suspect that she’d lost her mind over a married mother.</p><p>And by late December she was beginning to feel a little more herself.</p><p>She’d acted her way into a better place.</p><p>She’d wrapped filming on her Toronto project and was back home for the holidays.</p><p>And her parents were staying with her, which was a blessing and a curse. It meant she got no alone time but also meant she had a full fridge and an even fuller stomach.</p><p>Her final piece of work was scheduled in for the day before Christmas Eve and much to her parents confusion it was reading thirst tweets for Buzzfeed.</p><p>“I can’t believe you told them what this was,” Rio was saying as her blusher was topped up and an anxious Alice was shuffling in front of her.</p><p>“It slipped out, okay? I’m not sure they understood anyway.”</p><p>“Yeah, telling them people on the internet were writing dirty stuff about their daughter wasn’t exactly the Christmas present I was hoping you’d get them.”</p><p>“Actually I got your mom a nice scarf and your dad some whiskey. This was just a treat.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and swung for Alice, narrowly missing her shoulder as she stepped back.</p><p>“No hitting. I didn’t bring a change of outfit and I don’t want your grubby paws ruining my shirt before my flight.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again but said nothing more, knowing Alice was anxious enough as it was because as soon as this shoot was done she was hopping a flight to Indianapolis to spend Christmas with Jen’s family.</p><p>“Relax,” she said as the makeup artist moved away and one of the producers was making his way over. “They’ll love you.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, everyone loves you.”</p><p>Rio grinned widely to hide the twinge of sadness that told her she could name one person who didn’t.</p><p>But grinning helped. It almost felt real.</p><p>“Rio! Are you ready? Not vetting these first is crazy, by the way. We’ve thrown in some absolute zingers.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Alice began to chew on her lip.</p><p>“Maybe we should have.”</p><p>“C’mon. We see loads all the time. You’re constantly reading them out to me and laughing about them.”</p><p>Alice hummed her disapproval and Rio sighed as she turned back to the producer and took the phone offered to her.</p><p>“Swiping right through them?”</p><p>“Yeah. Tried to put them in a random order so some will be more tame than others. We’ll just point and shoot and edit out any that make you want to vomit.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ve a strong stomach.”</p><p>Rio was left alone then, perched on a small director’s chair in the middle of a blank backdrop, and she watched as everyone took their seats behind the camera and Alice’s smile returned to her face once she saw how Rio looked on the monitor.</p><p>She took it as a sign that she looked good.</p><p>“Ready when you are, Rio!”</p><p>Rio nodded and held her phone up to swipe up and read the first screenshot of a tweet.</p><p>She laughed. Genuinely. Loudly. And then looked to the camera with a raised brow.</p><p>“Hi I’m Rio Vidal and I’m here today with Buzzfeed to read thirst tweets.”</p><p>She dropped her gaze to the phone again and clicked her tongue. “God what a way to start.”</p><p>“@RidalsGal1 says: ‘I have two perfectly good holes and one needy mouth and none of them are full of @RioVidal. America please explain.’” Rio laughed again and looked at the camera.</p><p>“Jesus.”</p><p>She swiped the screen until the next tweet came up and whistled a low note as she read it over before voicing it: “@Darby789 says: ‘All I want for Christmas is for @RioVidal to use me as her personal’… oh my god,” she cleared her throat but her lips twitched into a crooked grin, partly for the camera and partly because she couldn’t believe what she was about to say: “‘use me as her personal cum bucket’.”</p><p>She ran a hand through her hair and looked up at the camera with raised brows, “Gimme a time and a place and I’ll be there.”</p><p>She heard Alice laugh and smirked as she looked to the next one: “@VidalsPlaything says @RioVidal I am free this Thursday for dinner and also anal thanks.’ Straight to the point. Like it.”</p><p>The next one she swiped to and laughed again, her tongue poking in her cheek as she chuckled and tried to get a grip on herself. “Jesus, man. You guys are <em>freaks</em>. Okay, @RioRioRio says: ‘Need @RioVidal biblically. Like, fist so far up my ass she’s wearing me like Kermit the Frog.’ <em>Dios mío!</em>”</p><p>She dropped the phone to her lap and looked back up to the camera, remembering the chat she’d had before with Alice and the producer; “make sure you comment briefly between each read”, “feel free to pause or laugh or whatever you need to do”, “try to react as naturally as possible”, “flirt, Rio. You’re excellent at it.”</p><p>“Listen, I’m pretty busy right now but I might have fisting time in the new year. I’ll keep you in mind.”</p><p>She looked back to the next one and smiled as she adjusted her free arm over her lap, “Okay this one is pretty sweet, actually. ‘@VidalsWife says ‘If I had one nickel for every time I’ve masturbated to thoughts of @RioVidal I’d be the richest woman in the world.’ Sweet. Romantic, even.”</p><p>She smirked at the camera and flicked to the next one.</p><p>“@Feral4Vidal says: ‘I love Rio Vidal’ and then it brackets it says… ‘I want Rio Vidal to rail me’.” She snickered and groaned as she grinned, “with all these requests I’m going to be a busy girl.”</p><p>And here is where she paused, when she swiped for her next tweet, and almost lost her composure. Because Agatha’s name was the first thing she saw.</p><p>“@HarknessHymen: ‘Feeling v French today. @RioVidal and #AgathaHarkness how would you feel about recreating the Eiffel Tower with me to celebrate?’” She forced a laugh, forced her smile to remain on her face. “I’ll text her later. Thanks for asking so politely.”</p><p>“Man, oh man, you people. I hope you don’t kiss your mothers with these mouths.”</p><p>She cleared her throat and shifted in her seat, beginning to toy with her hair as she read the next: “From @GayDream13 says ‘Sometimes Rio Vidal is so mommy and sometimes she’s so daddy I don’t know whether I want to suckle or suck.’” She laughed and took herself by surprise at it, blushing ever so slightly as she rocked her head back and grinned. “Christ.”</p><p>“Honestly this is the weirdest ego boost I’ve ever had.”</p><p>“@RiosToothGap says… oh god. They say: ‘I hope Rio knows she has an army of women willing to crawl miles over broken glass just to beg her to spit on them’.”</p><p>“I mean… how many miles, guys? Be specific please. Details.”</p><p>She looked up with a grin and saw Alice indicate one more and so she looked down to the next tweet on offer. And Agatha’s name was there again.</p><p>She cleared her throat quietly and read it over properly, feeling her jaw clench as each passing word made her feel increasingly more uncomfortable.</p><p><em>@Whre4Rio: I wouldn’t even want to join. I just want to live in a world where Rio Vidal knows what Agatha Harkness’s puss tastes like.</em></p><p>The recent flurry of internet interest in Agatha and Rio’s relationship that caught the attention of almost every journalist worth their salt. So Buzzfeed were clearly no different.</p><p>Most had focused on the rivals turned friends angle and some industry-focused journos had been deliberating and debating over whether this was a clever PR stunt for more attention, for more votes.</p><p>But Alice had told Rio that her Twitter was full of tweets like these and Rio was able to laugh most of them off, to roll her eyes and smile as Alice read them out, but sometimes they hit that little soft part of herself that wanted to cry instead of laugh.</p><p>She stared at it for a while and in her peripheral vision saw Alice moving a little as if to come to her. But she looked up before she could and shook her head slightly, “I’m sorry. Not this one. Can we cut that out and I’ll read one more.”</p><p>“Sure sure,” came the voice of the producer, keen to make sure Rio could continue comfortably and not ruin what he and his colleagues knew would be a huge hit for them on their YouTube channel. “Whatever you want. Start from the top on the next one.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and swiped to get the next tweet up. She scanned it over and then looked to the camera with her smile back in place, “Everyone seems to think I wanna hurt people but I promise I’m actually every nice.”</p><p>She looked back at the tweet and read: “@D1ckD4re says ‘Rio Vidal could run me over, spit on my mangled body, and burn me to ash and I’d come back and thank her for it.’ I mean… I don’t want to do that but if you really want it then I guess who am I to say no?”</p><p>She laughed at her little joke, hamming it up for the camera to make up for her refusal to read the last tweet and then she dropped the phone and smiled, “Am I done humiliating myself now? Is everybody satisfied or would anyone like me to provide my services as a puppeteer?”</p><p>She held her hand up with a grin and wriggled her fingers, much to the delight of the video producers who now had their perfect end to an expertly performed video.</p><p>“We got it!” The main producer shouted and Rio raised her brows as Alice rushed in.</p><p>“You did? Need me to repeat or-…?”</p><p>“No, honest, Rio. You gave us everything we needed.”</p><p>Rio smiled and held the phone back out as she stood from her seat, “They were… Jesus.”</p><p>“Told you.”</p><p>“Hey. Amazing. Which did you skip?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio shrugged and was grateful the phone was gone so Alice couldn’t make her show the tweet in question.</p><p>“Just one about… just felt a bit weird.”</p><p>“Okay. Well you fucking nailed it.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>“Must be all that sex you’ve not been having lately.”</p><p>Rio only hummed at Alice’s whispered words and moved with her to begin making the rounds, thanking everyone and saying their goodbyes and merry christmases as they finally, after a long day, left the little studio.</p><p>Outside by Rio’s old hybrid is where Alice pulled her best friend down into a tight hug.</p><p>“I’ll miss you.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and held Alice tightly against herself, turning her head after a few seconds to kiss her cheek.</p><p>“It’s just a few days.”</p><p>“Say it back, you bitch.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pulled away, “I’ll miss you too.”</p><p>Alice hummed and went to remove her bags from the back of Rio’s car, “You make sure your mom leaves me plenty of food, okay? Jen’s promised an anti inflammatory menu and… I think by the time I’m back I’ll be craving anything <em>other</em> than whatever that means.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, it’s practically a production factory in my poor little kitchen. I’ll try not to eat it all.”</p><p>“Very much appreciated,” Alice grinned as she shouldered her duffel and slammed the door shut.</p><p>Her expression softened as she took Rio in and Rio just knew she was about to ask her the same question she’d been asking her since she got back from Boston: “Anything you want to talk to me about?”</p><p>Rio knew she’d not kept her low moods hidden particularly well but she couldn’t reveal the truth for fear of outing Agatha so secrecy was important. It was paramount.</p><p>“No. Go and have a great time with your beautiful girlfriend and call me every day, okay?”</p><p>“Okay. I love you, idiot. Behave. Don’t run off on anymore trips that make my girlfriend furious.”</p><p>“Noted. I love you too.”</p><p>Rio left Alice to walk off towards the uber that had just arrived to take her to the airport and she felt her body shrink in on itself a little, feeling at ease now she was alone and had no secrets to keep.</p><p>The drive back to her home took less than an hour and she found herself singing along to random Christmas songs played by the local radio station.</p><p>They were cheesy but they were better than sitting in silence with her thoughts or scrolling through her podcast app trying to find something she could be bothered to focus on.</p><p>She slammed the car door shut and made her way into her home, the smell of fresh cooking filling her lungs as she closed the door behind her.</p><p>“¡Hola! Mamá, papá!”</p><p>A bag on the console table by the door caught her eye but she ignored it, assuming it was an old tote bag of hers and perhaps her mom had used it to go pick up some last minute groceries.</p><p>But what really surprised her was that no one had shouted back.</p><p>She dropped her keys into the little bowl on the side and slowly moved through the house, looking this way and that until her last resort was to head out to the back to see if they’d taken themselves out to enjoy wait remained of the December sun.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows when she came round the side of the house and saw her parents sitting on the little bench with two chairs she recognised from her dining room sitting opposite them and a blanket stolen from her bed lying on the floor before them with the remnants of what looked like a picnic.</p><p>“¿Qué pasó?”</p><p>Anna Vidal looked up with a wide smile where she sat beside her husband, cradling one of Rio’s large mugs in her hands.</p><p>“We had guests.”</p><p>“Guests?”</p><p>“Invitadas,” her dad confirmed with a wink.</p><p>Rio raised her brows as she surveyed the evidence of these guests. She sat in one of the seats as her mom offered an explanation.</p><p>“Your friend arrived with gifts an hour after you left with Alice.”</p><p>“Amiga bonita,” her dad added unhelpfully but Rio shot him a small smile, wracking her brains for who was in town and who might stop by the day before Christmas Eve.</p><p>Wanda?</p><p>“She had gifts and her son wanted to see you.”</p><p><em>Agatha.</em></p><p>“Mom, was it Agatha?”</p><p>Rio’s heart rate went through the roof and she wondered how long it would be before her Apple Watch buzzed and told her she was working out.</p><p>But her mom seemed to not notice and was taking a sip of tea before responding.</p><p>“Sí, sí, Agatha y Nicky.”</p><p>If Rio hadn’t been sitting she might have fainted.</p><p>“They…”</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the remnants of the picnic and she saw suddenly the telltale signs of a demolished plate of tostones along with guac and a bowl that definitely at some point earlier had had ice cream in it.</p><p>“You need to buy some furniture.”</p><p>“<em>Mamá</em>,” Rio insisted suddenly, keen to find out everything about how and why Agatha and Nicky had been in her house with her parents when she’d had no knowledge that they were even coming.</p><p>“How long did they stay?”</p><p>“¡Bah!” Anna exclaimed with a laugh and a wave of her hand, “Long enough to teach the little one how to make tostones and for your papá to bore Agatha to death with tales of your childhood.”</p><p>Rio felt sick again.</p><p>“Dad,” she said and turned to see her dad smiling at her and had to look away for fear she’d relent instead of remaining firm in her quest for details.</p><p>“So? What? Hours?”</p><p>“Sí.”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and cleared her throat.</p><p>“What’s wrong, mija? I’m sure if you called you could-…”</p><p>“How was she? Was she…?”</p><p>“Encantadora, educada, nerviosa.” <em>Charming, polite, nervous.</em></p><p>“Nervous?”</p><p>“Ella se calmó.” <em>She calmed down.</em></p><p>Rio nodded slowly and felt her father’s eyes on her even as she focused in on her mom.</p><p>“And Nicky?”</p><p>Anna looked to her husband and then turned back to Rio slowly, a small frown appearing on her face, “Él tiene tu cara.” <em>He has your face.</em></p><p>“I know,” Rio said in a much softer tone than before.</p><p>“Was he okay?”</p><p>“Shy. He was looking for you.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, and took a second to process all this before she spoke again, “Did you like them?”</p><p>“Very much.”</p><p>“¿Quién no lo haría?” <em>Who wouldn’t?</em></p><p>Rio smiled a little and dropped her gaze to a lone breadstick in a cup and took it.</p><p>“You’ll spoil dinner.”</p><p>“I’m starving.”</p><p>Really she just wanted something to do.</p><p>Anna hummed and Rio smiled as she took a big bite.</p><p>“You don’t want to look at your gifts?”</p><p>She almost choked.</p><p>“Gifts?” She spluttered, her dad moving to come around and smack her back to help.</p><p>“Gracias,” she mumbled as she cleared her throat loudly, “What g-…?”</p><p>But her mom had said Agatha had brought gifts and she almost choked again but this time on nothing. She stood and looked at her dad who was smiling warmly at her with raised brows and she caught something in his eye that told her everything she needed to know about what Miguel Vidal had guessed already.</p><p>“They’re under the tree,” her mom said with a wave of her hand and Rio nodded, turning back to shoot her a smile before she disappeared inside, moving so fast she was practically jogging.</p><p>Once back inside Rio took a deep breath and placed her hand over her heart to feel it thrumming it’s thumping rhythm against her ribcage.</p><p>Weeks and weeks of nothing and then this. Showing up to her house with gifts, with Nicky. Staying and chatting with her dad. Her mom taking the time to teach Nicky how to cook.</p><p>It didn’t make sense.</p><p>She moved to the tree and crouched beside it, immediately knowing the gifts that must be from Agatha.</p><p>Since childhood she’d had a bad habit of feeling and shaking her gifts, ripping them just enough to be able to see what she had before Christmas morning.</p><p>It was a habit her parents tried to shake her out of but one she’d never truly beaten.</p><p>And each gift dotted around the foot of the tree had small rips in them, evidence of Rio’s impatience.</p><p>Only two gifts at the front looked untouched.</p><p>And both had cards leaning against them.</p><p>Under no circumstances did Rio think she could wait two days to find out what they were so she picked the first card up and recognised immediately the handwriting of a seven year old.</p><p>Her name was written in large, wobbling letters and there was a small sticker of Santa in the corner that smiled dispassionately up at her.</p><p>She smiled back at it and then turned it over to open it.</p><p>Inside was a slim photograph rather than the card she was expecting.</p><p>She pulled it out front first and saw that it was the picture Agatha had taken of her and Nicky; the one where their caps were backwards and Nicky was grinning up at Rio who grinned back down at him.</p><p>It was shocking, really, how long it had taken Rio to see the resemblance. But it was there. As bright and obvious as the smiles on their faces.</p><p>She turned it over and with a pang saw that Nicky had written her a message and Rio hadn’t thought to send anything to him.</p><p><em>Dear Rio, wishing you a very happy Christmas and a happy new year. Go Celtics! Love, Nicky.</em></p><p>She saw beneath the boy’s wobbly handwriting the faint pencil marks that must have been Agatha’s, guiding her son’s message.</p><p>Turning it back over to see their smiling faces again she had to swallow down the guilt she felt that not only had Nicky written to her, he’d wanted to see her.</p><p>And she’d not sent him anything.</p><p>She placed the card aside and took up the gift she assumed was from him, unwrapping it uncharacteristically gingerly until she held a brand new Celtics scarf in her hands.</p><p>She laughed as she draped it around her neck and turned then to the next card.</p><p>God she hoped there wasn’t a photo of Agatha in there.</p><p>She wasn’t sure she could handle seeing that right now.</p><p>She opened it blindly, having closed her eyes as she did so. Her fingers felt along the edges until she found it to be a card and she blinked down at the image that looked back at her.</p><p>The illustration was of a colourful little bay, drawn by an artist to represent Positano.</p><p>It was almost worse than an image of Agatha.</p><p>She opened it to see loopy handwriting, much neater than her son’s.</p><p><em>Rio, Merry Christmas. You once told Nicky the color green was lucky. I hope this has some luck in it too. Agatha.</em></p><p>Rio frowned at the message, her forefinger tracing the loops of Agatha’s signature and feeling the soft indent of her pen there.</p><p>Any remnant of Agatha was now precious.</p><p>She put the card aside to pick up the gift that had been left beneath it and opened that in the same way she had Nicky’s.</p><p>Inside the neat wrappings was a box with the initials HW on the front.</p><p><em>Harry Winston.</em></p><p>Rio hesitated before she opened it, knowing that whatever was inside would be beautiful and expensive.</p><p>And it was.</p><p>Sitting on a deep navy cushion was a gold pendant necklace, with a perfectly round emerald encased by a gold setting. It was delicate and Rio touched it equally delicately, wondering when Agatha had decided she’d buy her a gift, wondering when she’d decided she’d buy her <em>this</em> gift.</p><p>“Rio! You bad child,” came her mom’s voice from the other end of the room, “You cannot open gifts now!”</p><p>Rio barely reacted and chewed on her lip as she closed the little box and picked up the cards and the wrappings.</p><p>“I need to shower and then I’ll be down for dinner, okay?”</p><p>Her mom just waved a hand in dismissal and Rio disappeared up the stairs with her treasures, depositing the discarded wrappings in the trash as she went.</p><p>When in her room she jumped on her bed and lay out her gifts before her like a collector admiring her latest finds.</p><p>She stared at each one in turn, wondering why it hadn’t crossed her mind to even send a card. To at least buy Nicky something.</p><p>But then, she supposed, never in a million years had she assumed Agatha would give her a gift.</p><p>She pulled her phone out and ignored the texts and calls that filled her home screen and found Agatha’s contact in WhatsApp.</p><p>7:14pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I didn’t get the memo about exchanging gifts.</p><p>Simple. Casual. Letting Agatha know she knew she should have sent something.</p><p>She placed her phone down just as the response came through.</p><p>7:15pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: A strange way to say thank you.</p><p>7:16pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I should be saying sorry. I hear you spent the afternoon with my parents</p><p>7:16pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: They were great.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip, her thumbs doing their familiar dance over the keypad as she leant over her phone.</p><p>7:19pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can you tell Nicky I’m sorry I missed him?</p><p>7:22pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I will.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t giving much. But this was the first she’d heard from Agatha in weeks and she wasn’t willing to let it go so easily.</p><p>The lightweight metal of her battered iPhone felt suddenly heavy in her hands, suddenly precious because it was full of Agatha.</p><p>Casting aside her fear that Agatha might not even respond, she pressed on:</p><p>7:23pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Why would I need luck?</p><p>7:24pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Your mom warned me you might open your gifts.</p><p>7:24pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: It’s beautiful</p><p>7:25pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: The scarf or the necklace?</p><p>7:26pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Both. Can I call you?</p><p>7:26pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: My mother and in-laws are here.</p><p>7:27pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’ll see you at the CCAs?</p><p>7:27pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Yes.</p><p>7:28pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Te veo</p><p>Rio put her phone down after that. Her gaze falling to the Harry Winston box and the image of Positano next to it.</p><p>She longed to be alone with Agatha again. Even if she couldn’t touch her. Just to see how she was. Just to know she was okay.</p><p>If she’d been nervous when she’d arrived earlier that day then that had to mean something. It had to mean she didn’t know how Rio would have received her.</p><p>It had to mean she cared.</p><p>Or she wouldn’t have brought her son. Wouldn’t have helped him write her card. Wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of picking theIr picture and getting it printed so Rio could keep it.</p><p>Wouldn’t have chosen Rio a necklace.</p><p>Rio spent the rest of the evening in a slight daze but tried her hardest to get more information out of her parents.</p><p>What she got was limited.</p><p>Yes: Agatha had spoken Spanish to them the whole time she was there.</p><p>Yes: her accent was good, yes she could teach Rio a thing or two about grammar.</p><p>Yes: Nicky had spoken a little in Spanish and where he couldn’t respond he’d used English.</p><p>Yes: he’d been shy all day.</p><p>Yes: every time the wind blew a certain way he’d turned to see if Rio had arrived home.</p><p>Yes: Agatha had taken Nicky away whilst Ralph entertained his parents and her mom.</p><p>No: she didn’t say much about it.</p><p>No: she hadn’t seemed bored or annoyed by her dad’s stories.</p><p>No: she didn’t try to leave quickly.</p><p>Yes: she’d asked how Rio had been.</p><p>It was flashes of an afternoon, delivered in rapid Spanish from her mother who was more interested in telling her about the family’s drama.</p><p>But it was all Rio had.</p><p>Agatha had told her she needed some time and Rio was giving her that. But she didn’t know how much time she had left in her.</p><p>But time moved still and before she could blink it was Christmas.</p><p>And Christmas Day was a soft day. A day where she could be in her pyjamas. A day where she’d felt emboldened by two mimosas with breakfast to send a photo to Agatha that went unanswered until the early evening.</p><p>She’d put her new necklace on even as she still wore her ratty old University of Delaware t-shirt and thrown the scarf artfully over herself too.</p><p>And she’s smiled like she might have done if the gifts had been handed to her personally by the people who’d bought them for her.</p><p>And in the soft lightning of her bedroom she’d sent the selfie; makeup free, and hopeful.</p><p>The response came much much later than she’d hoped it would.</p><p>9:13pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Green is your color.</p><p>Rio had been doom scrolling when the message came through, laid out on the sofa with a hoodie on over the pyjamas she’d been in all day. Her stomach was full and her wine glass was tragically empty but she could neither be bothered to refill it or bring herself to ask her mom watching <em>Love Actually</em> or rouse her sleeping dad in the armchair to get it for her.</p><p>Plenty of messages had been streaming through all day but this was the first she clicked into.</p><p>9:15pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: How has your day been?</p><p>9:17pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Fine. Yours?</p><p>9:17pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Quiet</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip as she waited for a reply but minutes went by and nothing and so she pulled her hood up and sulked silently about it, wondering if she should have been more witty or asked another question.</p><p>At the top of her spiral another text came through:</p><p>9:33pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: What’re you doing?</p><p>9:33pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I’m on the couch. Mom’s watching Love Actually</p><p>9:35pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Maybe next year she’ll be watching your Christmas movie.</p><p>Rio frowned at this message, unsure what Agatha was referring to until her wine-slowed brain kicked into gear again.</p><p>9:38pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can’t believe you passed on it</p><p>9:40pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I have taste.</p><p>Rio smirked at her phone and danced her thumbs for a bit before she tapped back:</p><p>9:41pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: In necklaces, in women</p><p>The risk hadn’t paid off.</p><p>Agatha didn’t text back.</p><p>Rio sulked more and eventually took herself off to bed by ten thirty.</p><p>By the time Alice was back and the new year was celebrated with her parents leaving the day before, and with a messy, loud, house party to ring in the bells, Rio had blocked out her last, regrettable text to Agatha.</p><p>She’d been drunk out of her mind entering the new year and had just one more day of freedom before she had to get back to work with press events and fittings for the Critics Choice Awards on the 4th January.</p><p>And despite her reputation, Rio had remained true to her word.</p><p>She’d kept her hands and her lips to herself during her party.</p><p>She even kept her tongue in her mouth whenever Agatha was mentioned and as drunk as she was she gave nothing away and only nodded and smiled when people mentioned her name to her.</p><p>The picture of her and Nicky sat hidden in her bathroom cabinet and her precious new necklace sat on her vanity.</p><p>But her mind, her heart, they were full of Agatha all the time. Full of the prospect of seeing her in three days, full of the idea that she might be able to hold her hand, if only secretly, and for a few stolen moments.</p><p>And maybe it was the start of the new year. Maybe it was that she’d rung it in surrounded by friends. But she felt hopeful for the first time in a while.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Rio!”</p><p>The cacophony of noise in the glittering ballroom born within the depths of a sweeping historic airplane hangar meant that Rio didn’t hear her name being called over and over.</p><p>She was instead in deep conversation with the man next to her, a very boring man with a thick moustache that reminded Rio of a sweaty walrus. Unfortunately for her, she’d been seated next to him for the last twenty minutes.</p><p>The walrus just so happened to be head of the studio that was spending millions to try to get her the Oscar.</p><p>Which meant that Rio had to keep her marine-themed jokes to a minimum.</p><p>“I really think you should reconsider this latest activism, you know. Got to be friends on both sides.”</p><p>“I’m not sure being gay really counts as activism,” Rio said with just a hint of amusement in her voice and a smile that widened when the moustache quivered with a shake of the man’s head.</p><p>“Don’t mistake me, I merely mean-…”</p><p>“Rio, my god.”</p><p>Rio felt a hand on the side of her head and one on her shoulder and a pair of lips pressed against her temple to be quickly replaced by a thumb brushing away the lipstick left there.</p><p>“Sorry,” Wanda whispered quietly as Rio turned to her with a grin, her hand finding the one still on her shoulder.</p><p>“Wanda, you know Nick Craine?”</p><p>Rio squeezed and released Wanda’s hand as the moustache with legs stood and pressed his bristly face into Wanda’s cheek.</p><p>Rio had to turn and sip her wine to hide her laugh.</p><p>“Pleasure as always, Wanda. I’ve been selfishly keeping poor Rio to myself. I’ll leave you ladies to it. But perhaps… before I go… a photo op, on your right.”</p><p>Rio turned just as Craine pointed to a photographer snapping his way through the crowds and she smiled as she stood to position herself next to one of the reasons she was getting so much attention this season.</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her and Rio had to fight hard not to recoil from the sweaty palm that hit her bare skin of her upper back.</p><p>She felt Wanda squeeze her arm as it rested across the broad back of the exec between them and she bit the inside of her cheek even as she grinned at the man memorialising the moment with his camera.</p><p>The moment was soon captured and Rio rolled her shoulders back in an attempt to shake off the lingering feeling of clamminess against her back as the head of the studio went off to schmooze more unwilling actors.</p><p>“Jesus, I always forget how-…”</p><p>But Rio was laughing already and turned to smack Wanda’s arm.</p><p>“Don’t. I spent twenty minutes with him.”</p><p>“Hmm, and where is your guard dog?”</p><p>“Oh Alice is off trying to talk a casting director into getting me into a Star Wars.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes affectionately and Rio turned to take her glass back up, missing Wanda’s next question: “Who dressed you today?”</p><p>She missed it because across the room, far enough away that she could almost be a mirage, Rio saw Agatha for the first time since Boston.</p><p>There she stood sandwiched between two men in suits, looking far more beautiful than Rio remembered but a hand on her arm pulled her away from the vision before her and she raised her brows at a curious Wanda.</p><p>“Hey, too much wine already?”</p><p>“No, just…” Rio ran a hand through her hair then remembered she’d promised her hairstylist she wouldn’t do that. “What were you saying?”</p><p>“Who styled you? It’s good. Colour’s crazy good.”</p><p>Rio smiled and brushed down the satin of her midnight blue gown, “Jerome. Didn’t you use him last year for this?”</p><p>Wanda frowned a little in thought and Rio took the opportunity to turn back to glance at Agatha again.</p><p>Only she timed it wrong.</p><p>Agatha was laughing, a great big movie star laugh.</p><p>Her hand fell to the chest of the man beside her.  And Rio saw two things at once: Ralph, and a huge diamond ring on her left ring finger.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda nudged Rio again, following her line of sight to where Rio was still staring, “God she looks good.”</p><p>Rio could only hum in response, watching as Agatha dazzled across at whoever she and Ralph were talking to, her hand still on Ralph’s chest, her ring as bright as her smile.</p><p>She turned away and focused back in on Wanda who had taken a glass from a nearby tray.</p><p>“Think it’s hers? Or have you written your speech?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and made to touch her hair again but pulled her hand back when she remembered her promise from earlier. “Alice wrote down a few names but… it’s hers.”</p><p>“Sure as hell isn’t mine,” Wanda said with a wry smile.</p><p>“Oh so modest,” Rio teased, taking the opportunity to take another glance at the happily married couple across the room.</p><p>Agatha was glowing.</p><p>Maybe it was the wide grin across her features, maybe the shimmer of whatever body makeup someone had applied to her to make her <em>literally</em> glow, maybe it was that Rio had just missed her so much.</p><p>But she looked like magic.</p><p>“Stop staring, Rio. It’s not very cool.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little but just as she was about to turn back she saw Agatha’s gaze raise to meet her own.</p><p>The lights distorted, casting their star shine between them as Rio’s heart rate picked up and Agatha’s smile morphed from wide and bright to warm and genuine.</p><p>A hand on her arm turned her around again and the moment was gone. The lights were behaving once more and Rio was looking into Wanda’s soft features.</p><p>“She’s beautiful. And her husband is too.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips a little but softened when Wanda squeezed her arm with a kind smile, “Come on. We should make the rounds before any marine mammals find us again.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and followed behind Wanda into the crowds and soon found that they were stopped by acquaintances and admirers and Rio had no choice but to forget Agatha and her husband and focus back in on being the woman everyone expected her to be tonight: a grateful nominee, a delighted actress.</p><p>And she played the role well.</p><p>Thoughts of Agatha dissolved by the time Rio was five minutes into a very boring discussion about the layout of the space around them and she began to fidget on the spot.</p><p>Her fingers curled around the soft satin of her dress and she’d just made eyes at Alice across the room in a “help me” way when she felt a hand on her hip.</p><p>A press of a body just against her back.</p><p>Warm and familiar, her lungs filled with the scent of Agatha as she pressed around her, arriving at her side with her arm still flung around her as if they hadn’t been apart for weeks.</p><p>As if Rio hadn’t been yearning all this time.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out as she pressed their cheeks together in a not quite kiss, her hand curling tighter around Rio’s hip until she was bunching the fabric slightly in her hand.</p><p>And Rio turned into her, because how could she not.</p><p>She raised her hand without thinking and grazed the underside of Agatha’s jaw with her fingertips and watched as blue eyes flashed at her and then softened.</p><p>“Rio, you’re looking lovely.”</p><p>Ralph.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her dropped and Rio turned to the third person in what would be her absolute nightmare threesome scenario.</p><p>Ralph’s jaw was tight which only made him look more handsome and Rio stretched her head up to allow for the man to kiss away the lingering feel of where her cheek had just touched Agatha’s.</p><p>“Hi, Ralph.”</p><p>She straightened herself out again, and had enough sense left to introduce the man who’d grabbed her whilst she’d been making the rounds with Wanda.</p><p>Wanda had left her with an apologetic smile and she’d been stuck ever since.</p><p>The man honed in on Agatha immediately, because of course he did. And Ralph received a cursory handshake before Agatha was drawn into a conversation and Rio was left standing on the outside with Ralph hovering by her shoulder.</p><p>Tom Ford’s Oud Wood filled her lungs as she turned to him and she forced a smile to her face.</p><p>“Good Christmas?”</p><p>“Oh, you know how it is,” Ralph said with a very fake smile. He wasn’t as good an actor as his wife. “Nicky gets most of the attention and then the day’s done.”</p><p>If the universe weren’t so cruel, Rio wouldn’t have felt two things at once: the visceral need to pummel this man into oblivion and the gentle brush of knuckles against her own.</p><p>Forcing a nod and a laugh she tried again, “Well, he is the kid. Any good Celtics merch?”</p><p>“No, I’ve decided we’re going to be a Bulls family. I got him a season ticket. Paid it off for the next ten years so we’ll always have something to do together.”</p><p>This, Rio knew, was a reaction to the Boston trip.</p><p>A retaliation.</p><p>Only the only person who would be truly impacted by this was Nicky and she felt her jaw tighten and the hand that held her wine glass flex, suddenly imagining the stem was Ralph’s thick neck.</p><p>“Honey,” came Agatha’s voice from beside her.</p><p>And Rio turned because <em>she</em> was honey. But Agatha’s gaze was up on Ralph.</p><p>“We should take our seats. They’ll be starting soon.”</p><p>Oh but Rio hadn’t missed <em>this</em>. This torture of seeing Agatha with Ralph, of everyone else seeing it too, and of Rio just being some actress Agatha had once gone to a ball game with.</p><p>The only thing that anchored her spiralling thoughts was that she’d got to Ralph.</p><p>Her ‘friendship’ with Agatha seemed to threaten him and she would freely admit that she liked to see him struggle.</p><p>Only it meant Nicky suffered and <em>that</em> would never sit well with her.</p><p><em>That</em> was unforgivable.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Ralph nod, “I’ll fetch us drinks.”</p><p>And they were alone again, with Agatha having masterfully dislodged the limpet of a man who’d suckered onto Rio earlier.</p><p>“Is he okay?”</p><p>She had seconds, maybe, just enough time to try and calm her fury.</p><p>“He’s still mad about Boston, but-…”</p><p>“No, Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows briefly and then dropped her gaze from Rio, glancing around at where Ralph had disappeared to as the room began to swirl with people moving this way and that through the space seeking drinks and their seats.</p><p>“He’s fine.”</p><p>Time was against her so she couldn’t probe but she nodded and moved her gaze from Agatha’s perfectly defined jaw to her perfectly defined nose.</p><p>The makeup Agatha wore obscured the freckles Rio had once been close enough to count but Rio knew they were there. And that had to be enough.</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You look good,” Agatha said quietly, her knuckles brushing Rio’s again as Alice arrived on the little reunion, a bright smile in place.</p><p>“Agatha! Checking out the competition?”</p><p>And Rio dissolved back into her own mind again as Agatha and Alice made polite small talk, some of the intimacy in their relationship dissolved now since Agatha and Rio had gone rogue against their managers.</p><p>A pale hand was moving through the air, gesticulating with Agatha’s words and Rio zoned in on it, wondering why the left-handed Agatha was using her right whilst her left hung limply at her side.</p><p>She shifted to get a sight of it and saw what she’d seen from a distance earlier.</p><p>A wedding band. An engagement ring.</p><p>She’d never worn the latter in Rio’s presence before. At least, not when she’d been sober and not off her face in a Chicago bar bathroom.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said suddenly, cutting through the noise. “We should sit.”</p><p>Rio ran a hand through her hair and Agatha reached to fix it, her right hand just grazing her jaw as she placed her hair back to how a professional had spent hours arranging it earlier.</p><p>Their eyes locked and Rio wanted to kiss her.</p><p>But Alice had taken her hand and she was pulled away, back to the role she was playing that night, and back to her seat at her studio’s table.</p><p>As Rio slipped into place with Alice beside her she focused in on the soft conversation around her, sliding further and further from yearning as she did.</p><p>She knew Agatha would be close by at the next table.</p><p>They were favourites to win, meaning they were as close to the stage as they could get. And let’s face it, their respective studios would have paid to make sure their actresses didn’t need to walk a mile to pick up their gongs.</p><p>The lighting faded, the music kicked up, and in the dimmer room, Rio turned her head just slightly to see if Agatha were there. She saw nothing, no sign of her, until there she was.</p><p>Leaning back into view from where she’d been blocked by Ralph.</p><p>Agatha turned and they locked eyes and Rio saw her nod, caught her wink, and fell in love all over again.</p><p>But then her hand moved, and the light caught her diamond and Rio’s dark eyes fell to it and Agatha noticed, pulling her hand below the table even as Rio turned back around to focus on the night again.</p><p>She knew then why Agatha had been using her right hand earlier. She’d been hiding her ring from her.</p><p>A loud-mouthed, trying-his-best comedian appeared on stage to raucous applause and Rio politely joined in, settling herself in for a long night whilst her stomach churned with the nausea triggered by Agatha being so close and Ralph being right there with her.</p><p>By the fifth category a lot of the room was restless, and most people were disappearing now for comfort breaks or more drinks at the bar.</p><p>But Rio remained seated, remained sober, the only thing keeping her from zoning out completely was the occasional sound of Agatha’s laughter at the next table.</p><p>By category seven, she felt a hand brush her shoulder and turned to see Agatha walking away.</p><p>She took her in then, a black Bardot top over tailored black pants and stilettos that had made her just an inch or so taller than Rio.</p><p>She looked effortlessly glamorous and Rio could see all eyes turning to her as she passed by.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness was someone you looked at, looked twice at. She was someone who drew attention and made people feel weak at the knees.</p><p>So Rio knew she wasn’t alone as she stared.</p><p>But she was alone in her misery.</p><p>She turned back to tune in again, making sure her smile was up for when the camera got close and her posture was that other than ‘prawn’.</p><p>A waft of perfume told her Agatha was back in her seat and sure enough their category was about to be called.</p><p>The audience about them stilled, each member holding its breath for what was to be the first decider in the five-part tally of the most prestigious awards bodies culminating in the final Oscar.</p><p>Rio felt Alice’s hand slip to her thigh and she turned to shoot her a comforting smile and saw that her best friend looked more nervous than she’d ever seen before.</p><p>But names were being read out and she had no time for comforting as a camera swooped into her face and “Rio Vidal” was met with an eruption from her table and whoops and applause the room over.</p><p>And Rio turned to look at Agatha, seeing that she was looking up at the stage and was toying idly with her rings.</p><p>But Rio could only now see the angle of her jaw, the profile that she’d memorised long ago, long before they’d even met.</p><p>And her eyes, as she looked to them Agatha had turned to her as if she’d felt her gaze on her. And Rio hoped she had. She hoped she could pinpoint her in a crowded room, hoped of everyone’s admiring glances, she’d always look for Rio’s first.</p><p>The cameras began to move again and Rio had to look away, had to hold and pose for her closeup. But Agatha was in her periphery, her steady smile not the one she’d just been giving Rio.</p><p>And their faces were on the big screen.</p><p>Agatha was all Rio could see.</p><p>“And the Critics Choice Award for Best Actress goes to… Agatha Harkness for <em>No Heaven Like This</em>!”</p><p>And Rio turned to see the reaction happen live.</p><p>The din around her quieting to a murmur as Agatha stood from her seat and hands grasped her shoulders. Her husband kissed her cheek and Agatha kept her eyes on Rio.</p><p>And Rio beamed at her because she deserved it, because this award was always going to be hers.</p><p>She watched as Agatha released a breath, and then matched Rio’s smile and was suddenly turning, suddenly pulling from Ralph’s hold without acknowledging it and stepping up to the stage.</p><p>And Rio wished she could have been the one to properly congratulate her. To kiss her first. To squeeze her hand and feel a different ring on her finger.</p><p>She swooned, her body giving out as her mind was focused on the sight of Ralph’s hands on the woman who was not hers.</p><p>“My god,” Agatha was saying into the mic.</p><p>“This is… too much. My god.”</p><p>She laughed, a perfect, modest explosion of joy.</p><p>And Rio was guided back to her seat by gentle hands pulling her down where she’d been one of the last standing, watching the great Agatha Harkness accept her first proper award of the season.</p><p>“This category…”</p><p>The room erupted with cheers and Rio felt Alice squeeze her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha was beaming, so at ease in the spotlight and commanding the space as she held her head high and shook it, making her hair bounce and the glitter on her skin sparkle under the lights.</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath as Agatha met her gaze from the stage and her face softened even for a second as she took a breath.</p><p>“My son’s hero.”</p><p>Rio felt Alice’s hold on her shoulders tighten and her stomach flip as Agatha turned from her gaze to throw out the names of other nominees:</p><p>“Sylvia, Isla, Wanda…”</p><p>“I’m so honoured to be here tonight with you all.”</p><p>But Rio didn’t hear the rest of the speech because her ears were ringing with Agatha’s words and she couldn’t focus on anything else.</p><p>Agatha didn't linger on the stage long. Too professional and experienced to hover and splutter out more thanks.</p><p>“She didn’t thank Ralph,” Alice whispered into Rio’s ear, squeezing her shoulders as Rio watched Agatha stride form the stage.</p><p>“Or Jen,” she added as Rio turned to her and saw her frown.</p><p>“Where is Jen?”</p><p>Alice didn’t have a chance to answer because bodies were moving again in the brief pause between categories and Rio felt the familiar arm of a friend around her neck, “Hero, huh?”</p><p>“Shut it.”</p><p>Wanda laughed and crouched down between Rio and Alice, nudging Alice’s knee playfully, “What did you offer in exchange for that little shoutout?”</p><p>“Oh, Rio’s first born. And half her next paycheck.”</p><p>“A baby and ten dollars?” Wanda asked with a smile, “Agatha’s cheap.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t return after that. And Rio was able to focus properly because of it.</p><p>She celebrated enthusiastically when her writers won for best original screenplay and even cheered loudly when a director she’d worked with before won his award.</p><p>The ceremony drew to a close with a fizzle, rather than a bang.</p><p>The comedian’s last, lame joke was lost as chairs were scraped and glasses emptied as people began to mingle again, congratulating or commiserating or commenting on the night’s events.</p><p>And this time as Rio made the rounds, or more accurately, people made the rounds to her, Alice remained loyally at her side.</p><p>“No luck on the Star Wars front,” she managed to whisper in between well-wishers.</p><p>“I didn’t want that anyway,” Rio corrected with a smirk, poking her friend in the side just as a producer came over to chat.</p><p>It took an hour for Rio to extricate herself from the crowd, another ten minutes to move with Alice to the queue for cars lining up to take the attendees home.</p><p>Rio shivered in the cold and Alice shrugged her jacket off to drape over her client, smiling a little at the dramatic way Rio tugged it tighter around her.</p><p>“Such an actress.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes but said nothing, focused instead on the two people moving towards them.</p><p>Agatha was moving through the crowds like a queen returning triumphant from war. Everyone either moved out of her way or tried to stop her as she went.</p><p>But Rio saw that she was making a beeline for them and she couldn’t help but feel warmed more by that than the blazer currently wrapped around her.</p><p>“Is this where the losers stand?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes, refusing to give Agatha the satisfaction as she moved closer.</p><p>“Heroes, actually.”</p><p>Ralph scoffed but Rio ignored it and glanced at Agatha’s exposed arms, seeing the goosebumps that raised there.</p><p>If the last time Rio had slept with Agatha told her anything it was that where Rio ran typically warm, Agatha was always colder. Which meant she must be frozen.</p><p>“Here,” she offered quickly, shrugging Alice’s jacket off.</p><p>But Ralph had moved to block her and Rio saw Agatha disappear behind him to re-emerge with his suit jacket over her shoulders.</p><p>She looked away, Alice’s jacket back on, her jaw flexing slightly.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice interjected quickly, her eyes darting between Rio and the woman she addressed, “Congratulations, really. If anyone else deserves it other than Rio, it’s you.”</p><p>“Thanks, Alice.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her feet, praying the car would show soon, or hit her, either way.</p><p>“We should move on,” Ralph said importantly, and Rio looked up to see he was looking at his phone in an attempt to look just as important as he’d tried to sound.</p><p>But her inspection of him was cut short by an arm that snaked below her borrowed blazer and a pair of lips against her cheek. Agatha’s hold was tight but brief and by the time Rio had registered it, she’d gone.</p><p>“You’re still into her, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and felt her cheeks flush despite the cold night air, finding in Alice an understanding dawn.</p><p>“No. We’re friends.”</p><p>“I was watching you at the new year party. You kept pushing people away.”</p><p>“Can we talk about this in the car?”</p><p>Alice nodded and Rio looked down at her feet again, tugging the blazer over her shoulders closer around herself.</p><p>The car soon rolled around and interrupted the silence between the two best friends. Rio slipped in first and sighed into the leather as she waited for the questions to come.</p><p>“She’s married.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“She’s not interested.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and looked away, “I know.”</p><p>“You haven’t been looking for a girlfriend. You’ve been pining.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her knees, “It’s not pining, Alice. It’s-…”</p><p>Alice sighed and reached for Rio’s hand, “It’s stupid is what it is.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Look, I just don’t want to see you hurt and falling over yourself for Agatha Harkness...”</p><p>Rio pulled her hand away and petulantly shrugged Alice’s jacket off, passing it back to her without looking, “I’m fine, okay? We’re just friends. Focus on your own relationship.”</p><p>It was a little harsh maybe but Rio couldn’t help but push back at her friend, her friend who had spent most of her time recently talking about either Jen or Awards. Who once a day asked Rio how she was but never probed further.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>.”</p><p>Rio kept her gaze out the window, her jaw flexing and unflexing as the streets of Santa Monica flew past.</p><p>“When did we get this way?”</p><p>All wind went out of her sails then. Rio deflated where she sat. She felt a hand on her arm and a hand on her cheek and turned to see Alice frowning at her, her dark eyes tracing over her own pained features.</p><p>“We don’t talk anymore.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“We don’t.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and bit down on her lip as Alice pulled her hand away from her cheek, and her gaze dropped too.</p><p>Alice had been her constant, even more than her parents, because Alice understood the industry. She knew the pressures and the demands and had been with Rio through it all.</p><p>And now she was keeping a huge part of herself hidden from Alice. A piece of her that would have to remain hidden until someone else made the decision for her that it was no longer a secret to keep.</p><p>The soft nature of Rio Vidal meant that for this she was sorry, for this she was sympathetic to whatever her best friend was feeling.</p><p>But her misery had hardened a piece of her that poked a madness inside that wanted to accuse Alice of not looking, of not paying attention, of not helping her through.</p><p>Only, giving in to the hardness in her meant opening a crack that could spill out Agatha’s secret too.</p><p>So she cautiously reached back out for Alice and took a deep breath before she whispered, “I like her. A lot. And you should have known that when I told you in my trailer all those months ago. I’ve spent time with her since and I still like her and I don’t think it’ll go away any time soon so I’m working through it. But I need you to be with me on this. Because it’s painful and heavy and the only thing I can do is to keep going and hope that you’ll be my friend on this. Properly. No telling Jen or announcing over drinks that I feel this way. Because I want her and I’ve not wanted anyone like this before and I just can’t…”</p><p>A lone tear slipped down her cheek and Rio closed her eyes as Alice reached to brush it away.</p><p>“Okay,” she said just as softly, “okay you have me. It’s not stupid, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio shook her head then and turned away from Alice, looking out the window to try to steady herself, feeling a little lighter than she had before.</p><p>“It’s as stupid as you trying to put me in outer space with a glowing sword.”</p><p>“I mean, she is kinda outta this world.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Alice snickered and moved her blazer back over to cover Rio’s lap.</p><p>They were silent for a while. The kind of silence that’s comfortable and Rio relaxed into it.</p><p>“Are we using ‘like’ when we mean ‘love’, Rio?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>They sat quietly again until Alice spoke and Rio turned to her when she did.</p><p>“You should know that she contacted me over Christmas.”</p><p>“She did?”</p><p>“Mm. She said she needed a contact that Jen couldn’t get which I thought was weird at the time but I didn’t ask. I was in the middle of contract negotiations anyway so I was a little busy but she called and-…”</p><p>“Who did she want?”</p><p>“Well, she wanted Stark.”</p><p>“Tony Stark?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“But she would easily be able to get that from Jen.”</p><p>“That’s what I’m saying. Anyway, we didn’t talk for long but she did ask me how you were. Which again I thought was-…”</p><p>“When was this?”</p><p>“I don’t know, day after Christmas, maybe? I was up in Jen’s old room trying to negotiate-…”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Right. Well she seemed concerned about you and I just said you were fine, with your parents, and I hadn’t really heard from you which wasn’t unusual.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, frowning a little as she dropped her gaze to the blazer covering her legs.</p><p>The day after Christmas had been the day after their last messages. The day after Agatha had stopped responding after Rio’s stupid joke.</p><p>“Did you have a fight?”</p><p>Rio looked up suddenly, frowning as she took Alice in. “No. I just… we hadn’t spoken much since Boston so maybe she was just curious.”</p><p>Alice only nodded and Rio looked back out the window again, toying with the end of her hair and wrapping it and rewrapping it in her fingers.</p><p>“Are you not seeing anyone else because-…?”</p><p><em>Because I’m waiting for Agatha to be ready. Because whenever I close my eyes I can feel her hands on me. Because I want only her.</em></p><p>“Because it’s not fair on anyone else when I’m so hung up on her.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>They were silent again on the journey back to Rio’s place where Alice was crashing for the night.</p><p>Rio fell asleep faster than she thought she might but slept fitfully, unable to escape the pangs of yearning as she did.</p><p>By morning everything felt a little softer again and she had nothing to do except to shower and allow the next round of dress fittings to happen.</p><p>The Golden Globes was the big one. It was second maybe to the Oscars, though the upcoming SAG awards were important too. Everything seemed important at this point.</p><p>The atmosphere in the little Spanish house was quieter than usual but calmer than it had been for a while. Alice had opted to put her phone away whilst Rio was pressed and moulded into different options and Rio knew that her best friend was trying to make up for time lost.</p><p>It meant she had whatever coffee or juice she wanted before she even had to ask.</p><p>It meant that Alice was a little kinder than she might normally be about some of the dress options and it meant that by the time the day was done and Alice was leaving with the people hired to dress and beautify Rio, that the actress felt a little better again.</p><p>She showered off all her makeup and changed into soft pyjamas before heading down the stairs to return to her favourite position on the couch with a glass of red and an old movie she wouldn’t have to pay much attention to.</p><p>For the first time that day she picked her phone up and skimmed through the various texts and missed calls from people she liked and people she didn’t.</p><p>And there, at 9:37am, was a notification from Agatha. A missed call.</p><p>She stared at it then checked her WhatsApp to see if there were any messages. But the last one had been from Christmas Day where Agatha hadn’t text back.</p><p>It took her another ten minutes and a whole glass of wine to buck up the courage to call Agatha back.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>It rang and rang and Rio began to lose hope that Agatha would answer until she was pulling her phone from her ear and she heard her voice.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Hey. I’m sorry I missed your call.”</p><p>“It’s fine. I was just checking in.”</p><p>Rio frowned a little, gazing down at the rug beneath her feet. “Worried I’d taken my loss badly?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>Agatha sounded soft, sounded relaxed, and Rio wondered where she was in her house, what she was wearing, what she was doing.</p><p>“Are you there?”</p><p>“Yes. Sorry. Just-…”</p><p>“I’m sorry I didn’t text back at Christmas. The house was full and I didn’t want to be seen to be-…”</p><p>“It’s fine, Agatha. I pushed it and I should have been more sensible.”</p><p>“You weren’t wearing your necklace yesterday,” Agatha said after a brief pause.</p><p>“Which?”</p><p>“Very funny.”</p><p>“Did you want me to?”</p><p>There was silence for a second and then Agatha spoke again and this time her voice was even quieter, “It was good to see you.”</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>Rio began twirling her hair and heard movement on the other end of the line, and she again found herself wondering where Agatha was, what she was doing.</p><p>“It was a PR decision. To have Ralph there.”</p><p>“And was it a PR decision to not mention him in your speech?”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha release a soft breath and she closed her eyes, knowing how that breath would feel against her skin.</p><p>“I wasn’t really thinking about him in that moment.”</p><p>“Were you thinking about me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Have you thought any more about… about what we discussed?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Rio shifted and thought she heard a chink of glass in the other end of the line.</p><p>“It’s not easy, Rio.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I need time.”</p><p>“I’m trying to give you it.”</p><p>“Trying?”</p><p>Rio released a slow breath and ran a hand through her hair, “I’m here for you. I’m giving you space and time and… I have to see you with him and it <em>kills</em> me that he won’t even give you his jacket until he sees me trying.”</p><p>“You know it’s just bravado. Nothing more.”</p><p>“But he can touch you and kiss you and I get, what? A shout out in a speech and a quick kiss on the cheek?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I just… I miss you.”</p><p>It hurt to even say the words and hurt even more acutely when she heard Agatha draw in a sharp breath.</p><p>“Can I see you before Sunday?”</p><p>“I have ADR and fittings and-…” Agatha started softly.</p><p>“It’s fine. It’s fine.”</p><p>“I want to see you too.”</p><p>“Will Ralph be there Sunday?”</p><p>“Jen wants him to be.”</p><p>“What about what you want?”</p><p>“It’s just a night, Rio.”</p><p>“Which after party are you going to?”</p><p>“Whichever one you’re at.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and rubbed her hand over her face, sitting in the warm glow of the comment for a second before she said, knowing fully that she was feasting now on crumbs:</p><p>“Can you try to push back on him coming? Just this once.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Can’t wear two jackets all night, can I?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and settled back a little more on the couch, feeling slightly more relaxed now she knew Ralph wouldn’t be there.</p><p>“What are you wearing?”</p><p>“It’s silver. Sleeveless.”</p><p>“No, I meant now.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious?”</p><p>“I just want to picture you.”</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly and Rio thought she’d refuse but she spoke again and was softer once more. “I’m in a red sweater. I’m wearing these soft pants and I have thick socks on and my hair is up. I’m in the den and I’ve been drinking red wine and reading my book.”</p><p>“Are you under a blanket?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“The same one we sat under?”</p><p>There was a pause. “Yes.”</p><p>“Do you wish I were there?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes again and felt sick with it, with the image of Agatha there without her.</p><p>“I should go,” she said quietly, the pull was too strong, the yearning suddenly too much for her.</p><p>“Stay on. Just a little while. We don’t even have to talk about anything. Just… stay?”</p><p>And Rio took in a shaky breath and moved to lay down, tugging her hood up and over her head as she stared at the coffee table before her.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>She was silent for a while, listening intently to the soft noises of Agatha moving around on the other end and she wondered if she were simply trying to get comfortable or if she felt uncomfortable in the silence.</p><p>“Why did you call Alice for Stark’s number?”</p><p>The question must have taken Agatha by surprise because she didn’t answer for a while and Rio waited patiently in the quiet.</p><p>“I wanted to talk to him about a movie.”</p><p>“Couldn’t Jen help?”</p><p>“Jen doesn’t want me to do it.”</p><p>Rio nodded and chewed on her lip for a second, “Alice says you’re not on the best terms?”</p><p>“We’re okay now. It wasn’t great after Boston.”</p><p>“I’m sorry about that.”</p><p>“Don’t be. I reached out to tell you we were going because I wanted you there.”</p><p>“Then I’m glad I came.”</p><p>Rio plucked at the thread of a cushion.</p><p>“Can we talk now about you spending a whole day with my parents?”</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“My mom wants me to practise my Spanish because of you. Says you’re much better.”</p><p>“I usually am.”</p><p>“Funny. Why didn’t you call?”</p><p>“It was a spur of the moment thing. I just had to get out the house.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“My life is complicated, Rio.”</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>She heard Agatha sigh. “My mother’s not an easy woman and Ralph can do no wrong in her eyes and Nicky… I just wanted to give him some space for a while and knew he’d be happier if he could see you.”</p><p>Rio plucked so hard at the thread it began to unravel the floral pattern.</p><p>“Plus we already had gifts for you so…” Agatha trailed off.</p><p>“I wish you’d called.”</p><p>“Next time.”</p><p>“Ralph told me he bought a season ticket for the Bulls.”</p><p>There was another silence then and Rio began wrapping the excess thread around her finger.</p><p>“Nicky still wears your jersey.”</p><p>Rio nodded and swallowed thickly, watching the pattern of the cushion dissolve further as she continued to pull at the thread.</p><p>“I’m sorry my being at the game with you meant that-…”</p><p>“It’s not your fault. Ralph is just petty. He’s pissed Nicky won’t go along with him. Thinks he’s too much of a mommy’s boy.”</p><p>“See? If anything were to happen there’s no way they could take him from you.”</p><p>The silence felt heavier then and Rio watched as she peeled away another petal with the thread in her fingers.</p><p>“You’re Nicky’s favourite and you’re also my mom’s favourite,” Rio said in an attempt to lighten the mood again.</p><p>Agatha laughed softly down the phone and she found herself smiling at the sound of it.</p><p>“I’ve missed that sound.”</p><p>“How did we get here?”</p><p>“You tried to kiss me when I was drunk in a bathroom and I’ve been hooked ever since.”</p><p>“You make it sound so dirty.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure it was dirty. The bathroom, that is.”</p><p>“I should have kissed you in the pool.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach flipped at the memory. Agatha’s freckled skin, the light burn across her chest, Rio’s legs so cautiously wrapped around her waist in the warm water. The way Agatha had looked at her.</p><p>“Why didn’t you?”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure you wanted it.”</p><p>Rio blew out a heavy breath and rolled onto her back, “I’m sure I couldn’t have been <em>more</em> obvious.”</p><p>“You were barely touching me.”</p><p>“Because I thought if I pressed myself against you you’d press charges.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, “Well I probably would have accidentally drowned us. But not for horror that you tried something.”</p><p>“From sheer desire?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>Rio hummed and they both went quiet again. Half the flower was gone.</p><p>“Do you think we could get away? Have that week together you mentioned?”</p><p>“When did I mention a week?”</p><p>“You said a day wouldn’t be enough, and then a week wouldn’t be either.”</p><p>“A week of just us?”</p><p>“Yes. I have time after February. Not a lot. Then I’m shooting from March onwards.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, “I have some time.”</p><p>“Then could we?”</p><p>“Where would we go?”</p><p>“Anywhere. Everywhere. Wherever you wanted.”</p><p>“I want somewhere no one can get to us. Just you and me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched a little and she dared push a little more, “Can we?”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll look into it.”</p><p>If this is what fireworks felt like then Rio couldn’t believe people weren’t shouting about them more often. Her body felt too warm suddenly and she was blushing beneath the hood she’d just pulled up for comfort.</p><p>“Imagine what we can do in a whole week.”</p><p>There was one petal left.</p><p>“I’m actually not planning on doing anything.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“Just you.”</p><p>Rio shivered despite how warm she felt and closed her eyes, “Don’t say things like that when I can’t-…”</p><p>“Jen, I’ll call you later.”</p><p>Agatha had hung up.</p><p>The flower was gone.</p><p>Rio blinked at her phone, stared at her home screen. And felt the clanging realisation that snippets of Agatha were all she’d ever get if Agatha didn’t leave her marriage.</p><p>Ralph must have appeared.</p><p>And far from what they’d just been discussing, if Ralph knew Agatha were talking late at night to Rio she suspected by now that he wouldn’t like it.</p><p>She dropped her phone to the side and pulled her hood tighter around her despite the heat and fell asleep on the couch that night, frustrated and self-pitying, a red thread tied tightly around her finger.</p><p>But waking came with the reminder that Agatha would be at the Globes alone. That she’d go to the same after party as Rio. And that she wanted a week with her.</p><p>She was still married. But she wanted Rio.</p><p>When Sunday rolled around Rio was practically vibrating with excitement to see Agatha that she’d forgotten she was nominated for a Golden Globe.</p><p>“Would you sit still,” Alice huffed and pulled Rio’s hand away from her glass of champagne as she tapped out the tune to ‘Go Your Own Way’ on the glass with her new sparkly nails.</p><p>“I’m excited.”</p><p>“You’re annoying.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes as the makeup artist moved in to start painting her lips.</p><p>“Shtup,” she muttered, trying not to move her lips as she narrowed her eyes at Alice through the mirror.</p><p>But the telIings off continued to come throughout the rest of the afternoon as Rio fidgeted where she sat or where she stood and Alice was hopeless to stop it whilst the glam squad were either laughing at the little arguments they kept having or else ignoring them as they made the movie star that now stood before them.</p><p>“I sometimes think it’s a miracle what can happen in just four hours with five experts.”</p><p>“Shut. Up.”</p><p>Rio twirled for the full effect, her green dress shimmering in the light with the delicate beading that patterned it.</p><p>“Where did you get that necklace?”</p><p>Alice looked curiously at the gem at the base of Rio’s throat as Rio wriggled her sparkly nails in her face to show them off.</p><p>“A gift.”</p><p>Rio was glad Alice dropped the subject and she went to kiss the glam squad goodbye, thanking them all for turning her into someone who looked like they belonged on a red carpet.</p><p>She’d be seeing them all again anyway when they appeared in the room at the Beverly Hills Hilton that they’d bought for the quick change between the ceremony and the after party.</p><p>But Alice was a stickler for timings and knew exactly when they should leave to get to the red carpet precisely when they meant to.</p><p>So Rio had barely the time to knock back her next glass of champagne before she was hurried from the cosy confines of her home to the waiting SUV to take them to the Hilton for the ceremony.</p><p>If Cannes were a big deal, then the Golden Globes was the ultimate deal.</p><p>Rio could barely breathe as she entered the carpet.</p><p>She couldn’t move for flashes all around her and her name being shouted and screamed from every which way.</p><p>She felt hot all over and worried she was blushing as she walked down the carpet.</p><p>But Alice was near and she kept grinning at her, kept offering a thumbs up whenever she could see her through the lights, and so she assumed she at least didn’t look ridiculous.</p><p>She found Wanda in the middle of a press gaggle and squeezed her side as she breezed by, interrupting the interview for barely a few seconds in favour of saying hi to her friend.</p><p>She swanned in and out of journalist’s bubbles to hit them with a sound bite, a quip, a smile or a wave.</p><p>But her eyes were constantly scanning for Agatha, for the woman who’d said she’d be there alone.</p><p>It was after Rio’s tenth interview along the carpet at the top of a set of inexplicable stairs that she had to walk gingerly up that she saw her.</p><p>The host of the E! network coverage was asking about her recent movie and she stuttered where she spoke as her eyes fell to Agatha, squeezing through the busy crowds with a scowling Jen just behind her.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t lied about her dress. It was strapless and structured, straight up and down and giving Agatha a column silhouette. It made her look timeless. Carved by angels.</p><p>And Rio could have stared for hours.</p><p>But the question still had to be answered and so she turned away.</p><p>“I-yeah, it was this gritty, earthy, crazy time. We had a lot of fun.”</p><p>The interview wrapped and Rio thanked the host with a smile and a quick handshake and she was walking down slowly, taking Alice’s hand to steady herself.</p><p>Only she hadn’t looked up to see who she was walking towards.</p><p>Whose arms were now out towards her to catch her on the last two steps.</p><p>Whose smile was brighter than the dress she wore and whose eyes were focused on Rio’s hungry gaze.</p><p>Behind her she heard a shout of, “And Agatha has arrived everyone! Agatha Harkness! Let’s see if we can get here to come up here.”</p><p>But the mingled noise of everything else and the arms that now encircled her cut off everything.</p><p>Agatha was pulling her into a tight squeeze and despite feeling like she was on fire and her ribs couldn’t take much more pressure she felt like she could breathe again.</p><p>“You’re with Jen,” Rio whispered as turned her head slightly, and felt the ghost of Agatha’s breath against her neck.</p><p>“You wore your necklace.”</p><p>Rio smiled and leant back, her hands falling to rest her fingertips on Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>She felt delirious, unable to form the words she so desperately wanted to say. But Agatha seemed to know she was struggling to act like a rational human being so she leant in and kissed her cheek sweetly, murmuring close to her ear, “I’ve missed you.”</p><p>She pulled away then and Rio felt dizzy as she stood and watched Agatha sweep by, Jen dutifully following her after gently squeezing Rio’s arm in greeting as she passed her by.</p><p>Rio took a slow breath in as Alice came to take her hand and pull her down.</p><p>It couldn’t have lasted as long as it felt. It must have been ten seconds at most. Because Alice wasn’t fussed by the pause in her schedule and Jen hadn’t looked like she was going to kill Rio.</p><p>But it had felt like a lifetime. It had felt like a whole other world just being held by Agatha in the most public arena in the world.</p><p>She was a movie star in love with a movie star and Rio Vidal was on top of the world.</p><p>The rest of the carpet flew by because Rio couldn’t think about much else.</p><p>She answered every question thrown her way as if it were her favourite question and she’d never been asked it before.</p><p>She smiled and waved and posed and laughed because for that night, for that one night, Agatha had left her husband for her.</p><p>But the Hilton ballroom wasn’t an easy place to find someone. So Rio didn’t see Agatha for a  long time as it filled with people wilfully not going to their own seats and instead milling around by their friends or by people they thought more famous than them and therefore people they’d <em>like</em> to be friends with.</p><p>Rio sat with Wanda and a few of the team from A24 and made polite small talk with them in between gossiping with Wanda about what everyone was wearing, who already looked like they were going to win and who looked so nervous they might vomit.</p><p>The food on the tables went ignored and just as Rio was reaching for another glass of champagne - though she’d promised Alice she wouldn’t have any more - she saw Agatha through the crowds.</p><p>“Goddamn,” Wanda muttered quietly as her gaze fell to her as well.</p><p>“She’s beautiful,” Rio whispered softly, unsure why she suddenly felt shy under Agatha’s steady gaze, wondering why she felt like she should have tried to impress her more with her outfit, worn something more worthy of her.</p><p>It was too late to worry now because Agatha was arriving at their table and Wanda stood first to greet her.</p><p>“Agatha! You look incredible.”</p><p>“You too,” Agatha said with a small smile as she accepted the hug but kept her eyes on Rio who now stood just beside Wanda.</p><p>“I’ve just found my seat and you’re right beside it if you want me to show you?”</p><p>Rio blinked, having expected another hug or some small talk but she couldn’t deny Agatha anything and even the thirty seconds it would take to walk to her table beside Agatha would be the best thirty seconds of her year so far.</p><p>“Sure,” she breathed, turning to kiss Wanda’s cheek, “I’ll see you in the breaks?”</p><p>Wanda looked a little hurt but Rio touched her hand briefly and then turned to Agatha who’d already angled herself away, clearly not keen to hang around.</p><p>“She’s nice, you know,” Rio muttered as they made steps away from the red head. “You’d like her.”</p><p>“I don’t like many people.”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a wry smile and Rio just rolled her eyes and boldly swung her hand forwards to hold Agatha’s. “We’re actors,” she whispered when Agatha made to pull away. “We touch. Look around.”</p><p>And sure enough the room was full of two types of people: the ones who were grinning and hugging and squeezing, and the ones who were smiling and shaking hands. But Agatha’s eyes took none of that in and she simply held Rio’s hand more firmly in her own, and led her in this way to their tables.</p><p>“You’re behind me?” Rio asked as she looked between the two place names with a raised brow.</p><p>“Of course not. You were over the other side. I moved you. Alice too.”</p><p>“You <em>moved</em> me?” Rio asked incredulously, fighting off the grin that threatened to split her face in two as Agatha sat down before her and still held her hand between them.</p><p>“Are you going to sit down?”</p><p>Rio laughed and sat slowly, watching as Agatha’s eyes fell to her necklace and then a few inches south before her gaze snapped up again.</p><p>“Subtle,” she said quietly, turning their hands over so she could link their fingers. She scooted her chair in closer.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned softly but didn’t drop her hold.</p><p>“I’ve missed you. Allow me this.”</p><p>“We’ll be pounced on any second.”</p><p>“Then let me enjoy it for a second.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and dropped her gaze to their joined hands, rubbing her thumb back and forth slowly and giving Rio time to take her in again.</p><p>Her hair was loose and draped over one shoulder and her lipstick was ruby red and Rio wanted it painted all over her body. But Agatha was looking up again and for the briefest moment she looked sad as she took Rio in.</p><p>“Have you… been seeing anyone?”</p><p>But Rio’s response was lost as Agatha’s prediction came true. They were pounced on.</p><p>Agatha sprang to her feet as Jen arrived with a group of important looking men in ill-fitting suits and Rio jumped up too, because everyone was just as keen to speak to her as they were to Agatha.</p><p>Only Rio now had a permanent support system in place for this type of barrage.</p><p>Agatha had placed her hand on the small of Rio’s back and if the fact that it had been there for over five minutes now meant anything it meant that she wasn’t keen on removing it any time soon.</p><p>But heaven could only hold on so long and soon the lights were flashing and there were calls from around the room for everyone to take their seats.</p><p>Agatha’s hand moved to Rio’s from her back and she squeezed it gently, making Rio turn to her with a lazily smile, “What?”</p><p>“Good luck,” Agatha grinned, her free hand moving to brush the jewel of Rio’s necklace, “I think you’ll need it.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes but realised something she hadn’t noticed before. She turned their hands over and looked down at Agatha’s in her own, seeing it completely empty of rings.</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and gently dropped Rio’s hand, “I wanted to be free tonight.”</p><p>They locked eyes and Rio could only nod once, only swallow down the desire to take Agatha’s hand and run with her from this stuffy, stifling ballroom. Because Hollywood didn’t matter when she had Agatha for the night.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice hissed urgently, tugging at her arm where she’d just arrived by her side to take her place. “No more gossiping.”</p><p>Rio barely blinked but sat slowly, endlessly grateful that Agatha had moved her around so she could be just across the aisle from her, within an arm’s length if she were to lean around and want to touch her. And of course she wanted to reach across and touch her.</p><p>Rio’s body was set to vibrate again because she could hear Agatha’s voice and hear her laugh and when they both turned to look up to the stage she always caught her eye, sometimes caught a wink.</p><p>It felt like the secret wasn’t so scary or hard anymore. Like it was instead glamorous and sexy.</p><p>Like she could flirt and touch and not be caught because everyone else was doing it.</p><p>Hell, one of the producers on her table was already so smashed he was falling asleep into his tux.</p><p>In the grand tradition of the Globes, the opening monologue started out with a roasting of all the guests.</p><p>Alice had prepared Rio for it. She’d made her practice her smiles and ‘I’m vaguely insulted by that but it’s totally true’ faces. It had been a humiliating hour.</p><p>The roast started off slow, getting a few titters from the audience and then the jabs began to pick up in their venom and Rio could feel the tension in the room rising.</p><p>“And over here we have Agatha Harkness!! Yes, yes,” the host agreed, clapping his hands with the eruption from the room, “one of the greats. One of the greats. Agatha is here tonight with her movie: <em>No Heaven Like This</em>, a light hearted romp about a mother losing her child. But we’re not hear to laugh at dead children, obviously. Let’s talk about how Agatha’s <em>real life</em> child actually looks like another actress in the room, Rio Vidal!”</p><p>Rio was biting on her tongue, desperate to turn and see how Agatha was taking this.</p><p>She got a few cheers from the crowd and felt Alice’s foot gently nudge her own below the table.</p><p>“Ironic, really, considering how Rio is of course a beautiful Latina woman but actually she just looks like a little white boy whose grandmother practically funded the modern Republican Party.”</p><p>There was a great intake of breath about the room and some low “oohs” rather than laughs at this and Rio managed to smile softly, but refused to give any more.</p><p>When the comedian had moved on after an “alright, alright”, Rio turned to Agatha across the aisle and nudged her shoulder. Agatha turned slightly and shot her a small smile, and Rio knew she’d never give her more than that when cameras were around but she wanted her to know she was checking on her all the same.</p><p>By the time of the first break, Rio was fidgeting again, desperate to get to Agatha. But she didn’t even have a chance because Agatha was on her instead.</p><p>She’d stood from her chair and was leaning around Rio under the pretence of stealing a champagne bottle from the table and whispered as she did: “Jen’s furious. Hates it when people are reminded who my mother is.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only reach back for the hand that still rested on her shoulder as Agatha straightened up and Jen appeared by Rio’s side.</p><p>“Goddamn you, Vidal. Next time you want to go to a basketball game-…”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha squeeze her shoulder, “We agreed it was done.”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat then and went to stand by Jen, wrapping an arm around her waist. “Not tonight, babe.”</p><p>Jen pursed her lips and Rio smiled widely up at her, unable to do anything but when Agatha was so gloriously standing above her like a protective partner.</p><p>“Got you a few more lesbian fans, Jennifer.”</p><p>Jen just rolled her eyes and placed her hands on Alice’s arm. “She had those already.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and felt Agatha’s hand twitch where she held it gently against her shoulder, her fingers tickling along her skin until they came into contact with the necklace at the crook of her neck and Rio had to fight the blush at such an intimate touch that went unnoticed by Jen and Alice as they had turned into one another and started to talk about category position (second to last of the night).</p><p>Rio turned her head properly then, shifting in her seat to look up at Agatha with raised brows, “Yes?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha smiled a little and pulled away, actually stealing the champagne as she took her seat again.</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at her and couldn’t help but think she’d been trying to get a reaction from her and she’d managed it, which was infuriating.</p><p>The ceremony went on and Rio’s giddiness never died down.</p><p>When people came to stop by during ad breaks she found that Agatha was always a little closer to her even if she weren’t in the conversation.</p><p>She managed to find a way to brush past or to squeeze her and Rio found herself doing the same every opportunity she got.</p><p>She’d stopped drinking now for fear she’d get too drunk and simply sit on top of Agatha and give everyone a real show. Besides, her category was up next and she couldn’t be caught looking drunk whilst trying to give a gracious loser face.</p><p>She sat up a little straighter, felt Alice touch her back, saw the grins on everyone’s faces along the table, and then tried to focus in on the presenter.</p><p>The names of the nominees were read out just as they had been three nights ago.</p><p>Agatha first.</p><p>The other three: Sylvia, Isla, Jessica this time, and Wanda next.</p><p>Then Rio.</p><p>And Rio nodded and grinned when her face filled the big screen and she felt another gentle touch from Alice on her back.</p><p>She wondered if Agatha might mention her first again. If without Ralph there, she’d feel the need to thank him, if she might even say she loved him.</p><p>But then there were other possibilities: Agatha might even stand up and kiss her. She might even announce to the room and to the millions watching at home that she was leaving Ralph and running away with Rio.</p><p>Perhaps she’d propose.</p><p>But Rio was shaken from her daydream. Literally.</p><p>Alice was shaking her and other hands were on her, grabbing her arms and tugging her waist.</p><p>And with wide, frightened eyes, Rio looked around frantically for the source of the panic, for the thing that everyone was trying to pull her from, until she saw Agatha and the sea parted and the hands moved and the only person she felt was Agatha as she held her face and Agatha as she kissed her cheek and Agatha as she spoke into her ear: “You need to get up there, Rio, now.”</p><p>Rio’s whole body stiffened where she’d just been holding Agatha’s arms and she felt the sea of people move with her, Agatha turning her to push her by the waist up to the stage.</p><p>It took a producer from Agatha’s table to offer his arm out to her to get her to actually walk up the stairs to the microphone and even when there she accepted the award with a horrified expression on her face, her mind trying to catch up with what had just happened to her.</p><p>Someone kissed her cheek and turned her to the mic as she clutched her award and for a second Rio just stared at the mass of expectant faces.</p><p>She blinked until she looked down at the real life Golden Globe in her hand and something about the weight of it, about the cool metal against her warm palms shocked her into action.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she muttered unthinkingly, only looking up when people started to laugh.</p><p>“I-I… I feel like I just spaced out for a second and-…”</p><p>But this wasn’t a good start to a speech. It wasn’t eloquent or commanding like Agatha’s had been only a few days ago.</p><p>She swallowed and looked out to where she’d come from and saw Alice standing and clutching her heart and Agatha just along from her, also standing, beaming up at her and nodding as if to get her to continue.</p><p>“I’m just a kid from Delaware who fell in love with movies at a really young age. I used to dream of playing for a living, of putting on different clothes and… and being free.”</p><p>Her voice sounded alien to her. It sounded too high pitched. Her words were coming out too fast.</p><p>She bit her lip and glanced down at the Globe in her hands, before she looked towards Agatha again. She was still standing, still watching her, still smiling.</p><p>“Firstly, I want to thank the person I consider to be the best actress of our generation, of anyone’s generation, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>There was a smattering of applause and Rio smiled as Agatha rolled her eyes at her.</p><p>She felt more like herself now. Her breathing was evening out slowly. Her smile softening to be less than manic. Her words a little less shrill.</p><p>“My fellow nominees, Wanda, Isla, Jessica, Sylvia.”</p><p>More applause.</p><p>“The HFPA. My team, my Alice, my cast and crew, my incredible mom and dad. I’m so grateful to you all.”</p><p>She smiled a little wider this time and made sure to look everywhere but at Agatha, not wanting to give herself away.</p><p>Her brain had slowed down properly and she could form coherent thoughts now.</p><p>“And this is dedicated to any little kid, any person, who dreams of one day being free. Thank you. Te veo.”</p><p>Someone led Rio off the stage and Rio felt robotic as she followed them. She felt like she’d just lied to everyone or that she’d somehow misunderstood why everyone had ushered her up there.</p><p>But the press backstage was very real.</p><p>And Rio hadn’t thought that it would be even remotely a possibility that she’d be here, that she’d be clutching a Golden Globe.</p><p>But here she was.</p><p>And here they were.</p><p>And then there was Alice, Alice who’d clearly fought her way backstage to be there. She stood at the sides and smiled at her through tears she’d clearly been fighting since Rio’s name was announced.</p><p>The room was too loud to think. Too loud to allow Rio to process her emotions.</p><p>So she powered through, answering everything as best she possibly could.</p><p>Running on the fumes of disbelief, she made her way from the stage after twenty minutes of intense questions and found Alice still waiting, still almost crying.</p><p>“Holy shit,” they said in tandem and dissolved into fits of laughter as they were escorted from the little press holding room.</p><p>Rio was met from all sides by more press and more attendees and she could barely think for the next hour as she was moved and guided and photographed and interviewed.</p><p>There was pre-Golden Globe and post.</p><p>And Rio liked post very much.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be a little nicer to her, everyone was a little happier to see her. And she was a famous actress: people were <em>always</em> happy to see her.</p><p>Funnelled through to the little room where she was to get her Globe engraved, Rio finally had a second to breathe.</p><p>Only breathing in a very busy room where cameras were still pointed at you from every angle wasn’t exactly the most relaxing experience of her life.</p><p>More hands had never touched her before, more lips had never honed in on her cheek, and more praise had never been thrown her way before. But none of them came from the person she wanted to see the most.</p><p>It took Alice and a very helpful security guard to extract Rio from the venue almost two hours after she’d won.</p><p>They ran through the lobby of the hotel high on their success and drunk on their incredulity.</p><p>Alice had arranged for Rio’s change of clothes to be setup in a small room in the hotel which was a miracle because Rio needed to take her shoes off just as much as she needed a moment’s peace and a very large glass of wine.</p><p>“We did it kid,” Alice was saying as Rio huffed a laugh and fell backwards onto the bed.</p><p>The makeup artist knelt beside her and Rio closed her eyes as she allowed her to paint her lips a slightly different shade of red to the one before.</p><p>She was silent for a while as she allowed this.</p><p>“Can we stop now? No more awards? No more parties?”</p><p>“You love a party.”</p><p>“I love not having sore feet.”</p><p>Alice laughed as the champagne popped and Rio leant up to begin wrestling her shoes off of her feet.</p><p>Her stylist moved quickly over to help and Rio wasn’t sure whether it was to ensure she got her aching feet free faster or it was simply because he was worried she was being too aggressive with the delicate straps.</p><p>“I gave Jen our room number.”</p><p>Rio almost fell from the bed as she struggled with the clasp of her right shoe. The kind hands of her stylist helped her remain steady.</p><p>“<em>Alice.</em>”</p><p>“Relax. They’re going where we’re going. I just thought it would be easier. Besides, Ralph isn’t here and I thought maybe you’d want to see her a bit.”</p><p>Rio flopped back onto the bed and flung her arm over her eyes. Her feet were now free. Someone squeezed her calf.</p><p>Alice was beside her, leaning over her, whispering:</p><p>“Do you want to see her?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Then stop complaining.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little, unable to tell Alice that she wanted to see Agatha <em>alone</em> because then maybe she’d get at least a little above the dress action away from prying eyes. But she supposed seeing Agatha in a room of just the four of them and the hard-working artists was as much as she could hope for.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“That Oscar’s yours, baby.”</p><p>Rio laughed properly this time, her stomach actually hurting from it by the time she got her breath back.</p><p>The room cheered for her.</p><p>There was a knock just as Rio’s breathing was evening out again and she sat up on her elbows suddenly, watching with wide eyes as Alice went to open it, holding a glass of champagne in one hand.</p><p>Jen stepped in first and looked less than pleased and Agatha stepped in right after, looking a little smug.</p><p>And looking absolutely earth-shatteringly gorgeous.</p><p>She wore a short white dress with sheer panels over her thighs and upper chest and Rio wasn’t sure she suddenly wasn’t drooling.</p><p>Her mouth felt dry and her cheeks felt hot and she couldn’t stop staring.</p><p>“Agatha gave you that win, you know.”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said firmly as she moved to lean back against the wall by the door, intentionally or not now giving Rio a full view of her look for the after party.</p><p>Rio’s gaze fell to toned thighs that had been around her waist, around her head, and she felt dizzy with desire.</p><p>“The HFPA have no interest in-…”</p><p>“HFPA, HPV, whatever. I <em>know</em> your comments and your field trip helped.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyes again and caught Agatha looking her over. She looked just as hungry as Rio felt.</p><p>She sat up properly then, some of the thoughts now able to return to her brain now she’d got just a semblance of satisfaction knowing Agatha wanted her too, and raised her brows at Jen, “Maybe I am just appreciated as a good actress.”</p><p>Agatha smirked at her and Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek.</p><p>“Or maybe they were just awarding her excellent management,” Alice smiled as she forced champagne into Jen’s hand.</p><p>“Maybe you both just annoyed them into it.”</p><p>“Listen, if I could annoy people into things I’d be on a beach somewhere right now with a pretty girl on my sun lounger.”</p><p>“Is that right?” Agatha asked with raised brows and a tight jaw.</p><p>Rio only grinned and flopped onto her back. Not looking at Agatha was safer. She could pretend she wasn’t what had caused the dull ache between her thighs.</p><p>“The prettiest girl.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed from her position still against the wall and Rio laughed quietly, flinging her arm over her eyes.</p><p>“Anyway, we should get going Agatha.”</p><p>“Stay for a drink?” Rio asked suddenly, sitting up straight and looking only at Agatha.</p><p>Her pillar-box red lipstick juxtaposed so brilliantly with the white of her dress. So much so that she looked like a chic French bride, or the top new fantasy of Rio Vidal on cold, lonely nights.</p><p>“Maybe one,” Agatha said, smiling down at Rio from where she still stood. She reached out and accepted the glass Alice was now passing to her. “A toast to the winner of the evening.”</p><p>“I’m not toasting to that,” Jen said with a deep frown, now Alice wasn’t wrapped around her she’d wrapped her own arm around her waist. “It’s like putting bad juju on the next awards and I’m not risking it.”</p><p>“BAFTA will go Agatha’s way,” Alice said with a smile.</p><p>“Because they’re all old and posh?” Rio shot Agatha a grin and found that Agatha shot her such a teasingly furious look that she had to not look again.</p><p>She flopped back onto her back.</p><p>Someone tutted nearby and Rio was pulled to her feet and before she could protest she was whisked from the room to the bathroom to change.</p><p>She was malleable, biddable, to the hands removing her dress for her and placing her new one over her head and shoulders. She was given a sip of champagne through a straw after her new dress was put on and she stared at the new version of herself in the mirror.</p><p>She’d been in a softer green before and now she was in a fierce red.</p><p>She stepped from the bathroom, fully hoping Agatha’s tongue would fall out of her mouth at the sight of her. But it was just Alice. And <em>her</em> tongue remained resolutely inside her mouth.</p><p>“Damn, Vidal. A winner!”</p><p>“Where did they go?”</p><p>“They just stopped by, couldn’t hang out forever.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said with a smile that didn’t quite meet her eyes.</p><p>Alice chewed on her lip and turned away to grab her purse from the side.</p><p>“Let’s go and greet your admiring public.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but turned to give the team one last goodbye and several hugs and kisses and then followed Alice down the hall and to Netflix’s big after party bash.</p><p>The requisite social posts were taken along the way.</p><p>“Your socials have been blowing up, by the way. <em>Everyone</em> loved the speech. And lots of chat online about Agatha coming to help you up the stage.”</p><p>“She didn’t help me up.”</p><p>“She <em>woke</em> you up, more like. You looked like you’d zoned out completely.”</p><p>“I was in shock. It was shocking.”</p><p>“Not to me. I knew this would happen. You’re getting that damn Oscar.”</p><p>Rio just laughed because how could she tell her best friend that she was far was bothered about getting the Oscar than she was about getting the girl.</p><p>A short trip to <em>another</em> red carpet later and Rio found herself back in a huge room full of glamorous people and a hell of a lot of noise.</p><p>She was lost for a while in the madness of it. She shook more hands than she could count and kissed more cheeks than she’d have liked.</p><p>And then, across the room, she saw Agatha again.</p><p>Resplendent in her white dress.</p><p>She was running her hand through her mane of wild hair, laughing politely at whatever the woman with her was saying.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>She turned her way.</p><p>The softness of Agatha’s gaze had disappeared and now she was practically eye-fucking her across the room.</p><p>And Rio decided not to just stare anymore. She <em>appreciated</em> and let Agatha know she was doing so.</p><p>Instead of the unbidden fuzziness that had settled in her chest all night, something settled lower, something hungrier, fiercer, that had appeared earlier when she’d first seen Agatha after her win. Something that made Rio want to storm across the room and show everyone exactly who Agatha belonged to.</p><p>Unable to do it, she settled for letting Agatha know what she wanted from across the room.</p><p>She moved her hand slowly up to her necklace, toying with the emerald with her fingers as she traced her tongue across her lower lip and trailed her eyes slowly over Agatha’s body.</p><p>She caught a flash of something unbidden even in the distance between them - bright blue eyes that looked suddenly dangerous and Rio felt like willing prey, exposing herself to her hunter for a quicker, but no less clean, kill.</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda’s voice brought her back to the conversation and she turned her head to smile absently, taking a sip of her wine to try to cool her racing mind.</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s gaze on her.</p><p>“You realise I’ll have to act alongside three Oscar winners?”</p><p>“What? Three?”</p><p>“When you win, obviously.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “We’re a long way away from <em>that</em>. Besides, nominations aren’t even out yet.”</p><p>“And there’s no <em>way</em> you won’t get a nom. You know that. Modesty doesn’t suit you.”</p><p>Rio grinned into her glass, “Everything suits me.”</p><p>“Don’t bring this attitude to set.”</p><p>“It’s not an attitude. It’s a personality.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and nudged their glasses together with a smirk, “Well, cheers to my arrogant wife and her spectacular win.”</p><p>Rio just laughed and took a sip of her wine, “Better up your game or I’ll act rings around you.”</p><p>“Can’t believe you get as many women as you do.”</p><p>Rio shrugged and her gaze drifted back across the room, her smile fading and softening when she saw Agatha watching her still, only half listening to whatever the people surrounding her were saying.</p><p>She quirked her brow slightly, wondering if she’d ever be able to just walk across a crowded room and kiss her.</p><p>“You know,” Wanda said in a much quieter voice, “I’ve actually been meaning to talk to you about this wife thing.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I think it would be good for us to date.”</p><p>Rio choked on her wine. Properly. Ungracefully.</p><p>She spluttered and coughed as she looked back to Wanda with wide eyes, “Pardon me?”</p><p>“Not for real, obviously. But…” and Wanda stepped closer even as Rio was patting her own chest and trying to swallow down the jagged edges in her throat. “Even being friendly with Agatha has propelled you forwards so us being seen as a power couple?”</p><p>“Wanda,” Rio started with a frown, her hand at the base of her throat and the necklace against the heel of her hand. Agatha.</p><p>“I’m not friendly with Agatha for PR.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda smiled softly and Rio sighed, seeing a slight shyness in her gaze.</p><p>“Can’t we just be friends? Without the PR?”</p><p>“It’s just a suggestion,” Wanda said with a shrug, now avoiding Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio moved in and placed a firm kiss to her cheek, smiling warmly when Wanda turned to look at her again. “I always knew you wanted to get in my pants.”</p><p>“Oh fuck off.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew as she pulled away and laughed, “Besides, you’d have to get past Alice first and I made her promise years ago she’d never make me do PR like that.”</p><p>“She’d give in for me.”</p><p>“Now who’s arrogant?”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio raised her brows and turned at the sound of the familiar voice and her smile only grew as she looked it’s the expectant eyes of her best friend.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Agatha said you needed me?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio uttered quietly, glancing up to see that Agatha was where she had been earlier but now was definitely not looking her way. “She did?”</p><p>“Just grabbed me on my way past.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and turned her attention back to Alice, “Not sure why she’d do that.” She knew exactly why.</p><p>“Wanda, wanna ask Alice your question?”</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda said so confidently that Rio looked up in surprise. “Alice, have you placed a bet on Rio winning?”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips to fight her smirk and Wanda shot her a warning look that made Rio have to bite her tongue to not laugh at.</p><p>But Alice was answering and Rio took the opportunity again to check on Agatha.</p><p>She caught her looking. But only for a second and then she was looking away and Rio felt a pang of longing run through her before she felt an arm around her shoulders and she turned to Alice.</p><p>“I can’t comment on my client’s future awards, Maximoff. Let’s just focus on this one.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and draped her arm around Alice too, wondering when Agatha had decided to send her over. Was it when Wanda made her choke? When she made her laugh? When she moved in closer? When she kissed her cheek?</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, so long as you don’t forget me when you’re at the top.”</p><p>“I’m always at the top.”</p><p>“Not from what I’ve heard.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Wanda and laughed until the redhead moved closer to kiss her cheek and whisper, “think about it.”</p><p>In alternative universe, Rio thought as she gazed into soft green eyes, Wanda would have been the better option to fall for. She was kind and funny and most importantly: not married.</p><p>But even as her hands raised to touch Rio’s cheek as she moved away Rio knew she wouldn’t ever feel for Wanda, could never feel for Wanda, the way she felt for Agatha.</p><p>Her touch didn’t set her on fire.</p><p>“No,” she promised with a gentle smile that only made Wanda roll her eyes as she went to kiss Alice’s cheek too.</p><p>“I’ll catch you both later. Don’t cause havoc.”</p><p>Alice laughed as she turned fully to Rio and gripped her arms, “So. Did you actually want me?”</p><p>“No. Agatha must have meant something else.”</p><p>Alice narrowed her eyes suspiciously but nodded and released Rio, “Fine. But let’s go schmooze. Everyone’s been asking where you are. And avoiding interrupting you and Wanda because you look so cosy.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this assessment and allowed herself to be pulled in the direction of some faces she vaguely recognised.</p><p>“Cosy?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Like…”</p><p>“Like you’re so invested in her you have no interest in anyone else.”</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder and saw Agatha watching her as Alice continued to drive them across the room.</p><p>If Alice thought Rio looked totally focused on Wanda and no one else then she couldn’t even <em>imagine</em> what Agatha thought about it.</p><p>A clammy hand was suddenly in hers though and Rio was grinning her way through more introductions and small talk.</p><p>It felt <em>good</em> to be this important all of a sudden. But being important to people whose names she’d forget by tomorrow evening wasn’t exactly the same as being important to the woman who’d disappeared through the crowds.</p><p>Still, the evening dragged on and Rio was soon in a small huddle of fellow actresses, draped over a chair with her Globe back in her hand - having let it be passed around like a joint at a frat party.</p><p>“It just doesn’t suit you,” Carol Danvers said with a smile that let Rio know she was trying to tease her.</p><p>“Looks so out of place in your hands.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’ll look better on my shelf,” Rio suggested with a smirk.</p><p>“Unsure,” Carol smiled.</p><p>“Perhaps you can put it in your bedroom,” a voice from behind Carol said and Rio looked up to see Agatha there. “Something sexy about that.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and motioned for Agatha to sit beside her but Agatha drew up a chair beside Carol instead and smiled across at Rio, as she frowned at her, getting a little sloppy with all the champagne she’d been plied with.</p><p>“I haven’t seen you all night,” Carol turned to Agatha and stole her completely from Rio and Rio couldn’t help the huff of jealousy as she watched it happen.</p><p>She kept her eyes on the two of them for a while, seeing Agatha shine her light on someone who <em>wasn’t</em> her.</p><p>But Jessica was close by and had taken it upon herself to begin bothering Rio about what she might wear to the Oscars and so Rio had no choice but to focus on her instead.</p><p>She’d finished another glass of wine by the time Agatha moved over and found that she sat closer to her than she expected. Rio’s arm had been draped over the back of the seat and Agatha squeezed in beside her, her side almost touching Rio’s front and her hand very much touching her thigh.</p><p>It felt so natural that Agatha had just sat there that Rio’s brain didn’t even short-circuit. She simply continued her conversation across her with Jessica as if Agatha had never sat there.</p><p>But Agatha’s fingers were idly toying with her dress, hidden from view as they squeezed in between them, and her head had turned to Rio and soon the pull of her gaze was too much to ignore and she turned just an inch to look at her.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Agatha removed her hand.</p><p>“Sounds like you’re planning an Oscars outfit for a winner.”</p><p>Rio moved her heavy Globe into the air and raised her brows, “Do I look like not a winner?”</p><p>“You look like you got lucky.”</p><p>Blue eyes dipped to the green gem sitting against the base of Rio’s throat and Rio smiled a little at the implication. “Oh you <em>do</em> think you had something to do with this. It’s not just Jen.”</p><p>Agatha smiled serenely and Rio narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Hey,” Jessica said, nudging Rio back into the conversation so she looked up at her again.</p><p>“I’m just going to try and find Isla. She was cornered somewhere by some exec.”</p><p>Rio waved goodbye and turned back to Agatha who’d not even blinked as their fellow actress left.</p><p>“Comfortable being close, huh?”</p><p>“Well someone else was earlier. I’m just following her lead.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched as Agatha turned from her again, brushing down her dress.</p><p>“Wanda?” Rio asked curiously, barely above a whisper.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond and Rio could only smile, because she knew Agatha so well at this point that she didn’t need to say anything.</p><p>She shifted an inch closer and dropped her voice, “Who knew you were so territorial?”</p><p>“Didn’t you ask me not to bring my husband?”</p><p>“That isn’t the same.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but Agatha was smiling at her so she couldn’t bring herself to argue the point.</p><p>“You look incredible, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha shifted, imperceptibly at first, and then so that her body was more angled to Rio and Rio realised why in an instant. Her gaze fell and she realised that Agatha was showing off for her.</p><p>She’d crossed one leg over the other and had pushed her chest out briefly and Rio took it all in. She luxuriated in the view. The soft fabric of Agatha’s white dress doing things to her she couldn’t even name, couldn’t even understand.</p><p>“You’re staring.”</p><p>“Can you blame me?”</p><p>“You know,” Agatha said quietly as she glanced around and Rio continued to stare, wondering now if anyone would notice if she simply reached out to feel the sheer fabric across Agatha’s upper thighs.</p><p>“Ever since you got up on that stage, all I’ve been able to think about is you, your award beside you, on your knees for me.”</p><p>Rio choked on nothing, and a few people nearby glanced around.</p><p>She recovered quickly but blushed a hot pink and cleared her throat, unable now to look anywhere near Agatha, let alone match her teasing gaze.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Something incredibly sexy about having the most powerful person in the room on their knees for you.”</p><p>“I-…” Rio’s eyes must be wide, must be comically so, and she looked all around them to check this wasn’t a prank of some kind or in the very least they weren’t being overheard.</p><p>“Agatha, you know I’d be on my knees for you right now if I could.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and her hand moved just the two inches it needed to until she could get a hold of the hem of Rio’s red dress.</p><p>“Would you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio looked up then, finally daring to now she had a slight hold on her breathing. Her arm across the back of the couch flexed slightly and she shifted just slightly closer and moved her trophy cautiously into Agatha’s lap and held it there, hoping she’d understand she’d give her anything.</p><p>The moment lasted longer than it should have and Rio soon found herself silently begging for Agatha to just kiss her, to just do <em>something</em> that would cure the ache in her.</p><p>But she didn’t. Her fingers remained gently curled around the hem of her dress and for now Rio had to settle for being close, being allowed at least this.</p><p>“Rio! Baby!”</p><p>Rio turned with a practiced smile that faded when she saw the person walking towards them, “Hey.”</p><p>“God, I only narrowly escaped-…” but Wanda trailed off as she sat on Rio’s other side and leant over to see Agatha there.</p><p>“Agatha, hi. I haven’t seen you all night.”</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha said with so little warmth that Rio started to mentally kick her. She pulled back a little and focused in on Wanda who looked slightly off kilter.</p><p>It always took Rio a second to remember that Agatha was softer for her and not for anyone else.</p><p>“Who did you escape?”</p><p>“That creepy guy form Paramount. Always stands too close.”</p><p>Rio hummed and pursed her lips, looking behind Wanda to check she hadn’t been followed by said creep.</p><p>But a movement beside her caught her attention back as Agatha leant around to drape her arm over Rio and rest her wrist on Wanda’s leg.</p><p>Rio stared at it, and Wanda looked down too, momentarily paralysed by Agatha’s touch.</p><p>Agatha’s left hand found its way to the back of Rio’s neck, below her hair, and what felt like her ring finger slipped below the chain of her necklace as if to anchor herself there.</p><p>It felt surreal, as if Rio were imagining the delicate touch, but Wanda’s face must have looked as surprised as her own so she knew it were happening.</p><p>If Rio turned her head, if she leant in just an inch, she could kiss Agatha’s cheek, or swipe her tongue along the angle of her jaw, or nuzzle into her hair.</p><p>But she did none of those things.</p><p>“Tell me,” Agatha began to say.</p><p>And then Wanda’s hand was on her knee and Rio didn’t know if it was intentional or whether Wanda were just drunk and affectionate. But she thought it would be out of character for Wanda to try to challenge Agatha.</p><p>Wanda leant in too.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers flexed against the back of her neck but she made no other movement to suggest she’d even noticed Wanda’s hand now against Rio’s skin and instead continued her line of questioning.</p><p>“You’re still with UTA?”</p><p>Wanda nodded and said, “Yeah. Have had the same agent for years now. And you? With Jen?”</p><p>Rio felt claustrophobic and like she was gnawing on the bars of her enclosure all at once.</p><p>Agatha was pressed against her, so close that Rio was feeling hot again. Her hand was still curled around her neck, her finger looped around her necklace, and her body was pressed against her as much as it could be.</p><p>But her attention was on Wanda so Rio was left with nothing. She watched the workings of Agatha’s face, her profile still so close to Rio that she could count each freckle, the goddess that had done Agatha’s makeup had left them visible and Rio wanted to kiss her for it.</p><p>Just not as much as she wanted to kiss Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha turned slightly, slowly, and Rio saw the four freckles that haunted her thoughts because they were so precious, so delicious, so hers.</p><p>“Isn’t that right?”</p><p>Rio blinked, dropping her gaze from the freckles on Agatha’s nose to the lips that had just formed the question she was now expected to answer.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Alice is desperate to get us to work together.”</p><p>“Oh. Yes. Desperate.”</p><p>But a hand reached up between them and Rio found her head being turned to the side and her gaze was torn from Agatha. She felt fingers flex against the back of her neck as Wanda turned her to look over.</p><p>They were a tangle of limbs now.</p><p>To any unobservant outsider they were just a gaggle of women bending into one another to gossip. Three actresses leaning into each other, chatting about nothing.</p><p>Wanda was holding Rio’s cheek. Agatha’s arm was still across Rio with her wrist on Wanda. Her left hand was still against Rio’s neck. Rio’s hand holding her Globe was resting in Agatha’s lap, and still, warm and heavy against her, sat Wanda’s other hand on her knee.</p><p>“What’ll our little Christmas movie be? Twice now?”</p><p>“First didn’t count,” Rio said, half in the conversation and half now distracted by the thumb brushing small circles on her neck. “We barely had any scenes.”</p><p>“Well now we’ll be in almost every scene together. Christmas wives.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers flexed.</p><p>“Christmas wives,” Rio repeated because it was easier than coming up with something herself.</p><p>“They wanted me for your role,” Agatha said, her tone still light, but Rio heard the pointedness of it as she broke Wanda’s hold and turned to her.</p><p>“But that was before Rio was attached.”</p><p>“Oh? I didn’t know that.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and dropped her gaze to where Wanda’s hand was against Rio’s leg for the first time. From this angle Rio couldn’t see her face anymore but her thumb had stopped moving against her neck.</p><p>“Second choice,” Agatha said as she turned back to Wanda and Wanda raised her brows, shocked by the insult. She pulled her hand back from Rio’s leg.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said quietly, making Agatha turn to her and arch a brow.</p><p>“It’s a good role,” Wanda was saying, missing the look exchanged between Rio and Agatha and none the wiser that Agatha was now toying with the chain of Rio’s necklace where it sat at the back of her neck.</p><p>“It might not look much, might look like just playing happy families but… and now Rio’s on board and we’re playing a lesbian couple with a kid. It’ll mean something to people.”</p><p>Agatha had looked away from Rio and Rio fell back into the struggle against temptation to <em>not</em> bite at her jaw.</p><p>“Sweet,” she said dismissively and tapped her finger on Wanda’s leg before she pulled slowly back and squeezed Rio’s knee where Wanda had just been holding her.</p><p>“I heard you might have scheduling conflicts.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, turning curiously to Wanda, “You do?”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda came back to herself, waving her hand absently, “Only last week my agent got a call about some reshoots needing done around the same time. Something about not being able to get the studio space later in the year for them. They’re working on it though it won’t be a problem.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and felt Agatha pull away from beside her.</p><p>The Hollywood version of a game of Twister had ended.</p><p>And Rio wanted to spin the board again, but Agatha had pulled her hand away from her neck and the only thing now anchoring them were their thighs pressed together and Rio’s award resting in Agatha’s lap.</p><p>“How did you know about the scheduling issue?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look around at Rio’s question and leant forward to pick up her champagne.</p><p>“It’s a small business in a small town. People talk.”</p><p>Rio watched her for a while, lost in her own mind until Wanda pulled her back. She was kissing her cheek, squeezing her knee again.</p><p>“I’m going to go mingle. I’ll catch you on the dance floor later?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio managed a smile and watched as Wanda shot Agatha a quick smile before she left, glancing over her shoulder at them both as she did.</p><p>“You could be nicer,” Rio said from the side of her mouth, moving her award back into her own lap.</p><p>Her other arm was still along the back of the seat, still so close to Agatha.</p><p>“She wants you,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>“We’re friends.”</p><p>“Unfortunately for her.”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek and glanced around to ensure no one would overhear when she said: “Jealous?”</p><p>Agatha turned to her then. Eyes so bright they were like kindling to Rio’s tortured heart.</p><p>“The necklace looks good on you,” Agatha said quietly and Rio knew she was giving her an answer without saying it and Rio wanted to kiss her for it.</p><p>“You’re pleased I’m wearing it?”</p><p>“Mm,” was all Agatha managed before they were descended upon by fellow partygoers.</p><p>Agatha put more distance between them then and leant away from Rio to engage someone else and Rio dutifully gave the director now talking to her her full attention.</p><p>Her award was back in her lap but her mind was elsewhere.</p><p>In any just world they’d have been a couple, able to lean into one another, able to kiss and touch and it not be a big deal.</p><p>But now Agatha was inches away from her on the couch and it would have been odd if Rio reached back out to her just to touch her.</p><p>The torture of being so close and yet so far could only last until Jen arrived at the scene to remove her client. Agatha barely turned to Rio, barely said goodbye, and then she was whisked off and Rio was left to fend for herself in a shark-infested pool of producers.</p><p>Alice soon took on Jen’s earlier role and came to rescue Rio and she found herself deposited in a much friendlier sphere of her fellow actors and then soon in amongst them on the dance floor.</p><p>Wanda was back again, back close, back encouraging her to enjoy and laugh and sing.</p><p>It felt good to have someone want to be close and not be scared by it. For that person to not pull away. For that person to actively be smiling for any camera that came past when their arms were around her.</p><p>Though Rio kept sweeping the room for Agatha, wondering if soon she’d feel her press against her, if soon she’d feel the music through Agatha’s body rather than someone else’s.</p><p>As her Golden Globe got passed around in a magnanimous and selfish move (it was getting too heavy to be constantly held), Rio spotted her through an opening in the crowd.</p><p>The most famous woman in the world was sitting with her manager and several Hollywood heavy hitters.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>She looked lonely.</p><p>Her eyes were no longer teasing or seductive. They were instead wide, soft, <em>devastated</em>.</p><p>Rio pulled from Wanda, pushed off clawing hands of her fellow dancers, intent on making sure Agatha never had to look that way again or feel the way she must be feeling.</p><p>She wanted to kiss it away, to press herself close enough that Agatha only saw and felt her and wouldn’t have to dwell in whatever she wouldn’t let Rio see. In that moment she felt like she could give everything. She felt like being close would cure Agatha of whatever ailed her.</p><p>Almost out of the sea of writhing bodies, Rio had her eyes on Agatha so missed the man approaching from the side. He blocked her view and Rio was polite enough to beg his excusal but not fast enough to see where Agatha had gone when she slipped past him.</p><p>She stood, staring at the place she’d been until hands and arms were around her again and she was pulled back into the throng to celebrate her win and to be celebrated in equal measure.</p><p>Hands and arms and willing smiles pulled her back onto the dance floor.</p><p>The music throbbed and the people around her buoyed her into existence, let alone the mood to dance. And she twisted and curled and jumped and screamed with everyone else.</p><p>Only she was the only one half there. The rest of her was wherever Agatha was.</p><p>An hour or so later Alice had found her again and was ushering her to their waiting car, whispering something about “leaving on a high”.</p><p>Their SUV was waiting and Rio clambered in, a little sweatier than when she’d arrived.</p><p>Her head was on the window and the gentle vibrations of the vehicle were soothing her when Alice spoke up.</p><p>“I was watching you with Agatha tonight.”</p><p>Focusing on the lights, Rio could almost control her heart rate.</p><p>“I think we should work the relationship with Wanda more. For the movie. For your future.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Listen to me. You’re pining. I can see it now. Having someone else to focus your smiles and effort on… it’ll help. Plus Wanda’s a friend. She’ll have you. It’ll be easy.”</p><p>“No, Alice.”</p><p>“You don’t even have to do anything. Just hang out. We’ll call some paps. Besides, Wanda mentioned it earlier. She wants to do it.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I told you when we started all this; I’m not doing anything like that. I don’t care about it enough to lie.”</p><p>“She’s your friend. It’s not a-…”</p><p>“Alice, please.”</p><p>“I’m trying to help you. Agatha is… it’ll never happen, Rio. You need to move on. If I can’t make you date then I can at least make you fake it.”</p><p>“You can’t make me do anything.”</p><p>“I know. Just think about it.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as the flashing lights began to blur into one.</p><p>It was the last thing she remembered when she woke the next day, in her pyjamas, alone in her bed.</p>

What a dream.</em></p></blockquote><p>Agatha’s post got twelve million likes.</p><p>Agatha’s text came in thirty seconds after the nominations were read out and Rio had, for the first time in her life, been focused on her phone during the announcement. She’d hoped Agatha would contact her.</p><p>1:02pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Baby’s first nomination.</p><p>1:03pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: 4 really is greedy</p><p>1:05pm<br/>
Agatha Vidal: It’s on my jersey, honey. You predicted it yourself.</p><p>1:05pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Should have put 69 on there</p><p>1:27pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Should have.</p><p>1:27pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: Come over. I have maybe ten minutes of time that Alice hasn’t booked out. I’ll shake Alice off and we can celebrate.</p><p>1:28pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: You think Jen isn’t keeping me just as busy?</p><p>1:28pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: I miss you.</p><p>Rio had arrived home to a bouquet of flowers with a note: <em>Rio, So deserved. Agatha.</em></p><p>The bouquet was the biggest and most beautiful of the others that had arrived and filled the ground floor of Rio’s little villa. Or maybe Rio was just that in love.</p><p>Rio had sent Agatha a bouquet of mostly purple flowers. She’d arranged it days ago, knowing there was no chance she wouldn’t be nominated. And her note had read:</p><p><em>‘Agatha,<br/>
Estoy de rodillas por ti.<br/>
Rio x’</em></p><p>The Oscar nominations came out not long after the BAFTAs and the SAGs.</p><p>Both Rio and Agatha got into all three.</p><p>Wanda got into two; missing the SAG.</p><p>Rio’s feet didn’t touch the floor.</p><p>And Alice hadn’t given her a second to breathe. She’d been on her all day every day.</p><p>So much so that she didn’t know what day it was or where she was at any given moment. But she got through. With the help of coffee and an internal countdown to when she could see Agatha again.</p><p>She’d tried to call her a handful of times since the Globes but had only ever reached her voicemail and occasionally received a text an hour later apologising or telling her she was busy or she couldn’t talk now.</p><p>Rio missed her endlessly during this period.</p><p>The only respite she’d had in all this time was the flight over to London. Alice was fast asleep in her little cubby and so Rio had peace for the first time.</p><p>She drank red wine and watched all the movies she hadn’t watched in months because she’d had no time and no energy.</p><p>But Rio didn’t sleep.</p><p>Because she knew who she was seeing just hours after they touched down at Heathrow.</p><p>After the Globes the internet had been abuzz with excitement over the awards race hotting up. But a large and vocal majority had focused more on the photos that emerged <em>after</em> the awards had gone out.</p><p>Pictures appeared everywhere from TMZ to fan accounts online of the three way tête-à-tête between Rio, Wanda, and Agatha. Rumours began circulating that Rio and Wanda were now an item, and Agatha more of a vocal ally than she’d ever appeared to be before.</p><p>Wanda had used this newfound interest in her and Rio to try and convince her friend they should play into it but so far Rio hadn’t budged. Even with Alice on Wanda’s side.</p><p>Rio hadn’t heard from Agatha much during this time; at least not since the texts after the Oscar nominations came out. She relied instead on a steady stream of updates from Alice. And that’s how she found out that they’d all be arriving the same day in London, that Agatha was bringing Ralph and Nicky, and that a dinner at the Chiltern Firehouse had been booked for the day they arrived.</p><p>But according to Alice - again, via Jen - she was just as busy as Rio was. Only Agatha was also juggling Nicky. Which was the reason Nicky was coming to London. Alongside his father and his nanny.</p><p>Though thoughts of seeing the shy little boy did calm her rising disgust at having to spend at least two evenings watching Ralph with Agatha, most of Rio’s nervous energy was still focused on the man she’d now decided she hated with almost as much passion as she loved his wife.</p><p>She’d seen pictures of him and Agatha online in the time between the Globes and now.</p><p>Carefully planned by Jen, she had to assume.</p><p>And on one particularly terrible day she’d got high and googled photos of their wedding. She’d stared at images of Agatha’s best Hollywood smile in a Ralph Lauren gown and felt sick with jealousy and then become paranoid that she’d somehow been caught looking at the photos in public. Though she was home alone. She’d decided never to touch that particular strain again.</p><p>But with Ralph still came Agatha. And Rio wanted more than anything to see her again, to be in her presence, to perhaps be able to touch her.</p><p>By the time they landed in Heathrow, Rio had had the majority of a bottle of red and was feeling a little better about their plans for the evening.</p><p>Though she was <em>exhausted</em>.</p><p>London was cold. Even for London. And Rio, now styled to the nines wherever she went, had a thick woollen coat to wrap herself in as someone took her bags for her and she and Alice were led through Arrivals, hurried through passport control, and out to a waiting car.</p><p>There were some paps, some fans, and Rio stopped for the latter but did her best to ignore the former.</p><p>“Doing good, Rio. Doing good.”</p><p>Alice was always there to reassure, always hovering even when the youngest and littlest of fans approached.</p><p>And Rio was pleased to have her back on side again.</p><p>Doing all this without her would have been untenable. But she’d shared a small piece of her struggle with her best friend now, which helped dull the pain, even if it didn’t eradicate it entirely.</p><p>“Two hours to shower and change and then we need to leave for dinner,” Alice said absently as she tapped away at her phone, no doubt responding to journalists as they whisked through the traffic to their hotel.</p><p>“I think I’ll soak in the bath,” Rio said, watching Alice with a small smile. “Maybe shoot up some heroin and kill some puppies.”</p><p>“Yeah, good idea.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and snatched Alice’s phone from her hands.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“You’re doing it again!”</p><p>Through the windscreen mirror their driver looked back at them and saw a very tiny woman scrabbling to wrestle with a movie star. He averted his gaze; anything other than driving to and from the assigned destination was above his pay grade.</p><p>Rio was laughing now, and relented, but only because Alice was going a little pink at the ears from her efforts and she was beginning to feel bad.</p><p>“I’m trying to keep your career afloat.”</p><p>“Oh my sinking career? My Oscar nomination not good enough?”</p><p>Alice looked up with a scowl at her grinning best friend and huffed as she returned back to her seat. “Do you know how many emails I get a day? Not to mention your socials. It’s exhausting and I don’t think-…”</p><p>“I know, I know. You organise and I show up. I get it. I’m teasing.”</p><p>“You’re giddy. And I know why.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded a little and Alice met her with a steady gaze. “It’s been a couple weeks, that’s all. Which is why I think that-…”</p><p>“Don’t even say it.”</p><p>“She makes a good argument, Rio. The amount of press the three of you got from just those pictures. Her hand on your cheek almost broke the internet.”</p><p>Rio sighed and began to toy with her hair, “It’s not something I want to do.”</p><p>“Wanda wants it. And it’ll be good for the movie.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and turned to look out the window, “I’m not doing it, Alice. She’s my friend and people can write what they want about us online but I’m not playing up to it.”</p><p>“You do look hot together though.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Rio said with a huff and blindly slapped at Alice’s arm as she kept her gaze out the window.</p><p>“Apparently the kid’s excited to see you,” Alice said, returning her attention back to her phone. Rio bit her lip and shot a glance at her distracted best friend.</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“Jen said.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>Alice sighed and placed her phone down in her lap to focus properly on Rio. “Agatha told Jen and Jen told me.”</p><p>“When.”</p><p>“Maybe a week ago.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you say?”</p><p>“Rio, a lot of people are excited to see you. I forget.”</p><p>“This is Agatha’s kid, Alice. How could you forget?”</p><p>Alice blinked and Rio realised how pathetic she must have sounded. Especially to the ears of someone who had no idea of the depth of Rio’s true feelings, of what complicated situation she’d entangled herself in with Agatha.</p><p>“I just… I’m sorry. It wasn’t intentional.”</p><p>Rio turned away again, and they were both silent for the rest of the drive. Alice had returned to her emails and Rio returned to her pining. Neither was very happy about it.</p><p>They arrived at the Ritz just as the rain began. Rio was protected by a large golfing umbrella and she had to bundle Alice in beneath her arm to make sure she kept out of the rain too.</p><p>There was a lone photographer who’d braved the weather to snap photos of whatever stars were arriving for the BAFTAs and staying in the infamous hotel near the palace and Rio missed his shout over the wind: “Here to see Agatha?”</p><p>Check-in was easy, and Alice handled most of it, even providing Rio’s passport as she held back, keeping her eyes on the large and supercilious lobby around her in case Agatha happened to be loitering around one of the randomly placed chaises anywhere nearby.</p><p>But she wasn’t.</p><p>And Rio was almost relieved. She needed some time to relax before she faced Agatha. Especially before she faced her with Ralph on her arm.</p><p>She took the bath she’d told Alice she’d take once she got to her room - minus the heroin and canicide. And she stayed in it until the very last second, giving herself just twenty minutes to change before she knew Alice would be banging down her door.</p><p>Drying herself she put on a cotton-soft white t-shirt and a thick argyle sweater vest and straight cut blue jeans with black heeled boots. It was casual, and warm, and she applied just a base layer of makeup with mascara and a nude lipstick before she grabbed her jacket and bag and waited obediently for Alice to arrive.</p><p>Alice had dressed a little fancier than Rio with a new shade of lipstick to boot but Rio didn’t comment other than to say she looked good and Jen would be beside herself.</p><p>They made their way to the restaurant in the same chauffeured car and Rio began to feel more and more nervous as the minutes went by and she found that she’d reached for Alice’s hand, which was originally met with resistance as Alice continued to try and work but she soon gave in upon seeing Rio’s pale face.</p><p>For the two weeks between the Golden Globes and the journey to the restaurant, Rio had thought every day of the look in Agatha’s eyes the last time she’d seen her.</p><p>Those eyes haunted her. Because it was Agatha at her most unguarded. Agatha telling her how she felt. Agatha who was usually so unreachable suddenly out in the open.</p><p>And Rio knew it was because Agatha felt trapped. So she waited. Quietly. Patiently. Hoping Agatha might be ready.</p><p>The situation outside the restaurant was a little different to the one outside the hotel. There were more paps, more cameras locked and loaded, and Rio guessed Agatha’s presence had already been let slip to the bastards holding them.</p><p>Rio and Alice made their way in with only a little fuss, keeping their heads down and their faces as neutral as possible and when they got out of the rain and into the warm embrace of the building, Rio released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding.</p><p>They shrugged off their jackets and the concierge showed them to the table in the busy restaurant and Rio locked eyes with the woman she’d thought of almost every second of her busy days.</p><p>This Agatha was dressed down from the last time she saw her.</p><p>She wore a deep brown knit jumper, dark jeans, dark boots. She was standing to greet them. She was looking at Rio. She was smiling. She was reaching for her and Rio was back in her arms for the first time in what felt like forever.</p><p>Rio could breathe again.</p><p>“Hey,” she said quietly, coolly, as if hugging Agatha meant nothing to her, as if the squeeze around her shoulders was nothing and her own arms that squeezed Agatha’s waist were so used to it that it meant as little as if Agatha were anyone, and not Rio’s constant obsession.</p><p>But Agatha was moving on before she even said anything and Rio was left with a rush of cold air as Agatha pulled away only to be replaced by Jen two seconds later.</p><p>“Ah the golden girl has arrived,” Jen said close to Rio’s ear but gave her a quick squeeze all the same.</p><p>“Lovely to see you too, Jennifer.”</p><p>Rio pulled away with a small smile then and turned to the little boy standing just beside his mother, smiling goofily up at her.</p><p>“Hey, kid,” Rio said warmly, able to brush aside her desire to wrap her arms around Agatha again as she caught Nicky’s eyes.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Alice mumbled from somewhere behind her as Rio moved to give Nicky a hug. “I mean, holy shit. It’s way clearer in person.”</p><p>Rio hummed as Nicky said a slightly muffled “hi Rio” and she kissed the top of his head, briefly catching Agatha’s eyes as she released him and straightened out. To her surprise it was then that Agatha spoke to her, a barely whispered “hi” that made Rio blush where she stood.</p><p>“No one’s gonna comment on this?”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said softly as she turned to her friend and saw what she assumed would be happening.</p><p>Alice was staring at Nicky now back at Agatha’s side, now holding her hand and looking serious.</p><p>“Babe,” Jen said quickly, tugging Alice to sit down at her side, “How was your flight?”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and turned to the next person she was yet to greet and smiled tightly at Ralph as he raised his glass to her, but didn’t get up, “Rio. Congrats on the nomination.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha moved past her and Rio felt the unmistakeable brush of a hand along her lower back and she was shocked into movement because of it and took a seat next to Nicky, the only seat now available at the table.</p><p>In their little table of six Rio had the undeniable pleasure of being as far from Ralph as possible. He sat opposite Agatha, on the opposite side, and Rio was pleased that he, and now Jen and Alice, were on the outside of the table, where she with Nicky and Agatha, had the booth side.</p><p>Though she’d assumed this had been Agatha’s choice and not Ralph being gentlemanly.</p><p>Before conversation could be picked up again, Rio felt a light kick to her shin and she looked up to see Alice making eyes at her and motioning with her head to Nicky. Rio cleared her throat in warning but said nothing, hoping Alice would drop it for fear she’d upset the boy.</p><p>Let alone Ralph.</p><p>“So,” Ralph said as if this were his table to command, as if everyone were hanging on his every word.</p><p>“How was the flight?”</p><p>Nicky fidgeted a little beside Rio and Rio glanced over to see he was toying with the menu on the table and another glance told her the reason for that: Alice was staring at him.</p><p>She kicked Alice much harder than Alice had kicked her.</p><p>“Ow, fuck!”</p><p>Rio shot her a look and Alice mumbled, “Sorry,” and had the humility to look ashamed of herself.</p><p>“The flight was fine. Long. How was yours?” Rio prided herself on being able to maintain a conversation, even if it were with a prick.</p><p>“Well, same length as yours,” Ralph said with a grin that Rio was sure would have floored any woman with even an inkling of attraction to men.</p><p>God, Rio hated him.</p><p>“Nicky and I watched movies, didn’t we honey?” Rio turned slowly from where she’d been smiling falsely at Ralph to look at Agatha whose arm she was thrilled to notice was along the back of the booth just inches from her shoulder.</p><p>She settled back a little and wished she could lean in to see if Agatha would touch her. She just about managed to hold herself back from it.</p><p>“Nevermind that,” Jen said with a wave of her hand that acted as a flyswatter on the conversation. “I want to talk tomorrow night: the two of you. Preferably without Wanda. Candids. We’re going to make it happen.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to Alice to see her reaction to this and saw her best friend beaming in surprise at her girlfriend.</p><p>“Seriously?!”</p><p>Jen huffed.</p><p>Alice practically squealed.</p><p>Agatha had leant over to nudge Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Ralph knocked back his whiskey and clicked for a waiter to bring another.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you?” Agatha asked with a smirk as Rio turned to her, unable to stop thinking about the fact that Agatha’s hand was still on her.</p><p>“Jen’s changed her mind about you.”</p><p>“It’s temporary,” Jen was now pointing at Rio across the table, narrowing her gaze at her even as Agatha squeezed her shoulder and Alice continued to grin.</p><p>“Only because we’re controlling the narrative.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio shot a quick glance at Agatha but relaxed when she saw she looked amused rather than worried.</p><p>“The narrative that suggests that it’s pretty damn good for Agatha to be friends with an up and coming lesbian. It took me a while to get here but-…”</p><p>“An ‘up and coming lesbian’ makes it sound like Rio’s just worked out what her fingers do.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Alice glanced at Nicky who seemed both nonplussed and a little confused, “Sorry.”</p><p>“Actress, whatever. Gay actress.”</p><p>“Can we not. Nicky’s here.”</p><p>Four sets of eyes swivelled to Ralph and Rio wanted to jam her knife into his throat.</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away from her.</p><p>“Look,” Jen said, her hands raised and her gaze briefly on Agatha as if assessing the danger levels already. “It’s just until the Oscars are over. A few nice shots. Get some social kudos and then we’ll be done.”</p><p>“Is that right?” Rio asked a little more harshly than she meant to, her mind shooting daggers at the man now not thanking the waiter for delivering his drink.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio. This is what you wanted.”</p><p>“It’s what <em>Alice</em> wanted. I don’t do PR relationships.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Agatha asked suddenly, watching Rio with a frown, her arm now draped over Nicky’s shoulders.</p><p>“Are we ready to order drinks?”</p><p>The waiter had arrived and saved Rio’s life. Rio cleared her throat and just as she was about to reach for the drinks menu Ralph spoke again: “Oh a Pinto Noir for this one.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw almost came off its hinges and she stared across at the man now smirking at her, his fucking pinky raised as he sipped his fucking drink.</p><p>If Nicky hadn’t been beside her she’d have launched herself at him. But a foot was nudging her ankle and she tore her gaze from him to Alice as Jen, clearly also having decided to ignore Ralph, gave her order.</p><p>Alice just shook her head a little and Rio dropped her gaze to her menu, her teeth clenched so tightly in her mouth she thought she’d never be able to open it again.</p><p>“Rio will have the Barolo. Actually, make it a bottle. I’ll have it too. And a coke.”</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge Agatha ordering for her but she did look back up to Ralph and saw him watching her still and she felt like was going to explode from the look on his face.</p><p>He hated her, that much she could tell.</p><p>But he also looked smug, like he’d won something over on her.</p><p>She shut her menu.</p><p>“Sauvignon for me please,” Alice said after clearing her throat quietly.</p><p>The waiter nodded and Rio stood as he left, “Excuse me, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>She grabbed her purse and strode away as quickly as she could, desperate to have a second to breathe away from Agatha’s husband.</p><p>Only when in the bathroom did she slam her purse down and run her fingers through her hair and released the frustration by washing her hands in freezing cold water.</p><p>So intent on freezing her fingers off, she didn’t register the presence of a woman behind her.</p><p>“Rio Vidal?”</p><p>Rio jumped and smacked her thumb on the underside of the spout and grimaced out a “fuck!” as she ripped her hand up and cradled it. “Shit.”</p><p>“Here,” the woman moved forwards and took Rio’s wet hands in her own and Rio winced from the sharp pain in her thumb and the embarrassment of the situation.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” the woman murmured, and Rio shrugged a little, watching as her hand was turned over and the woman inspected her thumb that looked no worse for having just been smacked against the sharp edge of a very hefty metal tap.</p><p>“It’s okay. My fault.”</p><p>“Can you move it?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and looked up then, sucking in a sharp breath when she saw the eyes of the woman now gently rubbing over her damp, sore thumb.</p><p>She was ridiculous looking. Like some kind of model. Some kind of gorgeous, better than other people, kind of model.</p><p>“I, yes, I can move it.”</p><p>Rio twitched her thumb beneath the woman’s hold and was graced with a a brilliant smile and Rio reflected it right back at her, momentarily stupefied by it.</p><p>It had been weeks since she’d so much as looked at anyone who wasn’t Agatha.</p><p>As if an alarm had gone off to tell Agatha that Rio was looking at another woman, she appeared in the bathroom suddenly. Rio missed the door opening, and only knew Agatha had arrived when she heard her name.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>And the wind was knocked out of her sails because a model was holding her hand and smiling at her but Agatha was there, she’d come looking, and Rio felt the pang of yearning more sharply than she’d felt her knuckle whack the metal.</p><p>Agatha was better than any model.</p><p>She turned to Agatha and saw that she was staring intently at where Rio’s hands were still being held.</p><p>“Jesus. Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed up to look at the woman in front of Rio and Rio worried for this girl suddenly at the look on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“And you are?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip as Agatha <em>The Ice Queen</em> Harkness stared this woman down.</p><p>“Felicity,” the woman said with that same dazzling grin that had worked on Rio but was decidedly <em>not</em> working on Agatha.</p><p>Rio pulled her hands away gently and the woman turned back to her with raised brows, reaching back out for Rio’s injured hand. From the corner of her eye, Rio saw Agatha move over.</p><p>“I’m fine, really.”</p><p>But Agatha was taking her hand away from the woman’s hold and cradling it gently in her own, turning it over to see where Rio had injured herself.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said softly, releasing an embarrassed huff even as the gentleness of Agatha’s touch made her whole body warm.</p><p>“She smacked her hand on the tap,” the woman said in a crisp English accent even as Agatha moved between them and blocked the stranger from Rio.</p><p>“It’s really fine,” Rio protested, shooting the woman a small smile before she returned her attention to Agatha who was now gently pressing on the bend of her thumb, kneading it until she found the: “ah!”</p><p>“It’s not fine,” Agatha concluded with a frown, shooting Rio a look before returning her attention back to her hand.</p><p>“Is there anything I can do?”</p><p>The poor woman moved around to stand beside the two actresses and Rio felt suddenly sorry for her. “No, thank you though. Really, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Well, maybe I could just get your number instead? Check in on your hand a little later?”</p><p>Agatha looked up, and Rio bit her tongue.</p><p>“I’m actually seeing someone,” Rio managed to get out, trying incredibly hard not to look at Agatha, not to see just how mad she was.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“Damn. Okay, maybe you could just take it if it-…”</p><p>“She said no,” Agatha snapped suddenly, giving Rio the excuse to turn to look at her and she saw something glorious, something miraculous: Agatha was jealous.</p><p>No, Agatha was homicidal.</p><p>Rio swallowed down the urge to kiss her murderous face and turned back to the woman with an apologetic look, or one that she hoped was, at least.</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>The woman only smiled, shot Agatha a quick glance, and then grabbed her bag and left without even using the facilities she’d presumably come in here to use in the first place.</p><p>Only when they were alone again did Rio turn back to Agatha and saw that she looked no less furious. But the hold on her hand was still gentle, and Rio stepped a little closer as she said: “You okay in there?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said quietly, clearing her throat as she leant around to turn on the water, running it over her fingers until it was warm, and then gently placing Rio’s thumb under it. “It’ll probably bruise, but it doesn’t feel broken.”</p><p>“Thank you, Dr Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and Rio turned her hand over under the running water to lock her fingers with Agatha, proving her thumb was fine by rubbing it gently over Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha didn’t do anything but let it happen and Rio was left to watch her clench and unclench her jaw as she worked through whatever she was thinking.</p><p>“Seeing someone?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re seeing someone?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and studied Agatha for a second, waiting for her to look up at her, and she did.</p><p>In the split second between looking furious still, staring at the water with blind rage, and looking up at Rio, her eyes became as soft as her touch.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio breathed out softly, taking a step closer just as the door swung open and they were no longer alone.</p><p>Agatha had stepped back, dropped Rio’s hand, and turned away to face the mirror.</p><p>She cleared her throat and reached for a cloth to hand to Rio, “We should get back.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered as her fingers curled slowly around the cloth offered to her. It was soft in her hand, but nothing to the delicate touches of Agatha a second ago.</p><p>“Not here,” Agatha breathed out, her fingers briefly making contact on the knitted vest Rio wore before she pulled back completely and made for the door.</p><p>Rio followed behind like lost kitten after tossing the cloth into the waiting basket.</p><p>It felt cruel, this obvious and visceral show from Agatha that she wanted her and then the immediate pull away, the knowledge that they couldn’t act on their feelings. And Rio approached the table again with a heaviness in her chest made only worse when she saw the back of Ralph’s stupid head.</p><p>Nicky looked up and smiled when she approached the bench and some of the heaviness lifted.</p><p>“All okay?” Alice asked with raised brows and Rio looked up and smiled tightly, “I hit my hand on the faucet. Agatha caught me and-…”</p><p>“Caught her flirting,” Agatha said and Rio turned sharply to her, feeling all eyes swivel not to her, but to Agatha, even as she kept her gaze on a tight jaw.</p><p>“I wasn’t-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said in a softer, almost amused tone, “You hurt your hand because you were flirting?”</p><p>“Jesus, I hope you didn’t try anything in the bathroom like you did on the beach,” Jen added with a smirk. “I’ll rescind my offer of having access to Agatha if you-…”</p><p>“I didn’t,” Rio cut in sharply, less annoyed by Agatha thinking she was flirting than by Jen accusing her of shagging someone in the bathroom.</p><p>“Good,” Jen said as she sipped her newly-arrived wine.</p><p>“What happened on the beach?”</p><p>Rio looked away from Ralph and took a sip of her own wine as Agatha said: “Rio made a new friend. Friendly gal.”</p><p>“She is,” Nicky said quietly and Rio turned to smile down at him and nudged his shoulder gently.</p><p>“Anyway,” Alice was saying quickly to recover the conversation, “We should talk about something infinitely more interesting than Rio’s… friendliness.”</p><p>Rio shot her best friend a grateful smile and then settled back into the bench. She flexed her thumb and brushed her fingers over where she knew a bruise would soon blossom and saw a small hand reach for it too.</p><p>“Does it hurt?”</p><p>“A little.”</p><p>“Did mama kiss it better? That helps.”</p><p>Rio looked up and saw Agatha watching her and Nicky from the corner of her eye as Alice and Jen engaged Ralph in some shop talk.</p><p>“No. I think magic kisses only work when they’re given right away.”</p><p>Nicky hummed seriously as if mulling over the rules and regulations of the healing powers of magic kisses and then nodded and Rio shot him a smile as she asked, “Won any more championships since I last saw you?”</p><p>“No. I have scored a few times though.”</p><p>“Yeah? Of course you have! Best player on the team.”</p><p>“You know,” Agatha said as she leant into Nicky and Rio couldn’t help but lean in a little too. “Maybe now’s a good time to ask Rio your question, honey.”</p><p>“Oh,” Nicky said and shuffled around to look at Rio properly, “Mama said you’d come play again soon. Will you? Please?”</p><p>Rio chewed her lip and her eyes darted briefly up to Agatha who was purposefully not looking her way and she nodded as her gaze turned back to Nicky.</p><p>“Yes. Yes I’d love to.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Agatha wrapped an arm around him and pulled him closer into her side, but Rio caught it, just briefly, she’d looked her way.</p><p>They locked eyes for only a second and Agatha let her in. She let her see how badly she felt, how desperate she was, and how this was killing her as much as it was killing Rio.</p><p>And suddenly the dull ache in her thumb meant nothing, the arrows slung her way when Agatha was jealous were soft caresses compared to this. Because this felt like she were being run over repeatedly by a truck.</p><p>So Rio turned away.</p><p>She took up her wine and focused on not reaching out and causing a scene; on not breaking up a marriage in the most public, but fastest way possible.</p><p>“Rio,” Rio looked up when she heard her name from the lips of public enemy number one.</p><p>She wished she hadn’t.</p><p>Ralph’s hand was outstretched towards Agatha, his fingers splayed out, expectant.</p><p>Agatha’s left hand, ringless, was toying with the stem of her glass.</p><p>“I hope you’re not putting false ideas into my son’s head about which team to support.”</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t taken his hand.</p><p>Nicky shifted beside her.</p><p>“Not this again,” Jen said with a roll of her eyes, swirling her glass where she looked between them, her gaze briefly flickering down to Ralph’s hand. “Heard enough about Nicky’s basketball team to last a lifetime.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and sat back again, her eyes drifting back to Ralph’s hand and making sure he saw it before she looked up again.</p><p>“Actually we’ve agreed I’ll come over soon to play ball.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>Ralph pulled his hand back and Rio felt a flash of triumph deep within her chest. Agatha would take her hand.</p><p>“Perhaps I’ll check my schedule and I can-…”</p><p>“No daddy.”</p><p>Rio and Agatha looked at the same time down at the little boy with a big frown and Rio felt sick with the prospect of it. Of Nicky looking distressed, of Agatha pulling him closer as she leant back a little and her chin raised to Ralph.</p><p>“I think maybe the Celtics fans should stick together.”</p><p>Rio shot a look at Alice and saw something turning in her brain, her brow furrowed, her fingers curling and uncurling around the cup of her wine.</p><p>And Jen beside her was watching Agatha like a hawk, her jaw tight as she waited for the retort from the Bulls fan beside her.</p><p>“Fine. Wouldn’t look good to destroy a girl on the court anyway.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the scoff that left her mouth then, and she became defensive, cocky, as she turned her body and raised her arm over the back of the bench.</p><p>“Oh you think-…?”</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said quickly, but it wasn’t Rio she was speaking to. She reached out to Ralph and simultaneously stabbed Rio in the heart.</p><p>Alice was kicking Rio under the table so much that Rio could only imagine the bruises that would be blossoming by morning.</p><p>“Maybe let’s leave the basketball talk for now.”</p><p>And Ralph took Agatha’s hand and Rio had to look away again, had to tuck her legs beneath the bench so Alice couldn’t reach her, had to remove her arm from the back of the seat and drink down her full glass of red.</p><p>The conversation moved on but Rio didn’t.</p><p>Her gaze remained down for most of the meal, and she spoke only when spoken to or when Alice managed to kick her shin or nudge her hand.</p><p>She found it easier to speak to Nicky; whom she shared a bowl of fries with, always giving him the biggest ones.</p><p>But she didn’t look at Agatha again.</p><p>Ralph continued to drink his whiskeys and Rio felt like she could smell his breath at this point, his bark of a laugh offensive to her ears, and the hand that now gesticulated arrogantly and had once held Agatha’s over the table, making her want to scream with every movement.</p><p>It was getting late and the wine was still flowing but Rio had given up drinking, deciding it wasn’t even numbing anymore.</p><p>And Nicky beside her was quieter again and soon leaning against her side, toying with his napkin in his lap.</p><p>“You know what makes me feel better when I’m tired?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“A chocolate milkshake. You know they make the best ones in the world here, right?”</p><p>Nicky looked up and Rio grinned and for a second she felt a little better about the whole situation.</p><p>Ralph hadn’t made Nicky grin like that. He’d barely looked at him all night.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said, and Rio knew instinctively she was talking to her so she looked up for the first time in over an hour.</p><p>“Maybe if you go to the bar they’ll make the special ones. I don’t think they bring the best ones to the table.”</p><p>If Rio were being dismissed, it didn’t feel like it. It felt instead like Agatha were asking her a favour, and she was more than willing to accept.</p><p>She nodded, caught the slight twitch in Agatha’s lips, and slid from the bench to take Nicky’s hand and pull him away with her to the bar.</p><p>As they stepped away she overheard Alice whisper, “Agatha, are you sure you didn’t steal that kid from Rio? Did she have a baby and not tell me?”</p><p>Rio hurried Nicky along, ignoring the eyes on her from all sides as they went past.</p><p>Fame came with a lot of pros but a big con was being on show all the time. And usually, it was manageable. But with a kid in tow, especially one that belonged to the woman she felt sick over, it felt dangerous.</p><p>As they arrived at the bar Rio manoeuvred them to a quieter section near the wall so Nicky would be sandwiched between her and the protection of the building itself.</p><p>It was cosy, calmer here than at the table, where tempers had been simmering since Ralph’s proclamation that Rio was trying to influence her son in some way.</p><p>Agatha had been a stoic presence, at some points torn between ripping Ralph’s head off and tempering him, and Rio had lost count of how many times she’d called him “honey”.</p><p>“Miss? I’m sorry, we can’t let children sit at the bar.”</p><p>But Rio was prepared for this. She put on her best movie star smile and placed her hand on the bar before her as Nicky stood by her side.</p><p>“I was hoping you’d make an exception. See, my friend here just got off a flight from the states and the only magical cure for tiredness at this time of night is the best chocolate milkshake in the world.”</p><p>The bar manager pressed his lips together and Rio knew he was fighting a smile. He leant forwards and peered down at Nicky.</p><p>Rio looked down at him too and saw that he looked shy and was hiding behind the hair now falling across his eyes.</p><p>Rio brushed it aside for him.</p><p>“Well… we <em>do</em> make the best milkshakes in the world, young man. One chocolate milkshake coming right up, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“Make that two please,” Rio smiled as she helped Nicky jump onto the bar stool.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Rio thanked the man with a gracious smile and settled on her own stool beside Nicky.</p><p>“Told you they were the best.”</p><p>Nicky smiled and began toying with the sleeves of his sweater and Rio turned over her shoulder to look at the little table they’d just left behind.</p><p>She caught Agatha’s eye where she was watching them closely and smiled before she turned back to Nicky and said: “You know, no one’s ever bought me a Celtics scarf before. I loved it so much.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Uh huh.”</p><p>“Mama said you would.”</p><p>Rio grinned and tilted her head as she began to fiddle with the napkin laid out before her. “She is a very smart woman.”</p><p>“Very smart,” Nicky agreed, straightening up to see what Rio was doing with the napkin.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio hummed quietly as she stuck her tongue between her teeth and tried to concentrate, ignoring the sharp pain of her thumb as she worked the light fabric. “Well, I learnt a little while ago how to make flowers so I’m just trying to remember.”</p><p>Nicky only nodded and watched for a while, until Rio produced what was, under no circumstances whatsoever, a flower.</p><p>“I think I forgot,” she held up her creation and pulled a face that made the little boy giggle and she found herself laughing with him just as the best milkshakes in the world arrived.</p><p>They both thanked the barman and Rio caught him winking at her in a way that didn’t feel predatory but made her feel like just perhaps they <em>were</em> about to have the best milkshakes in the world.</p><p>She turned to Nicky first and helped him with his straw so he could reach the drink without spilling it everywhere and then nudged her glass with his: “Cheers!”</p><p>“Cheers!” Nicky repeated before he proceeded to drink down half of his milkshake in one swift go.</p><p>“Woah, woah, calm down.”</p><p>Nicky grinned when he stopped and Rio rolled her eyes, pleased the best milkshake in the world was going down well.</p><p>They were silent for a while, Rio quietly counting how many years it had been since she’d actually <em>had</em> a chocolate milkshake, let alone the best one in the world, but Nicky interrupted her thoughts with a question of his own:</p><p>“Do we look the same?”</p><p>The question came from nowhere, and Rio almost choked on her own shake and grabbed her attempt at a napkin flower to cover her mouth quickly, just in case.</p><p>“Umm. Do you think we do?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio nodded thoughtfully, recovering somewhat, “Why do you ask?”</p><p>“A boy at school said his mom said we did.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, watching the thoughts swirl across a serious face. “Well I think we look a little similar, but not the same.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and pulled his shake closer towards him.</p><p>“Did you ask your mom about it?”</p><p>“She said I was very handsome and you are very beautiful and because of that we look a little the same.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Well I don’t mind looking a little like you. Do you mind looking a little like me?”</p><p>“No,” Nicky said, pulling the straw out from between his teeth.</p><p>Rio grinned and turned to take a sip of her own shake.</p><p>This really was the best milkshake in the world.</p><p>As she was placing her glass back down a hand found her lower back and she turned to find the person she’d hoped she would standing between the two stools.</p><p>“So? <em>Is</em> it the best milkshake in the world?”</p><p>“Yes, mama,” Nicky grinned and offered the straw up to Agatha who leant in to take some, humming thoughtfully as she did.</p><p>“Not bad. Not bad. And Rio? What does yours taste like?”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and bit down on her lip, pulling her milkshake away from Agatha’s now grabbing hand, “The same as Nicky’s.”</p><p>“A little the same,” Nicky said with a laugh.</p><p>“No, <em>exactly</em> the same,” Rio grinned as she pulled it further away from Agatha.</p><p>“You won’t let me try?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand was now just resting on her thigh where Rio had turned to the side and maybe it was the sugar, maybe it was just because they were alone again, maybe it was because Agatha was her soft self once more, but she felt happy for the first time all evening.</p><p>“Fine,” she said as she held out her glass and offered the straw up. “But don’t drink it all.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and leant in to try the shake and to Rio’s utter joy she squeezed her thigh as she did, confident Nicky would be too focused on his mom stealing her friend’s drink to notice.</p><p>“Delicious,” she announced as she pulled back with a grin, “Nicky was right, they are a little the same.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Rio said with a smirk as Agatha moved her hand back again.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and turned to her son again, brushing his hair back from his face gently. “You two okay over here? Having fun?”</p><p>“Yeah. Rio was trying to make a flower but it was very bad.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed dramatically, “It wasn’t <em>that</em> bad.”</p><p>“It was!” Nicky laughed out and Rio huffed again.</p><p>“Making flowers?” Rio looked up and caught Agatha’s eye and blushed a little, as she said: “a trick I learned a while back.”</p><p>“I remember.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a short breath then and caught Agatha’s gaze drop to her lips and she forgot all about Ralph, or about the fact that they were in public, and simply stared up at her, unwavering in her gaze until Nicky spoke up.</p><p>“Maybe you can try again with a green one. It’s lucky, you said so.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio smiled, turning back to Nicky and then busying herself with her straw as she finished her milkshake.</p><p>“I think blue ones are also nice.”</p><p>Rio choked on the last of her shake and Agatha slapped her back for her, eventually rubbing it in small circles as she came back to herself.</p><p>“That’s… yes… blue’s good,” she coughed out, embarrassed that she wasn’t just a woman choking at the bar, she was a movie star choking at the bar, which meant <em>everyone</em> was looking.</p><p>Months.</p><p>It was months ago that Rio had made Agatha that little blue flower.</p><p>Agatha who received flowers just for walking down the street, just for breathing, remembered the colour of the tiny, origami flower Rio had once made her.</p><p>It made her feel dizzy where she sat.</p><p>“We should go back,” Agatha said once Rio no longer looked like she was going to collapse.</p><p>Nicky turned away and began to finish off his shake faster than he’d begun it and Rio just turned to Agatha, caught her gaze, and saw again the sadness she’d seen briefly earlier and had spotted at the Globes.</p><p>“How is it over there?”</p><p>“A little the same.”</p><p>Rio smiled and rolled her eyes, poking at Agatha’s side gently.</p><p>“You’re staying at the Ritz?”</p><p>“Same floor as you.”</p><p>“How do you-…?”</p><p>But Nicky was slipping from his stool, standing with his hand in his mother’s and offering his other to Rio and Rio wouldn’t have refused it for the world.</p><p>They walked back, a happy trio, a trio that turned many heads and created many whispers, and Rio’s mood sank the closer and closer they go back to the table.</p><p>Ralph had his hand in the air and was clicking again.</p><p>Rio murdered him in her mind.</p><p>They slid in one by one into the booth and Nicky went to sit in Agatha’s lap, resting his head beneath her chin and smiling at Rio. Rio smiled back and she settled back into her seat a little closer to Agatha because of it.</p><p>“He’s too old for that,” came the voice of Ralph, who’d stopped clicking now he’d got the attention of one of the waiters.</p><p>“Ralph,” Agatha said simply, adjusting so her cheek was on the back of Nicky’s head.</p><p>“I’m telling you, you coddle him. He’ll grow up to be-…”</p><p>“What?” Agatha said sharply, her hold visibly tightening on Nicky. Rio moved a little closer.</p><p>“I for one,” Jen interjected, “Would <em>love</em> to be cuddled up in Agatha’s arms.” She made a very bad job of making a noise that would convince anyone she was telling the truth. “Mm, mm, mm. Ralph’s just jealous you’re not in his, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio looked over and saw that Agatha’s eyes were on Ralph but that Ralph was looking away now, preoccupied with the whisky being placed before him.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, ignoring the warning look shot her way by Alice. “Y’know who also gives really good hugs?”</p><p>“Who?” Nicky asked quietly, some of his previous light dimmed a little.</p><p>“Jen. She <em>loves</em> hugs. Especially those hugs where your hands are a little sticky from eating chocolate and you just smush yourself against her.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal, I am going to murder you.”</p><p>Rio made a face and wriggled her fingers in front of Nicky to make him laugh and Agatha pulled back to watch as Rio successfully got her son to giggle.</p><p>“You’re an idiot.”</p><p>“She’s a monster,” Jen added.</p><p>And Rio only grinned because Nicky was grinning again and Ralph was busy looking around for some girl to ogle.</p><p>And Agatha reached for her, squeezed her arm, and Rio turned back to her and saw something that made her understand what her mother meant when she said that pictures of Nuestra Señora y el Santo Niño filled her with great sorrow and great faith.</p><p>The picture before her was the perfect Pietà.</p><p>Agatha was cradling Nicky and looking at Rio with such an intense, open gaze, that Rio felt blessed just to see it. She yearned to reach for her, to brush the hair that had fallen into her face back, to cradle her cheek, to kiss her forehead and wrap her arms around them both.</p><p>“She’s silly,” Nicky said quietly, rubbing at his eyes as he did it and smiled.</p><p>“Sugar crash,” Agatha murmured against his hair, “that was quick.”</p><p>“I’m not long behind him.”</p><p>“No more room at the inn, I’m afraid,” Agatha said quietly, her brows raising a little as she motioned to the little boy in her arms with her head.</p><p>“Shame.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and turned around, hiding her smile in Nicky’s hair.</p><p>“Another bottle?” Jen asked with raised brows, picking the white wine she’d been sharing with Alice up and wriggling it.</p><p>“Not for me,” Agatha said and Rio shook her head too.</p><p>“I’ll take some.”</p><p>“I’ll share,” Ralph said, his attention back on the table now more alcohol was being offered.</p><p>“Oh good,” Jen deadpanned and Rio had to fight her smirk at her tone.</p><p>“You wanna get out of here?”</p><p>Rio was still struggling to hide her smirk and so didn’t look at Agatha and instead just nodded, reaching down to grab her purse.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said quickly and Rio looked up in surprise. “Seven is the latest you can sleep in. Okay? We have things to do.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but stood and went to kiss Alice’s cheek, “Yeah, yeah.”</p><p>She leant in on the other side to kiss Jen’s and found herself unable to pull up, Jen’s hand on the side of her head. In front of her Agatha was moving with a sleepy Nicky and she felt Alice turn curiously to them at her side.</p><p>“The photos. Rio. You can have them tomorrow. Just… focus your smiles a little more on Agatha rather than Wanda for me.”</p><p>Rio frowned in confusion and turned her head towards Jen, so close she could see the fine lines on her brow that she spent a lot of time and money getting rid of. She could see why Alice was obsessed with her.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said from beside the table, her hands on Nicky’s shoulders where they stood. “Ready?”</p><p>Rio continued to frown at Jennifer but she hadn’t answered her, was instead tapping her cheek, and smiling up at her. But she pulled away and watched Jen grin as she did so.</p><p>She made to move off but was distracted briefly by the sight of Ralph reaching to ruffle Nicky’s hair and then take hold of Agatha’s wrist.</p><p>Rio grit her teeth and turned from the sight of Agatha leaning towards him for fear she’d see something she’d never be able to unsee.</p><p>She got to the maitre d’ before Agatha and Nicky had and requested their jackets, her fingers tapping a random pattern as she tried to forget that whilst she was going home with Agatha, she wasn’t <em>going home</em> with Agatha.</p><p>Ralph would be.</p><p>Ralph who’d probably just kissed Agatha.</p><p>A hand curled around her elbow and Rio glanced to see Agatha there but didn’t look around properly. Neither of them said anything but Agatha held on until their jackets arrived and she had to let go to help Nicky into his then accept the help of the staff member now holding hers out.</p><p>Rio did the same and then made for the door. She stepped outside without thinking, walking into the dark, rainy night without checking.</p><p>The first flash was enough for her to realise her mistake.</p><p>The second was enough to make her turn.</p><p>The third was when her wide eyes fell to Agatha behind her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio spotted the maitre d’ stepping out around Agatha, barely large enough to form the barricade they needed. “Turn. Go.”</p><p>Rio froze as the flashes continued and Agatha took her hand as she stepped past with Nicky pressed in front of her and only then did Rio snapped back into her right mind and followed quickly behind Agatha, squeezing her hand firmly.</p><p>When they were in the car and the doors were closed Rio managed to get out: “Fuck. Fuck! I forgot I-…”</p><p>And then she turned and saw Nicky staring at her and Agatha frowning, busying herself with tugging Nicky’s jacket closer around him, “It’s fine.”</p><p>“It’s not. Ralph should have helped. He should have-… ,” but she stopped herself from the tirade she was on the precipice of, holding herself back for the sake of the little boy the other side of Agatha.</p><p>Rio huffed and ran her hands through her hair, “Sorry for the bad language, kid.”</p><p>Nicky only smiled sleepily and Agatha took her hand so she couldn’t play with her hair anymore and she held it in her lap, firmly, proudly, apparently not worried that Nicky could see it. And Nicky didn’t look concerned about it at all.</p><p>“They can be bad in London,” Agatha explained with that same frown, “There’ll be more at the hotel.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked around at Nicky before she moved her free hand to hold Agatha’s arm, “I’ll go first? Nicky can go behind me and-…”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed to brown and Rio wanted to lean in properly, to rest their foreheads together, to kiss away the concern.</p><p>“Stop being so-…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha just shook her head slightly, her frown returning as she looked away and Rio worried she were overstepping, caring too much about Nicky, about Agatha, but Agatha’s grip on her hand was still firm. She hadn’t stopped her thumb from brushing over the back of Rio’s hand, and she hadn’t moved her arm away where Rio still held it.</p><p>They rode mostly in silence and when they pulled up to the entrance Rio could squint through the dark windows to see the looming, ominous figures of men waiting with large cameras.</p><p>Agatha released her hand after squeezing it and helped Nicky climb over her to wait beside Rio until they were ready to clamber out.</p><p>Someone opened the door for them and Rio slid quickly out, turning only to help Nicky and take his hand and forming a barrier between him and the flashing cameras until she felt Agatha step out behind them. As a trio they made their way into the hotel - Nicky sandwiched between them and this time more staff members helping, including one beast of a security guard who walloped a man trying to get in Rio’s face.</p><p>By the time they were in the calm of the hotel lobby, Rio’s heart rate felt less than steady. She turned to check on her charges and saw Agatha bending down to tug Nicky’s jacket into place where it had slipped in the rush and saw the damp hair that stuck to her face.</p><p>She looked wild and protective and then she was looking up at her and she looked exactly the same. Cautious baby blues scanned her over, detecting any harm, and in seeing none, she moved to adjust Rio’s collar and said in a low voice, “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and watched as Agatha’s gaze dropped to it and for a brief moment in time she thought she might kiss her. But instead she pulled away, leading Nicky to the elevator and Rio followed behind.</p><p>Inside the small space, Rio reached for Agatha’s hand again, out of sight from Nicky the other side of her. She interlinked their fingers and Agatha leant against her arm for the duration of the short ride to their floor.</p><p>Agatha let Nicky step out first and took advantage of their brief privacy to turn and kiss Rio’s cheek, pressing her nose against her warm skin briefly before she pulled away and followed her son out along the hallway.</p><p>And Rio followed behind, her eyes on Agatha as she sauntered down the hall, her back straight, her hands casually at her sides, her wild hair bouncing in waves across her back to the rhythm of each step.</p><p>It felt surreal sometimes, seeing Agatha like this. Like being a total outsider in her life. Someone who didn’t know how she sounded when she came, someone who couldn’t tell you the specific shade of blue her eyes were when she woke, someone who didn’t get access to her softness.</p><p>She was just another woman with her sleepy son in a hotel in London. Just another movie star.</p><p>And Rio was just another victim of falling for the wrong person.</p><p>Agatha’s suite was first and Rio stopped to kiss Nicky on the top of the head, smiling as he cuddled in briefly before she turned to Agatha. She kissed her, briefly, sweetly, on the cheek and then turned before she could begin to pine once more.</p><p>The solitude of her own room didn’t help much. By the time she’d shrugged off her jacket and changed into soft flannel pyjamas, she was thinking about the woman a few doors down. How she’d be tucking Nicky in, changing into her own pyjamas, and waiting for her husband to return.</p><p>Rio settled on the little bench by the window and similar to any myriad of movie scenes since the dawn of time, she rested her head against the pane, thought of her lover, and watched the rain pour.</p><p>There was a soft knock at her door just as Rio was beginning to wonder if anyone in the world had ever been this down bad before and she turned to see if she’d imagined it. When it happened again she knew she hadn’t.</p><p>She moved slowly to open it and blinked furiously into the light of the hotel corridor where Agatha stood, still in her clothes, minus her jacket, smiling hopefully across at her.</p><p>“I don’t have long.”</p><p>Rio stepped aside to let Agatha in and closed the door quietly behind her.</p><p>“Nicky’s asleep but he’s alone. I can’t be long.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said softly, now standing with her hand on the door handle in the dim light of the unlit room.</p><p>“I don’t have long,” Agatha said again and Rio wondered who she was trying to remind of this fact. Rio bit her lip and cautiously reached up towards Agatha and found her waist was grabbed before she could even make contact.</p><p>Two gasps filled the air when their bodies pressed tightly together for the first time in weeks and Rio frowned where she saw hesitance in Agatha’s eyes so she turned them and pressed Agatha up against the door, frowning as she leant closer to kiss some certainty into her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips were warm against her own and the hands that slipped below her flannel were cool against her skin. Agatha tasted like rich red wine and Rio couldn’t drink enough of her in; could never have enough of the taste of her.</p><p>It was Agatha who deepened the kiss, and Agatha who nipped at Rio’s lower lip when they broke apart for air, and Agatha who dug her nails into the tender flesh of Rio’s hips as she moaned into her mouth.</p><p>But it was Rio who pulled back, ducked down, began kissing along Agatha’s jaw, across her throat, desperate to taste more of her.</p><p>“I don’t have long,” Agatha murmured as Rio tugged her sweater down to kiss over her collarbone, grunting as she moved to kiss the heavy wool over her breasts, trailing down until she hit her stomach and could lift it again to access Agatha’s pale skin.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered desperately, Rio’s left hand curled around Agatha’s thigh to anchor her as she continued to kiss and lick the sensitive skin of her stomach.</p><p>Rio looked up and caught Agatha’s gaze, saw the need in her eyes and could no longer stand not having her mouth on her any longer.</p><p>Her movements had been precise and as slow as she could make them before but now she scrambled to undo Agatha’s jeans. She fumbled with the zipper, and Agatha made an impatient noise above her that made Rio huff.</p><p>“I don’t have-…”</p><p>But Rio ripped the button open and the zipper came loose then and Agatha’s words died on her tongue as Rio tore the denim from her hips and replaced it with her hands.</p><p>As if the gods were laughing at her, Rio found that all night Agatha had apparently been wearing the tiniest lacy black panties. And she stared at the vision before her; her fingers now curled around the delicate fabric over Agatha’s thighs, the black of the fabric a delicious contrast with the milkiness of the skin it sat on.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whined quietly, “baby.”</p><p>“Can I… can I have a picture of you in these?”</p><p>She looked up, blinked at the woman above her, unashamed and unfaltering in her request, needing to have the sight before her memorialised forever, perhaps she’d blow it up and have it above her bed.</p><p>Agatha was breathing heavily, her top teeth buried in the softness of her pouting lower lip, and she brought her hands over to run through Rio’s dark hair, scratching briefly at her scalp.</p><p>“Yes. If you hurry.”</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning close to sink her teeth into the delicate lace, conscious if she ripped them her picture would be ruined - and only briefly wondering if it might make it better.</p><p>But she pulled them down quickly, hurrying against whatever internal timer Agatha was working against and her own desire to taste Agatha again.</p><p>Once the lace was down at pale ankles, the new sight before her was even better.</p><p>Agatha was wet already, she didn’t need to touch her to know that. And her hips stirring a little before her made Rio smile as she leant in, and when her tongue made first contact with Agatha’s pussy she moaned against it, feeling nails dig into her scalp and the thighs she clung to flex beneath her hold.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed out above her, and Rio had barely done anything. Had only tasted, had only started.</p><p>But she was starved suddenly, ravenous for Agatha, and drunk on the taste of her, on the mess she was making of her thighs and Rio’s face.</p><p>Rio could barely move, so tight was the grip on her hair, so desperate were Agatha’s insistent movements of her hips.</p><p>But Rio would have stayed there all night, frozen in place and straining to give Agatha what she wanted if that’s what it took. She let her ride her tongue, let her rub her clit against the hard cartilage of her nose, let her fuck her face until she came with a barely contained cry.</p><p>It didn’t take long.</p><p>Her movements slowed and her hold loosened enough that Rio took the opportunity to clean her canvas, lapping at her greedily to take as much as she could before she winced as Agatha forcibly pulled her head back, her fingers still buried deep in her hair.</p><p>Staring up at her dumbly she caught something predatory, something furious in Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>It made her whine a little, unable to speak, instead just pressing her thighs tightly together to try for some relief.</p><p>She knew she must look pathetic to her. In her plaid pyjamas, her eyes wide and her mouth equally so, her lips swollen and her face covered in Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha was looking away, she was leaning around Rio, and crucially, she hadn’t softened.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio uttered as Agatha leant down and pulled her underwear and jeans back up.</p><p>“Hey, just stay. Just give me five more minutes.”</p><p>But Agatha was moving around her, ignoring Rio as she remained kneeling before her. The older woman stumbled a little as she stepped aside and buttoned her jeans back up.</p><p>There was a second of no movement at all and then she’d stepped around her fully, opened the door as much as she could with it now knocking Rio’s knees, and had stepped outside.</p><p>The door closed with a soft <em>click</em> and Rio was alone again. Naturally.</p><p>The change in her demeanour was so sudden, so unexpected, that Rio could barely register the pain of it.</p><p>She wiped Agatha from her lips and stared at the door now shutting her off from the woman she’d just been worshipping.</p><p>The shadows beneath the door told her that Agatha still stood there, that she was just on the other side, and she stared at them until she could no longer stand it and she breathed her name like a prayer: “Agatha?”</p><p>There was silence, no movement, but Rio knew it was her. She could feel her through the wood.</p><p>And then, slowly, the shadows moved and there was a soft knocking on the door.</p><p>Rio leant up to open it but didn’t move from where she knelt, just pulled the door back until it hit her knees and watched as Agatha slipped back inside.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look surprised at Rio’s position, stock-still, waiting. She merely stood before her again, her left hand moving just the few inches forwards to curl beneath Rio’s chin.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>In the dim, Agatha looked softer than Rio had ever seen her before. It was like a magic trick. She’d disappeared for ten seconds and come back a different woman. She looked almost as if she weren’t there at all. But Rio’s hands now rested on her calves and she felt the soft brush of Agatha’s thumb along her jaw which told her all she needed to know about Agatha being here, being real, being soft again.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Rio could only frown, only clutch at Agatha’s jeans, only lean into her touch.</p><p>“Tell you what?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a slow breath and before she spoke again Rio realised what she was about to say: “Tell me what you tried to tell me in Boston. If you still feel it… tell me.”</p><p>Rio had grown up on fairytales. She’d consumed them with a ferocity that neither of her parents could keep up with. First in Spanish, then she’d wanted them all over again in English. She devoured the stories they told her like she had been starved of words all her life.</p><p>As she got older she’d moved onto books of her own, movies that deemed themselves “romantic comedies”, stories of love lost and love found.</p><p>Later, she sought it out in bars and on apps, in work, and even on beaches.</p><p>She found love in every form she could get it, and it never satisfied her.</p><p>It never felt real or wonderful or <em>enough</em>.</p><p>Until the day she’d looked across at Agatha Harkness at the side of a basketball court and she’d realised she’d found what she’d always been looking for.</p><p>And now Agatha was <em>asking</em> for it. Asking her to confirm it in words when she’d been trying to confirm it in her actions before she could even put a word to it.</p><p>So she breathed the words she’d said disingenuously to women before, the ones she hadn’t meant until now:</p><p>“I love you. I’m in love with you.”</p><p>And Agatha sucked in the words she’d breathed out, as if they’d been a surprise, as if she had expected Rio to refuse or to say something else.</p><p>And then her soft eyes closed and Rio had no choice but to lean into her, to kneel up and move her hands up to the soft fabric of her sweater in an attempt to pull her down towards her. But Agatha didn’t move, she kept her eyes closed and Rio waited patiently for them to open again, hoping she might say it back.</p><p>Rio whispered her name but Agatha only gasped out the words she’d inhaled, breathed the feel of them back into the room, but saying nothing.</p><p>More exquisite than any pain she’d ever experienced, the pain of Agatha being silent when she’d told her how she felt was excruciating.</p><p>In the quiet, in the dark, in the space of just the two of them, she hadn’t said it back.</p><p>But her hand was still curled around Rio’s chin, her other hand moving to rest on Rio’s arm, Rio knew she felt it, she had to believe she felt it, or she’d crumble beneath her. She’d die like the tragic heroes of the tales she used to read; only there was nothing heroic about her anymore, only tragedy was left.</p><p>“I need to get back,” Agatha murmured eventually, pulling her hands away and slowly opening her eyes.</p><p>Agatha looked defeated rather than comforted and Rio shifted beneath her, “Just stay a little longer.”</p><p>“Nicky’s alone. I need to get back to him.”</p><p>Rio nodded, not because she wanted to, but because she knew it was the right thing to do.</p><p>“It hurts,” she said as Agatha made a move to go, “it hurts to see you with Ralph. To not be able to-… it hurts.”</p><p>Agatha’s pale hand was on the door handle beside her, and she stopped where she stood to turn and look down at Rio still kneeling before her.</p><p>Rio’s hands moved down again, moving to the backs of Agatha’s thighs to pull her closer, and the woman above her allowed this, allowed Rio to pull her until she was sitting back and pulling Agatha into her lap, holding her in place as Agatha’s hands found their home in Rio’s hair again, softer and more tender than they had been before.</p><p>Rio found she couldn’t speak, the vulnerability of her declaration suddenly choking her. But Agatha didn’t let her suffer any more than she already had.</p><p>She leant in and kissed Rio, kissing her so delicately that Rio’s lips barely reacted before she pulled away. “I have to go, Rio.”</p><p>And Rio nodded again, and found strength in Agatha wrapping her legs around her waist, in Agatha’s soft eyes moving over her face, in her thumbs as they rubbed gently against her temple.</p><p>It felt like she were being treasured, like she was being cherished, and then she caught the tear that had fallen from Agatha’s eye and she raised her hand to wipe it just as Agatha pulled back and stood, stumbling a little back into the door.</p><p>“I need to go.”</p><p>And she was gone before Rio could protest.</p>

<p>“He’s an ass,” were the words that woke Rio from her sleep. She shifted and groaned and huffed but found she couldn’t move away because above the covers Alice was lying beside her with her arm thrown around her middle.</p><p>“I can’t believe… he’s just such a…”</p><p>“Cunt?” Rio offered groggily, assuming she already knew who Alice was taking about.</p><p>“Yeah. A cunt.”</p><p>Rio huffed an attempt at a laugh but it died somewhere along her mid-nasal passage.</p><p>“And that kid, Rio. I didn’t mean to stare but… it’s weird.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“No, like, it’s <em>weird</em>. It’s like someone has taken <em>you</em>, maybe sprinkled a bit of Agatha in there and-…”</p><p>“Yes, Alice.”</p><p>Alice sighed and rolled onto her back to let Rio struggle out from the cocoon she’d made for herself in the bed.</p><p>“Is it hard?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Loving a woman and loving her son too?”</p><p>Rio froze where she sat at the edge of the bed and turned her head slightly, waiting for Alice to say “gotcha!” or change the subject immediately. But she didn’t.</p><p>“I don’t love Nicky.”</p><p>“Rio, it’s unbelievable that you think it’s not totally obvious.”</p><p>“You didn’t pick up on my feelings for Agatha. You’re just seeing things now.”</p><p>Rio moved over to the en suite to grab her toothbrush.</p><p>“I’m seeing that you want them. The family. You want <em>this</em> family.”</p><p>It was too early to feel this fragile, to feel the keen sting of every word said to her that contained even the vaguest memory of the night before.</p><p>“It’s not mine to have.”</p><p>Alice sighed quietly where she now stood watching Rio brushing her teeth and avoiding looking at her own reflection in the mirror.</p><p>“Wanda’s here now. She got in early this morning. Let’s grab lunch with her.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything and eventually Alice left her to it, trusting that she’d get on with getting ready for the day without her constantly by her side.</p><p>And Rio did. She showered and changed and put on a little makeup just to hide the bags under her eyes.</p><p>She’d scrubbed her face so as to remove the memory of Agatha all over it. She’d washed her hair to wash away the feel of Agatha’s fingers tangled in it.</p><p>But nothing worked to rid herself of the weight that had settled deep within her chest.</p><p>By the time she was ready she was decidedly <em>not</em> excited about the BAFTAs that night. Because Ralph would be there, and Agatha would be with him.</p><p>She left the room to go and fetch Alice at precisely 8:15am and soon they were on their way to the first stop of the day: getting Rio’s nails done.</p><p>Leaving the hotel wasn’t as stressful as arriving the night before. Perhaps in the UK paps didn’t start until 9am and worked until the early hours of the morning before rotating again. Or perhaps, no one cared as much about Rio Vidal as they did about Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Still, London was waiting, and whether to cheer Rio up or simply because Alice loved London almost as much as she loved organising Rio’s life, the two went off - via the tube, much to Rio’s secret delight - to Borough Market, where, after getting her nails done, they spent the morning shopping the stalls and Rio spent much of it looking for a replacement to her favourite shirt.</p><p>It would have been a good distraction from her torment if it had worked.</p><p>She found that fans were a little more polite here, or at least quieter than they were in the states. She was bothered a little less but stared at more and soon decided on buying a beanie hat to try to be more incognito.</p><p>This did not work either.</p><p>But with a new shirt that Alice absolutely hated - it had the words ‘lick my’ and then ice cream cones printed all over it - and several garish souvenirs she thought her mom would like, they made their way back to the hotel in time to meet Wanda for a quick bite at the restaurant.</p><p>Rio settled herself in one of the little red dining chairs and found herself alone at the table with Wanda, Alice having excused herself before they’d even been shown the table.</p><p>“You’ve worked your magic on my manager.”</p><p>“Nonsense! I’ve just… asked her to leave us alone for an hour or so.”</p><p>“Which is strange because usually you love her company.”</p><p>“I like yours more.”</p><p>The flirt was clear and Rio might have gone along with it a little while ago, or perhaps even if she weren’t on the edge of a breakdown, but this time it felt like it meant too much, could mean everything.</p><p>“I’m not doing what you want me to,” she said quietly as a waiter hovered nearby ready to take drinks orders.</p><p>“And I won’t force you. I just-…” She was interrupted by the very waiter who’d been hovering. They made their order and he left. “I just think it would help us both. Admittedly me a little more than you.”</p><p>Rio began spinning her hair around her finger, “What’re you wearing tonight?”</p><p>Changing the subject was easier than fighting it.</p><p>“Louis. Some sleek, black, sparkly thing. Will we match?”</p><p>Rio settled back in her seat as the waiter came to pour the wine. “I’m in red and black so, we’ll be fine. Actually, Versace want to exclusively dress me for the rest of the season. Alice thinks they might make me their spokesperson.”</p><p>“Oh, c’mon, Rio. Give me a little piece of the pie. Please make sure we stay together at the after party? Even with Agatha there it’ll be…”</p><p>“Are you making my big win with a huge fashion house about you?” Rio grinned behind her wine glass, relaxing a little with how ludicrous this whole situation was.</p><p>“I’m <em>trying</em> to make it a little about me.”</p><p>Rio laughed and placed her glass down again, leaning over the table towards Wanda. “Why won’t you take no for an answer?”</p><p>“Because you’re holding out on me and I want to know why.”</p><p>Rio laughed again but made the mistake of turning her attention to the restaurant entrance as she reached back out for her wine. Across the heads of the various diners, Rio saw the one person she’d not expected to see until later. The one person she could still taste on her tongue. Agatha was standing beside her son at the entrance to the restaurant.</p><p>The fingers outstretched to take up her wine glass missed and red wine went pouring onto the white table cloth and into Wanda’s lap.</p><p>“Fuck. Shit.”</p><p>In the middle of the Ritz restaurant, Rio performed in the most mortifying scene of her career.</p><p>She stood as two waiters arrived to help, and Wanda laughed as Rio panicked and her cheeks flamed as red as the Shiraz now bleeding out on the table.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio huffed as she uselessly patted at Wanda’s shirt with a cloth napkin, scowling at the mess she’d made across it.</p><p>“It’s only Zara,” Wanda whispered and placed her hand over Rio’s busy one to stop her. “Hey. It’s okay.”</p><p>“Ladies, allow us to remove you somewhere a little… drier,” came the patronising voice of the head waiter now looking at Rio like she were trash, or worse, American.</p><p>“Actually,” Wanda started just as Rio felt a hand on her lower back and the only thing that could have possibly made this worse arrived on the scene.</p><p>“Too much wine already?” Agatha was smiling and raising her brows at her, the pads of her fingers pressing into her back and her eyes glinting in the midday sun streaming through the tall windows.</p><p>The light caught Agatha’s face just as she turned slightly and Rio saw the telltale signs of a sleepless night. The weight that had settled in her chest since the night before now dropped further into her stomach and she felt nauseous all of a sudden.</p><p>“Just clumsy,” Rio said quietly, her cheeks still aflame.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid away and Rio caught her gaze dart to her red cheeks before settling again on the state of Wanda Maximoff covered in a £30 glass of Shiraz.</p><p>“Red suits you,” she said with such amusement in her voice that it almost made Rio smile. Almost.</p><p>She felt movement by her side that distracted her from Wanda’s reaction and looked down to see Nicky now standing before his mom, watching Wanda with a shy gaze.</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda laughed breezily, “Not the worst thing that’s been thrown on me. You must be Nicky?”</p><p>She bent down to grin at the boy and Agatha’s hand moved swiftly to his shoulder.</p><p>Nicky held out his hand to her and Rio bit her lip, taking it upon herself to introduce the two when Agatha remained silent. “Nicky, this is Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda shook his hand with an easy smile and then straightened up, “God, the internet was <em>so</em> right. It’s almost eerie. Has he ever thought of acting?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond - Rio assumed in the negative, it would just be the degree of venom that would differ - but the waiter had placed himself closer again.</p><p>“Ladies? Will I make up a table for four?”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda said, “no, thank you. Rio and I will take ours up to my room. Thanks so much.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio and Rio saw the panic in her eyes before she had a chance to cool it and Rio couldn’t do anything but step forward and press her lips to Agatha’s cheek, muttering a quiet, “Just friends,” before she pulled back and ducked down to Nicky.</p><p>She gave him a quick squeeze and then watched as Wanda moved to place a kiss to Agatha’s other cheek and she caught the pursing of Agatha’s lips, the way she couldn’t even fake a smile.</p><p>But Wanda was leading her away, unabashed by the large red stain across her crisp white button down. And Rio followed, turning only when they were at the end of the long room to see Agatha taking a seat at a nearby table with Nicky, her attention on him, her eyes that soft way again.</p><p>“It’s Agatha, isn’t it,” Wanda said cautiously as they settled into the elevator to go up to her floor.</p><p>“You’ve got a crush.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “On a married woman? How would not dating you help me with that?”</p><p>Wanda was silent for a while and Rio watched her as she bought into Rio’s lie, “The kid looks like you.”</p><p>“I’ve heard.”</p><p>She broke into a smile and Wanda glanced at her only to catch it too, laughing at the absurdity of it, “He’s cute.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Oh shut up.”</p><p>Rio laughed properly then, tugging at the still-damp and ruined shirt Wanda wore and Wanda slapped her away. Some of the tension broke in that little elevator and Wanda didn’t ask again about the proposed PR relationship.</p><p>Instead, they ate salads (they had to be red carpet ready), drank wine (Rio opted for white this time to save the soft furnishings in Wanda’s suite), and lounged around until Alice and Wanda’s manager came to find them to whisk them away for the prep ahead of them.</p><p>It was easy. But it wasn’t Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s prep didn’t take as long as it usually might because she’d opted for a block colour tux, red to her waist, and black along the bottom of the blazer, matching the pants which had a red stripe down the outer side of each leg.</p><p>It meant the focus of the afternoon’s work was on her face, and the part of her chest that would be exposed, rather than her whole body.</p><p>Which also meant there were fewer bodies surrounding her as she sipped an iced coffee through a straw and Alice read off the names of people she needed to thank if she won.</p><p>“I really don’t think-,” but she was cut off but a light kick to her shin. It was a good thing she was wearing pants. Alice had left some bruises from the previous night’s dinner.</p><p>“Just listen,” Alice insisted, “it’s good to thank the right people.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and went back to staring at herself in the mirror wondering what Agatha would show up in tonight.</p><p>She thought of the way she’d held her face last night, searching for something Rio couldn’t figure out.</p><p>She thought of the strange mixture of hard and soft that made up Agatha’s personality. She thought of why she was so frightened all the time. And the heaviness that had settled hours ago started to churn in her hungry, salad-filled stomach.</p><p>“Get those?”</p><p>Rio’s brow twitched as Alice nudged her again.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“How can you learn so many lines but not remember names.”</p><p>“I remember names.”</p><p>“Who did I just say last?”</p><p>Rio frowned a little and bit on her cheek, “Yourself?”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>The makeup artist trying to perfect Rio’s eyeliner laughed and Rio grinned up at her, pleased someone was on her side at least.</p><p>“Did you coordinate your look tonight?”</p><p>“With who?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>In the mirror Rio caught Alice leaning closer.</p><p>“No? Why?”</p><p>“Well, there’s pictures of you everywhere and you’re the favourites to win and I just thought…”</p><p>Rio blinked up at the makeup artist and then looked up the ceiling when she moved to do her waterline. “Is Agatha in black?”</p><p>“Red.”</p><p>“How do-…?”</p><p>“We all know each other. We all talk. You’d be surprised what we know.”</p><p>A delicate hand pulled away to inspect her handiwork and Rio blinked up at her, fighting off the tears that always threatened to come whenever someone was anywhere near her eyes.</p><p>“Hear anything good from Agatha’s camp?”</p><p>It was like discovering gold at the end of the rainbow, this perfect, untapped source of knowledge, of information. She couldn’t help the question as she tilted her head back again to allow for her second eye to be painted.</p><p>“The usual. It’s always a little more tense over there when the husband’s around.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio asked, feigning casual when she was suddenly rabid.</p><p>“Mmhm,” the artist hummed, “cute kid though.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to ask more questions but closed it again, wondering if she were being given as much as she could get already and she’d look too unprofessional if she asked more.</p><p>But she was saved the indignity of begging for details: “I know you’re friends with Agatha so I don’t want to say anything out of turn but… she can be frosty.”</p><p>Rio fought a smile but decided to remain silent.</p><p>“Not <em>rude</em>, apparently. Just… not friendly.”</p><p>Alice beside her looked up from her phone and said: “With a husband like that I think I’d be frosty too.”</p><p>Rio scoffed quietly and the makeup artist pulled away to admire her work with a smile, “Oh, she’s not the worst I’ve heard of. But I hear it’s been getting worse lately.”</p><p>This made Rio speak. “Oh? How so?”</p><p>She caught Alice looking at her through the mirror, caught the way her gaze dropped to Rio’s hands that now clutched at her sleeves, felt the way she continued to eye her as she got her answer: “Hard to say. A little more tense, maybe. I’ve only heard she’s been a bit snappier, is all.”</p><p>But to Rio, Agatha appeared sadder, softer, so if she were snappier that was news to her. Must be because she… but Alice was speaking and Rio lost her train of thought.</p><p>“Ralph told us last night they were in a really good place.”</p><p>Rio started to feel hot, too hot.</p><p>“He said they had a good Christmas and-…”</p><p>“That’s not true.”</p><p>Alice and the makeup artist both paused and looked around at Rio, one in slight shock, the other with a knowing glint in her eye.</p><p>“It’s just,” Rio trailed off, realising her bravado had overtaken her logical mind. “It’s just not true.”</p><p>“Okay, babe,” Alice said softly, reaching over to hold Rio’s hand and squeezing it but changing the subject immediately.</p><p>And Alice spoke so much for the rest of the day that Rio barely had time to dwell on Agatha’s apparent dip in moods or the fact that she was across the corridor with her husband or that Ralph was telling everyone who would listen how happy they were.</p><p>She thought she might see Agatha before they left for the Southbank Centre where the ceremony was to take place. But she saw nothing.</p><p>Though, apparently, this wasn’t the case for everyone. Because the lobby was full by the time Rio entered it with Alice. Everyone looked their way and Rio felt strangely judged by everyone suddenly, strangely inspected, strangely…</p><p>“Holy shit,” Alice said quietly, her grip on the back of Rio’s blazer as she carried two purses and her own phone.</p><p>Rio just pushed through, ignoring the stares as best she could. Until, finally, mercifully, she was stepping into their waiting car and the door was closed on the mayhem.</p><p>“That felt…”</p><p>“Yeah. Think everyone was expecting Wanda.”</p><p>“Oh, thanks.”</p><p>“No,” Alice huffed quietly, “<em>You</em> and Wanda.”</p><p>Rio’s head almost snapped off its axis as she turned to Alice. “What?”</p><p>Sighing like this was the fiftieth time Rio had asked today, Alice responded: “Some ‘source’ claimed you’d told some wannabe model you were seeing someone. The internet has decided that’s Wanda.”</p><p>“Fuck my life.”</p><p>“Yep. Well I’m pretty pleased.”</p><p>Rio turned to look out the window, and wondered why it wasn’t easy. Why everything made all of this harder and harder and the only time she ever felt sane and calm was when she was alone with Agatha.</p><p>The traffic made the journey to the red carpet last a lifetime and by the time Rio was in the centre of it all again, being followed up the carpet with a man and his large umbrella, she felt more tense than she usually did at these things - which was saying something.</p><p>But the rain helped.</p><p>It meant there was less time spent alone on the carpet, and more time huddled under large umbrellas, making small talk with vaguely familiar faces.</p><p>“Rio,” a hand found her lower back and a warmth by her shoulder told her that Agatha must be nearby, but this was not her, this was Ralph.</p><p>“Ralph,” she said with no hint at warmth as she turned just in time to receive a kiss to her cheek from the man who was still holding her back.</p><p>“You missed a fun night.”</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>“Prefer to go home with my wife and young son? A sin, you know.”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“Coveting thy neighbour’s wife.”</p><p>Smarmy, sanctimonious shit.</p><p>Rio bit down so hard on her tongue she was surprised when she didn’t taste pennies.</p><p>“You look lovely, by the way.” His eyes darted briefly to the expanse of skin visible beneath Rio’s blazer, “Maybe you’ll find someone else to-…”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t realised that her hands were fists at her sides, that she was squeezing so hard she was hurting her bruised thumb, leaving indents of her nails in her palms. But a soft touch to her injured hand brought her back from the brink and Rio didn’t have to look to know who it was.</p><p>“Necesito hablar contigo.” <em>I need to talk to you.</em></p><p>The whisper was soft, and took Rio by surprise, and she turned into Agatha, saw her blue gaze and red lips and she nodded, unfurling her fist to hold Agatha’s hand instead. “Okay. Let’s go-…”</p><p>“Later,” Agatha promised just as quietly, a small frown gracing her features as her gaze dropped to look Rio over. “You look good.”</p><p>“You look,” Rio breathed in slowly, her eyes trying and failing to take all of Agatha in as her brain equally failed to describe what she saw. Agatha’s makeup blocked her favourite freckles from view, but her red lips matched her red dress and the sight of it against Agatha’s pale skin was enough to make Rio fall to her knees all over again.</p><p>The bodice of the dress was tight to her torso and Rio’s free hand moved up to wrap around her upper ribs, unable to stop herself from reaching for the woman who’d left her alone in the dark the night before.</p><p>“You look-…”</p><p>She raised her gaze again, and saw a pain reflected back at her in blue eyes that made the weight in her stomach triple and her body react before she could think. She’d pulled Agatha back into her, wrapping the arm that held her waist tightly around her and squeezed their entwined fingers down at their sides.</p><p>Agatha had gasped into the hold and Rio felt her turn her head slightly when Rio whispered: “Esperé toda la noche a que volvieras.” <em>I waited all night for you to come back.</em></p><p>Agatha pulled away, breaking Rio’s tight hold on her and grinned at Rio in a way that the receiver knew to be false because the giver’s eyes were swimming with unshed tears.</p><p>It was for the cameras, the people around them, for Ralph, but Rio couldn’t bring herself to lie anymore. And so she frowned at Agatha, saw the fault lines appear in the structured smile, and Agatha’s fingers squeeze her own so tightly she thought she’d have another bruise soon.</p><p>“Luego. Hablamos luego.” <em>Later. Let’s talk later.</em></p><p>“Darling,” Ralph’s voice cut across them and Rio ignored it and Agatha did too, keeping her teary gaze on Rio as she watched her process the request. “Is that Spanish? Bon voyage, let’s go grab a drink before it starts.”</p><p>Rio barely reacted to his words, saw that Agatha hadn’t either, and she instead leant in to cup Agatha’s cheek and press a soft kiss before her ear, allowing herself to just brush her nose on the soft skin there before she pulled away and turned totally to Ralph.</p><p>“I’ll see you in there.”</p><p>Ralph only grinned and held his hand out to his wife who took it behind Rio and stepped around her. The soft squeeze of her hip hold her that Agatha had gone with her husband and Rio looked the other way so she didn’t have to see her again.</p><p>And Rio was alone again, only this time in a sea of people.</p><p>But not for long. No one is ever truly alone on a red carpet, shoulder to shoulder with other industry heavyweights, every move photographed, every turn noted down.</p><p>Buoyed along by the tide, Rio eventually made it to safer shores and entered the auditorium with Alice back by her side.</p><p>“Remember, Jen’s given us the go ahead but I’d really encourage you to stick with Wanda. Wanda <em>and</em> Agatha, if you have to. But <em>Wanda</em>. It’s good for the movie and it’s good for <em>you</em>. Those photos were golden and maybe lightning does strike twice.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but roll her eyes just as an attendant came to show them to their seats.</p><p>But Alice was still talking: “She’s hot and sweet and you already like her so I can’t see-…”</p><p> “Alice,” Rio whispered back, “please. Not now.” Alice didn’t say anything else as they moved towards their seats.</p><p>They were on the front row, and Rio had the pleasure of being beside Ralph, who sat beside Agatha on her right, Jen unfortunately having chosen her left side, meaning Rio was left with the husband.</p><p>She smiled at Jen, shot Agatha the same, and ignored Ralph.</p><p>“Lucky me,” he said with all the charm of a tapeworm as Rio took her seat and crossed her legs over neatly.</p><p>“Clearly I’m the lucky one,” Rio drawled, unable to look his way and instead choosing to turn around to see if anyone else was nearby that she could focus her attentions on whilst the audience settled in.</p><p>But she felt a hand on her knee and she was just about to slap it away - assuming Ralph - when she turned to see Agatha leaning across her husband and smiling up at her, “Try not to look too disappointed when I win.”</p><p>Rio’s chest swelled with warmth at the look on Agatha’s face, none of the softness from before was gone but she looked a little more hopeful, the warm hand that held her knee still, the teasing tone of her voice, she was back to her usual self, “Only if you promise not to gloat later on.”</p><p>“I’ll buy you a drink to make up for it.”</p><p>“It’s a free bar, superstar.”</p><p>“A poet now?”</p><p>Rio laughed and for a fleeting, happy moment, forgot that Agatha was only leaning this way because her husband was between them. Only Ralph wanted to make his presence known and he reached for Agatha’s hand and stole it away as a photographer came by to capture the three of them: two lovers, and the husband.</p><p>Rio smiled for the camera and then turned to catch Agatha’s eye and saw her smile had faded as quickly as her own had and she looked apologetic, almost guilty.</p><p>But Ralph was still holding her hand, and had wrapped his free arm around Agatha’s shoulders as if to keep her from leaning back in, but Rio wouldn’t give up without a fight. Not anymore.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha, a wager.”</p><p>A quirked brow and a twitch of Agatha’s lips was all the encouragement she needed.</p><p>“If you win, you can post on my insta. Any of my socials. Whatever you want,” Agatha’s grin grew and she tilted her head, leaning a little out of Ralph’s hold. “But if <em>I</em> win, then I get a dance. And photographic evidence of it.”</p><p>Ralph cleared his throat quietly but Agatha ignored it, and lifted her hand out from underneath her husband’s to hold it out to Rio, “You got yourself a deal, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio smirked shamelessly, squeezing Agatha’s hand as she shook it. “I look forward to our dance.”</p><p>“Yeah yeah,” Agatha laughed as she pulled away and settled back in her seat. Suddenly Ralph’s arm around Agatha mattered a little less, and Rio bit the inside of her cheek to hold back her grin as she leant back in her seat.</p><p>“Flirting,” Alice murmured from the corner of her mouth, watching Rio with a warning look in her eye. “Save some of that for Wanda.”</p><p>Rio only hummed and took advantage of Ralph stubbornly keeping his hold on Agatha and placed her arms on both the armrests now available to her, choosing to hold them to stake her claim properly.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the lights to dim and the show to start and Rio could only think of the woman two seats away, her husband having moved off of her - because of Agatha’s protests or through his own volition, Rio didn’t know.</p><p>But he couldn’t use the armrest to his right which was barely a victory, but it was something.</p><p>The comedian hosting the night was funny, so much so that Rio didn’t have to fake her laughs as the cameras swung close. But the ceremony was still long, made ever longer by the constant movement of Ralph beside her.</p><p>He was bored, that much was clear. He wasn’t interested in celebrating the wins of Agatha’s cast or crew, and he made sure to be touching his wife in some way when the cameras were near. For that, Rio supposed, she couldn’t blame him. She’d have her hands constantly on Agatha if she could.</p><p>Theirs was the penultimate award, and Rio had a strange feeling in her stomach that felt a lot like nerves. The shock of winning the Globe hadn’t really left her so anything could happen tonight; though the fans, the trades, the critics, all believed the BAFTA was Agatha’s.</p><p>The winner of last year’s Best Actor stood proudly centre stage and twinkled down at the audience before him.</p><p>Rio felt Alice take her hand.</p><p>She saw Ralph do the same with Agatha.</p><p>The nominees were read out. The cameras were honing in. The envelope was being opened.</p><p>“And the BAFTA for Best Actress goes to…”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, kept her smile up on her face, felt Alice dig her nails in.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness!”</p><p>And Rio released the breath she’d been holding, and she stood with the rest of the audience, and she turned just in time to see Agatha being kissed by her husband.</p><p>She kept her smile up, kept clapping, and fought off the need to fight this man then and there. But Agatha met her gaze over Ralph’s shoulder and her need to fight died at the sight of blue eyes.</p><p>Agatha moved over and pulled Rio to her, hugging her close and whispering, “Regretting that little bet?”</p><p>She pulled away and gave Rio a dazzling smile before she turned up to walk up the stairs to accept her award. And Rio <em>was</em> dazzled.</p><p>Agatha <em>was</em> dazzling.</p><p>“Wow. Wow, wow, wow.”</p><p>A Hollywood smile, a sprinkle of humility in her laugh.</p><p>“From British people this just feels so much more special.”</p><p>The audience ate it up.</p><p>“I’ll do the polite thing and keep this short. I…” and Rio caught her eyes, just for a second, and felt a swell of pride in her chest. “I’d first like to thank my fellow actresses, the immense talent in this category, the friendships we’ve forged.” The swell settled and Rio bit down on her tongue, aware of a camera close by. “the admiration I have for you all,” Agatha’s eyes flickered up and Rio caught her gaze again, it held this time, and Agatha smiled a little as she said, “I can’t wait to dance with you later.”</p><p>Rio beamed up at her and Agatha turned just as she caught the smile, just as her own face split into a grin that lit up the whole stage.</p><p>“To my cast, my crew, this is a result of your hard work, your dedication, and your love for this project. Before I go, I’d just like to…” but Agatha’s lips twitched in a way that suggested she was feeling real emotion and Rio wanted to go to her. “I am a mother before I am anything else. And this role made me experience even a tiny piece of what it would be to be a mother without her child and I… to all the mothers, the parents out there, experiencing child loss, of feeling as though your heart is broken outside your body, I see you. I’m holding you. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio watched this married mother of a shy little boy leave the stage and she yearned for her. She wanted to step up there and follow her backstage, to hold her hand and kiss her face. But she sat, beside her husband, clapping with a smile on her face as the cameras remained close.</p><p>In the change over between Agatha leaving and the new presenter arriving, Ralph leant in: “She looks beautiful, doesn’t she? This gorgeous thing that everybody admires, wearing my ring, sleeping in my bed. I’m the luckiest son of a bitch in this audience.”</p><p>It was irrational to be angry, futile to be jealous, but Rio felt both things so viscerally she could have screamed. Maybe it was that she’d been on her knees for Agatha the night before, that she’d confessed her love and still been left alone, but she found she couldn’t respond, she couldn’t even fake a smile, she simply turned away and pressed her lips close to Alice’s ear so no one else could see or hear what she was saying: “I’m going to get drunk tonight.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t return after her win, and Jen had slipped away to go and help her in the press rooms out back.</p><p>The show went on and Rio found herself zoned out, counting down the seconds until she could have a glass of wine in her hand or a shot of tequila burning down her throat.</p><p>When the show came to an end and Rio left her seat before most, pulling Alice with her to escape smalltalk with Ralph. She found Wanda and after exchanging compliments and a quick hug she repeated her promise to Alice from earlier in Wanda’s ear. Wanda was much more encouraging of this behaviour than Alice had been.</p><p>The audience of Hollywood’s elite, of the British talent, of the execs and producers and wallets with legs, all funnelled into the space designated for drinks and debauchery. Some disappeared off to other parties across the city, but Rio held tight to Wanda, caring only that Wanda held her hand close and that she didn’t care who saw it.</p><p>Rio was three glasses of wine deep by the time she saw Agatha again.</p><p>Neither had changed from their ceremony outfits and Rio was once again reminded of the power of a pretty girl in a pretty dress.</p><p>The lights of the room span and flashed and Rio was briefly blinded by them, and missed Agatha’s first steps as she made her way over to her, BAFTA in hand.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda said from her side, her hand still in Rio’s, “We need to pose a little more. Ham it up.”</p><p>“I’m not-…”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Agatha had pulled Rio into her, turned her with one strong arm around her waist, and in doing so Rio automatically dropped Wanda’s comforting hold on her hand.</p><p>“I need to talk to you,” Agatha whispered by her ear, pulling away only to scan over Rio’s surprised face, frowning a little at the sight of drunk eyes.</p><p>“Congratulations!” Wanda announced as she stepped closer and placed a hand on the arm around Rio, “Really, Agatha. And everyone was tearing up at your speech. It was…”</p><p>Agatha moved her arm from Rio, grasping her lapels briefly where she kept her eyes on her rather than on Wanda. And Rio turned away, catching the hurt in Wanda’s eyes and not knowing how to fix it.</p><p>She took Wanda’s hand back in her own when Agatha dropped her hold entirely and said, “Your husband’s over there somewhere. We’re just going to get-…”</p><p>“Champagne, please,” Agatha said, though it was more a demand than a request and Rio looked back around in surprise to see that some of the softness from before was gone. “I’ll wait here for you.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, her lips twitching just slightly as she made to pull Wanda away with her, feeling dizzy with the intensity of it all.</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda insisted as she pressed into her side when they were at the bar and she placed Rio’s hand that had been holding her own to her hip, “Kiss me.”</p><p>Rio blinked, turning to her hopeful friend and seeing what she’d suspected all along writ large across her open features.</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“Tell me why.”</p><p>Rio’s hold tightened a little and she pursed her lips as they were jostled by the people around them fighting for room in the crowded space.</p><p>“Because it would mean more to you than to me.”</p><p>“I’m okay with that.”</p><p>A humourless laugh floated between them that Rio just couldn’t contain and she saw reflected in Wanda’s gaze some of the pain she was feeling.</p><p>“I’m not. Let’s just be friends. Please?”</p><p>Wanda nodded and dropped her gaze so Rio dropped her hold and didn’t reach back out for her hand. They silently fetched drinks and made polite smalltalk with everyone who approached but the air about them had shifted and Rio knew she couldn’t in good conscience reach back out for the comfort of Wanda’s hand again that night.</p><p>They made their way back to Agatha and found her surrounded by well-wishers and sycophants.</p><p>Rio slipped in to pass her champagne over and found the little group opening up for her and Wanda to stand. Agatha had no free hand for Rio to try and take but as the conversation swirled around them, Agatha shifted and Rio glanced at her, seeing her arm flex with effort as she carried the heavy metal mask that was her BAFTA award.</p><p>She didn’t think before she took it from her, holding it to give some relief to the woman beside her who then twisted her wrist to work it out and then squeezed Rio’s arm in gratitude.</p><p>“And Agatha,” someone said as Agatha pulled her hand away from Rio’s arm, “Where’s that charming husband of yours?”</p><p>“Oh, off being charming somewhere else,” Agatha said dismissively, moving so her arm was now pressed against Rio’s holding her award.</p><p>Rio looked over the heads of the crowd to see if Ralph were anywhere near but saw no familiar jawline, heard no barking voice, no sign of his clicking fingers in the air seeking another drink.</p><p>She sipped her champagne, focused on the soft pressure of the woman beside her, only vaguely paying attention to the conversation and adding where she needed to until people began to move along and Agatha muttered, “I hate these things.”</p><p>“You do? You’re so…”</p><p>“What?” Agatha moved to stand before Rio, blocking her from all who dared approach, “Charming? Witty? Eloquent?”</p><p>“I was going to say ‘at ease’, but maybe I mean arrogant.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and shrugged, and Rio fell for her all over again. “Maybe. Years of my mother’s social conditioning.”</p><p>“She must be so proud,” Wanda said innocently, and Agatha turned to her with raised brows, looking almost as if she forgot she were there.</p><p>“She must be.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly, “Wanda earlier was admiring your dress.” Nice, easy, basic small talk would save them all.</p><p>“We all match,” Wanda added with a hopeful smile, picking up what Rio was putting down quickly, “Maybe we should recreate what went so viral at the Globes.”</p><p>“Red on top,” Agatha said with a smile as she touched Rio’s red shoulder, her eyes on Wanda in a way that let Rio know the safety of the small talk manoeuvre had not worked.</p><p>And Rio realised then that Agatha had done it on purpose. She’d worn a dress that would match her tux and Rio suddenly stared down at what Agatha was wearing and raised her arm to wrap around Agatha’s waist, holding her award upright against her hip.</p><p>The impact on her heart was immediate. In the rain outside she’d been too busy admiring to notice. In the glamour of the ceremony she’d been too distracted to see. And now, with Agatha pressed against her side, her pale arm snaking its way around Rio’s shoulders, she saw what she’d missed: she’d matched them.</p><p>The colour was an exact copy, the red of Rio’s blazer bleeding into the red of Agatha’s dress as they pressed together and Rio bit down on her lip as she caught Agatha’s eye.</p><p>She’d turned to her with an amused smile, watching the realisation hit in real time. “Strange how we managed to match.”</p><p>Rio turned away, feeling that dizzy way again that wasn’t a result of the alcohol she’d consumed.</p><p>“So,” Wanda tried again, avoiding looking at how Rio and Agatha fit against each other, “Can we? Some pictures? There’s been some taken already I’m sure but,” and with the confidence only an actress could muster, even in the presence of a woman who was not a fan, and had much more power than her in the industry, Wanda moved over and placed her hands on both of their arms.</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly and Rio felt her flex her hold on her as she turned to Wanda, “Perhaps we should sit.”</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda agreed with a grin that to Rio looked a little frightened, but she continued anyway, “good idea.” And Wanda peeled away, leading the other two who hadn’t yet moved.</p><p>“You matched my tux?” Rio asked quietly, turning a little more into Agatha so they were facing each other properly, the heavy award now resting on the small of Agatha’s back.</p><p>“We should talk, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was soft again, her expression open and if Rio didn’t know any better she might think tortured. But the wine was making her a little hazy around the edges and Agatha was scanning her over, a far cry from the tense woman she’d just been in Wanda’s presence.</p><p>“Are you toying with me?”</p><p>The weight in Rio’s stomach shifted, shrunk, sizzled inside her, but Rio had to know, had to find out if all of this, if Agatha the great and powerful, were stringing her along for her own amusement and colour-matching was just another clever torture device.</p><p>“No,” Agatha shook her head slightly, a deep frown changing her face as she watched Rio think it over, “It’s not a game.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded once, her heart feeling a little lighter when Agatha pressed her palm over it, pressed so firmly Rio thought she might slip her fingers through the fabric, slip them right through her flesh and bone and take what was rightfully hers.</p><p>“We should go,” Agatha whispered as she pressed more firmly, moved a little closer, and Rio gasped at the intensity of her gaze, at the hold she had on her.</p><p>It lasted all of a second longer before Agatha pulled back and took Rio’s wrist to pull her through the noise to find Wanda again.</p><p>And Rio followed dumbly, holding Agatha’s award and the champagne glass that was now almost empty.</p><p>They made their way to a corner and Rio sat beside Agatha only to be told to move into the middle by Wanda but held back by Agatha’s hold on her.</p><p>“She’s fine here.”</p><p>And Rio could only lean over, could only offer Wanda a reassuring smile as she draped an arm over the back of the couch, resting the BAFTA there, turned her body into Agatha’s, and reached her hand holding her champagne over to Wanda’s lap.</p><p>“This is really starting to feel a bit too contrived, no?”</p><p>But Agatha snuck her arm around her waist and suddenly, contrived or not, there was nowhere Rio would rather be.</p><p>“You can leave if you want to,” Agatha said softly, and Rio didn’t dare turn her head for fear she’d faint before her, but she kept her eyes on Wanda, watching as she reached to hold her wrist, leaning in to say in a whisper: “Just three friends enjoying each other’s company.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly but smiled as Wanda did and risked glancing at Agatha. The risk paid off. Agatha’s gaze had been on Rio’s chest and Rio wondered if the angle gave Agatha more to see than her stylist had intended. But blue eyes jumped back up again and Rio smiled at her, enjoying the brief look of embarrassment on Agatha’s face and the fingers that dug into the sensitive spot at her waist that made her jerk a little and pull back.</p><p>“There you are!”</p><p>All three women turned to look up at the man now smiling down at them, a double whiskey in his clutches. “Babe, let’s go make the rounds. I need to show you off.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched and she felt Agatha squeeze her reassuringly, her hand moving slowly away from her, “I’ll catch you later? Don’t get drunk, okay?”</p><p>Rio could only lean back, giving Agatha the space she needed to stand up, but found she’d stopped to press her lips to Rio’s cheek before she did so and brushed the lipstick left her as she whispered more urgently than before, “Por favor mantente sobria.” <em>Please stay sober.</em></p><p>It took her off guard, the earnestness of the request. Rio’s stomach churned at Agatha’s words, and her need to be alone with Agatha flared so desperately in her chest that she could almost cry for it.</p><p>But Agatha left and she knocked back her last dregs of champagne, stealing Wanda’s to finish off too as Agatha and Ralph disappeared into the crowd with her award back in her hand.</p><p>Ralph hadn’t taken it for her. Prick.</p><p>Wanda moved into her side. “The greatest tragedy on earth is that she’s married to that man.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and leant forwards to place Wanda’s glass down, “Isn’t it?”</p><p>“And you know the second greatest?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“It’s that you can’t see what’s right in front of you when she’s around.”</p><p>Rio turned her head and saw Wanda look down, taking Rio’s free hand to hold gently, her fingers toying with Rio’s in a way that made Rio want to die. “You were right before. It would mean more to me. But is that so bad, Rio? I think that you could grow to feel differently about me.”</p><p>“I love you. I’m just not in love with you.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her gaze still down on their fingers, and Rio moved her arm from the back of the couch to drape over her shoulders, pulling her a little closer, “You’ll get over it soon,” she tried gently, ducking her head to try and catch Wanda’s gaze, “I’m not that great.”</p><p>“Oh I know that,” Wanda shot back, gracing Rio with a brilliant smile, “I’m not in love. It’s just a tiny crush, is all. And I was kinda hoping to get laid tonight.”</p><p>Rio released a laugh and rolled her eyes as she leant back in the seat again, “Well you’ve basically got your pick of London, so.”</p><p>“Will Alice let you off your leash enough to come dancing later?”</p><p>Rio smirked as she turned to Wanda, “I’m sure that could be arranged.”</p><p>Rio’s mission then, despite Agatha’s request, was to get as drunk as possible. The prospect of Agatha wanting to talk to her and potentially leave her on her knees again - figuratively or not - loomed larger and larger as time went on and with every glance in the Oscar-winner’s direction, made only slightly more palatable by the dulling affect of the alcohol now flowing bountifully through her veins.</p><p>She managed to keep it together to talk to the right people, charm the important ones, and not make Alice want to string her up by her ankles. It was only Jen who had a vocal problem with her less than sober state.</p><p>“I told you I wanted you with Agatha tonight. Where have you been? Up at the bar by the looks of it.”</p><p>Rio only laughed and draped an arm over Jen’s shoulder, allowing the taller woman to catch her waist as if afraid she’d fall, “Jen. Agatha has been with her shitty husband all evening.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Jen insisted quickly, her hold moving from cautious to firm as she glanced around them and pushed Rio back out of the throng of people nearby. She turned them and took Rio’s hand to pull her clean away, only stopping once they were in a quieter area and she could crowd Rio into the wall to keep her from leaving.</p><p>Rio only watched her in amusement, “What? You think he isn’t shitty?”</p><p>“I think-,” Jen snapped and then released a slow breath, pinching the bridge of her nose as she thought it over for a second, “That you’re drunk and I think Agatha is a grown woman and has made her choices. If one of them happens to be a shitty one then-…”</p><p>“Jen he’s a moron. He couldn’t even get them to the car last night. Couldn’t even…”</p><p>“Look, Rio, I know you’re sweet on her-.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned her face away, looking out over the mass of people all dressed in their finery. It seemed so false to her in that moment, so vacuous and meaningless. No one was wearing a genuine smile. Everyone was fawning, preening, pawing.</p><p>But Jen had moved closer and was holding her arms, her face a little sterner than before. “Rio, I don’t like him anymore than you do.”</p><p>Rio scoffed.</p><p>“But she’s been with him for eighteens years and they have a son together.”</p><p>“She’s miserable.”</p><p>Jen’s fingers tightened briefly against Rio’s arms and Rio turned to look at her, seeing for the first time in Jen’s gaze a strange mix of sadness and resolve. “I know.”</p><p>“Then why-.”</p><p>“Agatha’s complicated. And she has Nicky. Nicky is all she-,” someone moved past, closer than before and Jen glanced around and cleared her throat as she dropped her hold on Rio’s arms and turned her gaze back to her.</p><p>“My makeup artist told me she’s been snappier lately. She’s been morose or angry or-…”</p><p>Jen sighed and glanced around again, brushing down the front of her blue dress in what to Rio looked like an attempt to buy time. “It’s a stressful time.”</p><p>Rio just shook her head and turned away again, leaning fully now against the wall and letting her gaze drift over the sea of people trying to spot the woman she was looking for.</p><p>“I’m going to ask you something. Not as her manager. As her best friend.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze drifted back to Jen and she frowned as she saw the hesitation on Jen’s face, her wide brown eyes unable to quite meet her own gaze.</p><p>“After all this is over, don’t drop her, okay?”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>“No, I know, I… <em>god</em> she’d kill me for saying this but… Rio, you don’t need to tell me anything. I’m not asking for-… just…” but Jen trailed off and Rio’s eyes widened as she took in the woman before her now scanning over her face. “Look, I don’t know what’s going on exactly but I know… I know something is. I’m just asking you to go easy. Please. And to keep… to keep it… please be...”</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and Rio stepped into her to pull her into a tight hug, not trusting her drunk brain to say what she wanted to without letting slip more than she meant. Jen took a second to respond but eventually hugged her back and Rio sighed heavily into it, squeezing her eyes closed.</p><p>“Have I missed something?”</p><p>Standing just a foot away was Agatha, and Rio frowned as she opened her eyes to see her, a blazer draped over her shoulders that she knew must be Ralph’s covering the top of the brilliant red dress that matched Rio’s outfit. She pulled away from Jen and ran a hand through her hair just to give herself something to do.</p><p>“Jen was just,” she started but was unable to think of anything to say so Jen picked up the slack for her: “Just consoling the loser over here. Are you ready to go?”</p><p>“Yeah, can I get a second with the loser first?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and turned away and Jen left them both to it.</p><p>Neither of them moved or said anything for a while until they both spoke at once:</p><p>“Is that Ralph’s?”/“You're drunk?”</p><p>Rio looked over and met Agatha’s soft gaze with a deep frown, unable to look for long until her eyes fell to the man’s blazer over her pale shoulders.</p><p>“I couldn’t exactly take yours,” Agatha said quietly as she moved closer, taking up Jen’s spot now in front of her and reaching to hold Rio’s right hand in her left.</p><p>“You’re drunk,” she said again, though this time it wasn’t a question, a frown returning to her features as her eyes scanned over Rio’s face, though Rio still refused to meet her gaze.</p><p>“Only a little.”</p><p>“I wanted to talk to you.”</p><p>“Right. Well I’m too drunk for that so maybe another time.”</p><p>She looked up then, a fire flaming across her cheeks as she caught Agatha’s tender expression, as the hand that held hers now moved to release it and her fingers pushed beneath Rio’s sleeve to stroke intimately at the soft skin at the inside of Rio’s wrist.</p><p>“When are you leaving tomorrow?”</p><p>“First thing.”</p><p>They were both silent for a while and then, in a voice so quiet and so soft Rio felt her chest tighten at the sound of it, Agatha asked, “Are you pulling away?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed with the weight of her feelings. Her lips parted but no sound came and Agatha’s soft touches to her wrist only made it all worse, because they were secret, hidden from view of anyone else, just for her, just like everything else between them.</p><p>“Rio? I’m sorry for the way I left yesterday. I-…”</p><p>Rio blinked her eyes back open, her chest aching with the need to be alone with Agatha again and she shook her head as she watched her, took a step closer even as Agatha took a smaller one back.</p><p>Rio struggled for words again but found something to say that her drunken mind couldn’t compute hadn’t been part of this conversation: “I’m not shitty.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said quietly, nodding a little. She tore her gaze from Rio and glanced over her shoulder briefly before she turned back to her. “I know you’re not.”</p><p>“And we look good together.” Rio’s free hand raised to vaguely motion between them, the red on red making her feel bolder, and the wine helping stoke the flames of it.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha breathed out, even more softly this time and Rio found she couldn’t look anymore, she just stared down somewhere around Agatha’s mid-section.</p><p>“I’d give you my blazer if you were cold.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha repeated again, her fingers still tickling steadily over Rio’s inner wrist. “You’re not wearing anything underneath it.”</p><p>“That isn’t the point.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio forced herself to look up, dragging her gaze slowly across the expanse of pale skin on offer to her, trailing along a perfect jawline, pausing at a perfect nose, landing finally on swirling baby blues.</p><p>“I want you to leave him.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath, and her cheeks flushed a soft pink, and Rio moved in to pull Agatha to her, dislodging the hand up her sleeve, and instead pressing her arms beneath the blazer that smelled of Ralph.</p><p>But the borrowed jacket gave Rio a semblance of protection from any curious onlookers, the one decent thing Ralph had perhaps ever done in his life, though unwittingly. It meant she could hold Agatha for a little longer, squeeze her tighter, press her as close as she could muster.</p><p>All Rio could feel was Agatha, all she ever wanted to feel was Agatha. And the arms that encircled her neck told her that the woman in her arms wanted her too.</p><p>She just hadn’t said anything, so Rio clung to what she felt rather than what she knew. And she pulled away, leaving her hands on Agatha’s waist, hidden from anyone’s view.</p><p>“I can’t wait forever.” <em>Ask me to.</em></p><p>Agatha nodded imperceptibly, her lips parted but no words passing them.</p><p>“I need to go.” <em>I love you.</em></p><p>Agatha frowned but Rio moved swiftly to press a kiss to Agatha’s cheek and stepped around her before she could do anything else.</p><p>From her peripheral vision she saw Jen watching her, and realised she’d kept close the whole time, watching her client and Rio like a hawk.</p><p>But Rio didn’t have the energy or heart to care who was watching her anymore and she pushed through the hoards of people until she found the person she was looking for.</p><p>“Hey, let’s get out of here. I need to dance.”</p><p>Wanda only grinned in response and took Rio’s waiting hand in her own as they left, two losers in love, into the night.</p>

<p>“God, you’re so fucking hot.”</p><p>Rio had lost track of everything but long hair and a hand beneath her blazer, warm over her breast. Her body thrummed with the music around her, though she could pick out no discernible lyrics, make no decisions as to which artist to thank for their magnificent offering into the wonderful world of noughties pop music.</p><p>It was nice like this, she decided, nice to not think, to be in her body, to experience the feeling of someone against her. She liked being touched.</p><p>Someone was kissing her neck, perhaps the same person who’s hand it was against her skin, perhaps not. It felt good either way.</p><p>The lights of the nightclub provided little relief to the haze Rio was in, making it harder to focus on something solid, something real.</p><p>But the feeling was real, the feeling was <em>good</em>.</p><p>Her mind was empty and she felt like a million fireflies were sparking up inside her.</p><p>“Blitzed” would have been the perfect word to describe it. Though Rio wasn’t sure if it were appropriate to use such a word in London.</p><p>But her brain power was focused on more important things right now, like who was groping her, who was kissing up her neck, and who was shouting her name from close by.</p><p>The perfect little pill had passed her lips not half an hour before and was washed down with warm beer and the hands of a pretty girl encouraging the concoction to slip down her throat. Rio had lost her mind for the sake of soft hands and softer lips - she’d lost her mind for much less before.</p><p>She closed her eyes as the haze grew and the shouting got louder and she felt a tongue reach her ear before it was rudely snatched away and more hands found her head.</p><p>They were harsher but somehow familiar.</p><p>“Feels good,” she mumbled with a lazy, slightly off-kilter grin, her eyes still closed as she felt bodies moving around and on top of her.</p><p>And then, no one was touching her, and she woke with a start, sitting bolt upright in bed, her head spinning and her memory blank.</p><p>The room was familiar but only vaguely so and she turned nervously to see what she could already feel was beside her. There was a wave of red hair splayed out across the pillow just beside where Rio’s head had been and beneath it Wanda Maximoff slept soundly, curled under the heavy duvet.</p><p>Rio glanced down at herself and saw a t-shirt she didn’t recognise, felt below the blankets a pair of shorts that weren’t hers, and cautiously moved to see if Wanda were similarly dressed.</p><p>She was, and so Rio lay back down and reached for her, placing a gentle hand on her side.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio whispered softly, shaking Wanda to get her to rouse, “Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda groaned and rolled onto her other side, squinting over at Rio with a frown that slowly morphed into a smile, “Hey. Feeling okay?”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“You don’t remember?”</p><p>Rio shook her head and began chewing on her lip, noting that they were dry and her mouth felt dry too. Her head was thumping painfully and she realised whatever she’d taken hadn’t been a clean high.</p><p>“I lost you for a bit in the club. You were so drunk I got worried and when I found you I think you’d taken something and this girl was…” Rio’s eyes flashed in panic and Wanda moved her warm hand to Rio’s cheek, “She was feeling you up but you weren’t all there so I took you away and brought you home.”</p><p>“And we didn’t…?”</p><p>Wanda’s smile widened a little and Rio huffed in embarrassment. “No. We didn’t.”</p><p>“I’m sorry you didn’t get laid.”</p><p>“It’s okay. I made out with someone <em>extremely</em> good looking so.”</p><p>“What stopped you going all the way?”</p><p>“I caught sight of my good friend Rio Vidal high on molly and off her face with a random brunette in her lap.”</p><p>Rio groaned and rolled onto her back, hiding her face in her hands, “Jesus.”</p><p>“If it helps at all she was a total-…”</p><p>“Don’t. It doesn’t help.”</p><p>Wanda sighed quietly and Rio felt her shift next to her, and turning she saw she’d leant up on her elbow to smile down at her, “You’re very charming whilst completely off your face. You kept telling me how you were going to propose.”</p><p>Rio frowned, turning to Wanda in complete disbelief, unsure she’d heard her correctly, “Propose?”</p><p>“To Agatha.”</p><p>Wanda said the words like they meant nothing to her, like they were an obvious answer to an obvious question. But Rio hadn’t even admitted to herself - at least when sober - that she wanted to marry Agatha and she had certainly never told anyone else this. Let alone a woman who had just the previous night told her that she had a crush on her. A woman who had protected Rio when she didn’t need to, a woman who was now smiling at her, soft and warm.</p><p>“Oh my god, Wanda.” Rio sat up as sharply as she had when she woke up, only this time she was on her knees before Wanda, her eyes as wild as her hair, though Wanda just looked back at her calmly, a warm smile on her face as she sat back against the headboard. “I was just… I was high I-…”</p><p>“It’s okay. You don’t need to explain. Like I said, it was very charming.”</p><p>Rio groaned and dropped her head into her hands, allowing Wanda to take hold of her wrist lightly, “You love her. You didn’t even say it you were just rambling on about making her happy but I lost you when you went into Spanish.”</p><p>Rio groaned again and flopped down onto the bed, keeping her face covered because she could feel the heat in her cheeks. “That’s so fucking lame.”</p><p>“It’s not. She’s a lucky woman to have someone so smitten.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for a while but she felt Wanda shift and she looked up to see her kneeling beside her with a smile, “Way to let a girl down though.”</p><p>The wind was knocked out of Rio then, at how soft Wanda was, how gracious she was with Rio making out with a stranger then telling her how much she loved someone else. And so she didn’t protest when Wanda leant in slowly and pressed her lips cautiously against Rio’s.</p><p>It was surprising, how good it felt, how soft Wanda’s lips were. How warm the hand was that cupped her cheek, how tender the thumb that brushed the tear that Rio hadn’t been aware she was crying.</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda whispered quietly as she pulled back and Rio blinked owlishly up at her. “I don’t stand a chance, do I?”</p><p>Rio sucked in a soft breath and felt Wanda brush away another tear but shook her head slightly, frowning up at Wanda as if seeing her for the first time.</p><p>“No. No, it’s… it’s just her.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda whispered softly, pulling her hand away, “I just had to check.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only close her eyes and turn her head away as she felt Wanda move back up the bed.</p><p>They were both silent for a while until Rio decided she couldn’t lay around miserable and guilty any longer so she forced herself to sit and look at Wanda curled into herself by the headboard.</p><p>“Thank you for…”</p><p>“Don’t mention it. And don’t worry about any evidence of… y’know, there weren’t any paps around so worst case scenario it’ll be grainy pictures in the club but I didn’t see anyone near you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispered, moving now to kiss Wanda’s cheek, “but I mean it: thank you. Even if you did apparently strip me and put me in your clothes.”</p><p>Wanda laughed and swatted her away, “I didn’t look… much.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Rio smiled as she slid from the bed, momentarily pausing as her centre of gravity shifted and she felt dizzy. But she righted herself and went to sweep the floor for her expensive, and most likely ruined, suit.</p><p>“Safe flight,” Wanda called out from behind her as Rio smiled and slipped out the door onto a random floor in the Ritz. She looked up and down the hallway before she chose a direction and took it until she found the elevator and went to her floor with no option other than to knock on Alice’s door.</p><p>There was no answer for a long while until the door was ripped open and Jen stood before her, and Rio’s heart sank.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio.”</p><p>She was pulled inside.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice announced from where she sat up in bed. Rio hadn’t expected a warm welcome but she hadn’t exactly expected <em>this</em>.</p><p>A hand on her back pushed her further into the room and Alice swung her legs over the side of the bed, her phone in her white-knuckled hand. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Good, because I’d really like for you to explain to me why you were in the middle of a club with some bitch’s hand down your blazer.”</p><p>Rio grimaced, and even if she’d wanted to explain, she wouldn’t have been able to. She didn’t remember whose hands had been where. Or even what club they’d been in.</p><p>“Alice, I-…”</p><p>Jen had moved around her to perch on the end of the bed.</p><p>“Explain, Rio.”</p><p>“Champagne, molly, exhaustion, I… what else is there to explain?”</p><p>“Jesus.”</p><p>Rio turned away and went to curl up on one of the armchairs in the corner, dropping her suit unceremoniously on the floor by her feet before rubbing her face with her hands, “What time is it?”</p><p>“Just after five.”</p><p>Rio could only hold her knees to her chest, staring down at the carpet as she felt the weight of two pairs of eyes on her. It was Jen who spoke first, and Rio’s eyes snapped up to hers when she realised she, at least, wasn’t angry. “Wanda took you home?”</p><p>“Apparently. She said there weren’t any paps.”</p><p>“Good. Good. That’s something.”</p><p>“Are the pictures… are they bad?”</p><p>Alice moved over to her and held out her phone. The screen showed a slightly blurry photo of Rio sitting back with her arms splayed out either side of her and a brunette in her lap, one hand pushed below the opening of her blazer, her face pressed in against Rio’s neck. Rio’s head was tilted back, her eyes closed, her mouth wide open.</p><p>It was embarrassing to say the least.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>“It’s just one, so far but…” and Alice trailed off, her gaze dropping from Rio’s blushing cheeks to a deep bruise on her neck. She reached to brush her hair back and poked it, making Rio hiss, “Holy shit.”</p><p>“We’re <em>so close</em> Rio. So close to getting what we want and you just-…”</p><p>“Alright,” Jen said suddenly, moving over to drape an arm around Alice as Rio covered the right side of her neck with her hand, “okay. It’s done. There’s one picture. It’s not as if someone’s done something illegal… minus the molly… but it’s just a single girl having a good time, that’s all.”</p><p>Rio looked up and caught Jen’s eye and saw that she was smiling just a little, and maybe Rio was still a little drunk but she seemed to be on her side with this and so Rio relaxed slightly, slowly lowering her hand from her neck.</p><p>“I just-…” Alice started with a huff and then caught herself and caught Rio’s gaze, “You’re safe,” she said after a second, “that’s what matters.”</p><p>Rio chewed on the inside of her cheek and watched the thoughts paint a picture across Alice’s face. She waited until they’d settled slightly and then she uncurled herself and reached for her to pull her close and when Alice relented into the hug Rio only held on tighter until she felt Alice give in properly.</p><p>“Mm’sorry,” she mumbled into Alice’s hair, and she felt Alice squeeze her and saw Jen turn away, striding back to the bed to give them some space.</p><p>“I’m sending Wanda flowers,” Alice mumbled, “So many fucking flowers.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and Alice slowly pulled away but braced herself on the arms of the chair so Rio’s hold could remain but they could look at each other properly, “Did you sleep with her?”</p><p>“No. She just put me to bed.”</p><p>“Okay. Did you fuck the girl in the bar?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, “No. Wanda saw what was happening and pulled her off me and took me home.”</p><p>“Maybe a whole orchard or something. Think you can buy those?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but Alice’s lips twitched a little and she leant in to press a kiss to Rio’s cheek. “You need to brush your teeth.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and pushed Alice away then, huffing as she strode through to the bathroom and picked up the first toothbrush she saw - assuming the pink one was Jen’s she avoided that one.</p><p>“Dammit Rio not my-!” But Rio had already emerged with the blue toothbrush hanging from her mouth and Alice just rolled her eyes as she sat back on the bed with Jen. “I know where that mouth has been. I hate when you do that.”</p><p>But Rio just smiled around it and went to perch on the bed beside Alice, brushing her teeth with her toothbrush as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“At least it’s a flattering photo,” Jen yawned out as she squinted at her own phone and zoomed in, “No nip slip either.”</p><p>“Thks,” Rio mumbled around the toothbrush and a little fleck of frothy toothpaste spilled onto her chin. Alice grimaced and shoved at her until she moved back to the bathroom.</p><p>It was as she was spitting up that she heard a knock on the door and she froze, her toothbrush in midair and her lips a whiter shade of pale. She heard the door open and a familiar voice in the room and she wanted suddenly to find a hiding place in the modern, glass-forward bathroom.</p><p>She spat again, rinsed the stolen toothbrush, and wiped her mouth on the back of her hand. In the mirror she stared back at herself, her eyes a little wider than usual, her hair fluffier, more wild than usual, her skin bare and tired looking.</p><p>And there, the evidence of her night, sat purple and obvious against the right side of her neck. She touched it lightly as she heard voices but couldn’t derive meaning from them.</p><p>But she could recognise the new one that had entered the fray.</p><p>She had no choice but to face Agatha, to see why she was in Alice’s room at five in the morning, to hope that she wouldn’t notice the mark of another woman on her neck.</p><p>Just as she moved her hair across her right shoulder Agatha appeared in the door.</p><p>“Hey,” she said softly, her eyes on Rio through the mirror.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and turned slowly to her, forcing a smile, “What’re you doing up?”</p><p>“I wanted to say goodbye but when you didn’t answer your door I thought I should… I just wanted to check you were okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded and gripped the sink behind her for support as her legs began to tremble beneath her. And Agatha was moving into the room, closing the door behind her. It made Rio look away, drop her gaze and chew on her lip, unable to look at Agatha as she stepped closer and tugged at the front of her light grey t-shirt.</p><p>“Is this…?”</p><p>“Wanda’s. I borrowed it.”</p><p>Agatha dropped the fabric like she’d been burned and Rio looked up to catch her gaze then, seeing the flames in her blue eyes. “I got drunk, was off my face, and she took me home and put me to bed, that’s all.”</p><p>But Agatha’s gaze had dropped again, and Rio knew immediately what she was looking at. Her hair had shifted without her realising it and the bruise was now visible to anyone looking close enough. And Agatha was looking closely.</p><p>She reached the hand that had just touched Rio’s borrowed shirt and she brushed back Rio’s hair to see the mark on her skin. Rio gasped quietly when Agatha’s fingers brushed the bruise, much more gentle than Alice had been earlier, and for some reason that meant it was more painful to Rio who’d turned her head away and squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>“I was drunk. I was high. I was-…”</p><p>Rio gasped.</p><p>Agatha’s tongue was easing down the bruise, applying just enough pressure that Rio could feel the sting of it beneath the soft, warm relief. Her left hand was now anchored on her hip and her right had slipped through wild hair to hold Rio’s head back as she worked her tongue until she was satisfied and Rio had released a whimper.</p><p>Agatha pulled back then, her fingers clutching at the base of Rio’s scalp, tugging her hair a little. She felt her nudge her jaw with her nose, a brief moment of tenderness before she placed her lips back to the bruise and her tongue was this time replaced by her teeth and lips.</p><p>The sting was exquisite and almost unbearable but Rio didn’t think that Agatha was trying to make this bearable. She tugged harshly at her hair and sank her teeth into the most tender spot of the mark, adding to it, marking over it, replacing the signature of the other woman with her own.</p><p>Rio had to clench her teeth, and grip the sink behind her to try and stop herself from alerting Alice and Jen to what was going on in the little bathroom.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t stop until she was satisfied. She pulled up a few times to soothe the bruise with her tongue, to check in on her progress, to ensure she had covered every part of it and the mark was now twice the size, twice as angry, but unmistakably Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha was panting softly now against her neck, her grip loosening on her hair, her lips trailing a soft line up to Rio’s ear where she whispered, “Was that Wanda’s?”</p><p>“N-no. Some girl. I… just some girl.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and released her hold on Rio enough so she could turn her head and press into her, her hold relenting on the sink so she could wrap her arms around Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha nudged their noses together and looked at Rio with eyes so black they could have swallowed the sun. “It’s mine now.”</p><p>And Rio could only nod, only swallow thickly, only feel the dull ache of her neck where Agatha had marked over the already tender bruise.</p><p>“Did you fuck her?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Did she leave any of those anywhere else?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha nodded just once and dropped her gaze from Rio, glancing down over Wanda’s t-shirt and shorts and Rio bit down on her lip as she moved her hands to lift Agatha’s head back up so she could meet her gaze, “Agatha, it didn’t mean anything. I was high as fuck.”</p><p>“Did she touch you?” Agatha’s jaw felt tight beneath her palms and Rio frowned at still too-dark eyes, fighting against the urge to either deny deny deny, or tell Agatha that she had put her hands all over her to see what she might do.</p><p>But, having been raised well and for fear Agatha might simply walk away if she caught Rio lying, she sucked in a soft breath and said, “She had her hand on my breast. That’s it.”</p><p>“That’s it?” Agatha repeated flatly, pulling away now to turn from Rio.</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded, watching Agatha with wide, sad eyes. “Baby.”</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em>.” Agatha snapped without looking. Her hands were in her hair, her elbows up and out to the sides, her back ramrod straight. “Don’t call me that.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and dropped her head, trying and failing to take in a slow breath as her heart raced apathetically in her chest, caring only to reach maximum velocity rather than to keep its bearer alive.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio managed to force out, trying to keep her voice steady, “I was basically blacked out. It was only because Wanda-…”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio. Don’t talk to me about Wanda.”</p><p>Rio looked up then and saw that Agatha had turned back around. Her hair was as wild as her eyes and Rio felt small before her, tight with anxiety and pressed closely in on herself by the sink.</p><p>“I have been waiting for you. I was on my knees for you… I didn’t tell you I loved you as a joke, Agatha. I wasn’t just saying it.”</p><p>“Loved?”</p><p>“<em>Love</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s lashes fluttered and she dropped her gaze.</p><p>In the silence that settled between them Rio took the opportunity to study Agatha’s face, absorbing the micro expressions like an ornithologist watching a long-looked for bird. A slight divot in her brow told her that Agatha was thinking, a tightness to her lips told her that she was holding something back, the flex of her jaw meant that she wasn’t in control.</p><p>“Which?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Which breast?” Agatha forced out in a shaking voice and Rio placed her hand over her left breast, watching with a frown as Agatha moved back closer.</p><p>She’d dropped her hands now and Rio moved to brush her hair back from her face, watching curiously as Agatha closed her eyes and leant into the touch, pressing her nose and lips against Rio’s palm.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured as Agatha’s hands moved slowly up her stomach, beneath Wanda’s t-shirt, “are you okay? Are you-…?”</p><p>But she caught her breath as Agatha’s cool hands found her naked breasts and arched up a little onto her hold. Agatha’s eyes flashed open and she watched Rio for a second before she brought her hands back down and pushed her top up.</p><p>Rio could only force herself to breathe still as Agatha dipped her head and pressed a kiss to the underside of Rio’s right breast, exploring the skin there for a second before she began to suck and bite, making Rio have to fight off her moans as she marked her again.</p><p>This time it hurt a little less, but felt just as good.</p><p>Agatha pulled away only when she could see the beginnings of a raw red mark and she kissed her masterpiece before she pulled back up and pressed her lips to Rio’s.</p><p>The kiss was hungry, urgent, and Rio was glad of some sort of release after allowing Agatha to mark her so jealously. Her hands buried in wild hair and her waist was grabbed and held firmly by the older woman.</p><p>As Agatha pressed into her she gasped into her mouth and barely contained a moan that reverberated between them.</p><p>When Agatha pulled away there was a thin line of saliva that linked their bottom lips and Agatha flicked her tongue out to break it off. Rio panted softly before her, scratching at her scalp as Agatha held her firmly still, her hands close to breaking ribs with their hold.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered once she thought she could get the words out without collapsing. Agatha placed their foreheads together and kept her eyes closed. “Alice and Jen are just outside, we can’t…”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha said just as quietly, just as breathily, “Not anymore.”</p><p>Rio frowned and lifted her head up, dislodging Agatha’s and forcing her eyes open to look at her. Her eyes were still dark, but Rio was close enough now to see the green in them, to see that the intensity of them was really masking her fear.</p><p>“Is this a punishment?”</p><p>The words tumbled from Agatha’s swollen lips like a sigh, breathed into Rio’s mouth as she kissed her again.</p><p>Rio kissed her back, leant in as Agatha began to pull away, and frowned when she finally did.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Is this a punishment for leaving you the other night?”</p><p>There was a knock at the door, sudden and sharp and unwelcome. Rio had flinched but Agatha had simply turned into her, pressing her face in against Rio’s cheek, apparently only interested in being close.</p><p>“One minute!” Rio called out to either Jen or Alice, her voice cracking slightly after the time spend holding back moans and whispering.</p><p>“No, Agatha,” she said in another whisper, adjusting her stance more against the sink to pull Agatha between her legs. “I-… <em>no</em>. I’d never do that. That’s not something…”</p><p>But Agatha was shifting against her, her hands moving down to her hips to anchor her in place and she dropped her head to the unmarked side of Rio’s neck and kissed her there once, softly, nuzzling into her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered again, her hand now on the back of Agatha’s head, “I made a mistake. I was out of my mind with <em>hurt</em>, Agatha. I… I just want you.”</p><p>A heavy breath was expelled against Rio’s skin and she closed her eyes at the intimacy of the act, of Agatha pressing a little more into her, of the hands that tightened her hold on her and the hint of a wet tear slipping down to the crook of her neck.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly to encourage Agatha to pull away and she did but she kept her head down, and moved only to wipe quickly at her eyes so Rio wouldn’t see the tears she’d already felt.</p><p>Rio reached for Agatha’s collar and pulled her closer, her free hand moving to cup her cheek, “Baby,” she breathed out and Agatha’s eyes flashed up to meet her own, swirling with tears.</p><p>“Why did you leave me?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted but before she could speak there was another knock at the door and Rio closed her eyes and slumped back against the sink, feeling the soft presence of Agatha against her once more and her lips against her cheek.</p><p>“Jen will make sure nothing comes out about this.”</p><p>Rio turned more into her as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s shoulders and pulled her close, “What?”</p><p>“I’ll get Jen to-…”</p><p>“You don’t need to do that.”</p><p>“I can protect you. Let me.”</p><p>The door opened then and Rio looked with wide eyes as it was pushed to, just an inch or so. “Rio?” Jen’s voice filled the small bathroom, softer than Rio had ever heard it. Agatha pressed her face into Rio’s again. “Alice says you have half an hour before you need to leave.”</p><p>“O-okay, I’ll be right out.”</p><p>Jen closed the door quietly and Rio turned again to Agatha, nudging her gently with her nose before kissing her, “Can I see you back home?”</p><p>“I’m away with Nicky. I wanted some time with him.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispered softly, frowning as Agatha wrapped her arms more securely around her. “Will Ralph-?”</p><p>“No. Just us.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“I,” Agatha started after a second of silence between them, pulling away slightly to scan over Rio’s tortured face, her gaze dropping to the mess she’d made of her throat. “I should let you go.”</p><p>Rio nodded, and leant in to kiss Agatha one last time before Agatha pulled away totally, wiped at her face roughly and with one last, desperate look, she slipped out of the bathroom.</p><p>Rio took a steadying breath and then followed Agatha out, sweeping her hair over her shoulder as she did.</p><p>Back in the bedroom Alice was sitting at the edge of the bed, her face angled down and her hands beneath her thighs but from what Rio could see of her profile she looked as pale as a ghost.</p><p>Against the back wall Jen stood tall, stiff, her eyes staring off into the mid-distance as her hands rested behind her.</p><p>Agatha was striding past both of them, pausing only briefly at the door to turn and announce quietly to the room: “Have a safe flight.”</p><p>Jen looked up then and met Rio’s gaze, and Rio didn’t know whether she’d seen someone look more haunted. Her gaze dropped before Rio could react to her and she turned and left the room without saying a word.</p><p>Rio turned her attention to Alice then and saw that she hadn’t moved at all, hadn’t even turned to look at her or to acknowledge Jen leaving.</p><p>“Your room key is on the desk,” she eventually muttered, still not moving from her position on the bed. Rio moved to grab it, feeling more tension in the room with just her and Alice than she had even when Agatha had entered the bathroom earlier.</p><p>But she said nothing, too focused on thoughts of Agatha to be able to form a coherent thought related to Alice.</p><p>She left the room and went to her own to shower and change and throw all of her belongings into her suitcase.</p><p>There was a knock at the door exactly twenty minutes after she arrived and a member of staff in a crisp burgundy vest had arrived to take her things down to the car that would be waiting to take them to the airport.</p><p>Out in the lobby Rio found Alice waiting for her, an unusual sight without her phone in her hands. She didn’t acknowledge Rio as she approached her and instead led her out to the car without a word.</p><p>Two lone photographers were there to greet them but Rio kept her head down as she stepped into the foggy London morning and slipped into the car.</p><p>She’d done a half-decent job of covering the bruise on her neck but kept her hair swept over it for fear anyone with enough interest in her would spot it. Certainly Alice would see that it had grown.</p><p>The journey to Heathrow was silent, and Rio felt a familiar guilt churning in her stomach but whether for what had happened with the girl in the club or the silent treatment she was receiving from Alice she didn’t know.</p><p>By some miracle Alice’s seat in First was two rows behind Rio so she didn’t have to concern herself with trying to think of something to say across the aisle on the flight home.</p><p>Instead she borrowed a sleeping pill from a nearby passenger - and older lady who looked trustworthy enough that Rio felt sure it <em>was</em> a sleeping pill - and she slept soundly for the eleven hour flight back to LAX.</p><p>By the time she stepped through the door to her home, it had been almost fourteen hours of silence between herself and Alice. And Rio was beginning to wonder which of them would break first. Whilst she wanted to speak to her friend she didn’t trust herself to say the right thing and so she kept her mouth shut, and just as her front door was shut too, Alice broke it: “Rio, have you seen this?” She held up her phone.</p><p>Though of course she knew she hadn’t. Rio’s phone sat, as usual, untouched and unchecked somewhere in her carry on. She hadn’t looked at it since Heathrow.</p><p>But there, bright and obnoxious on Alice’s screen was a picture that Rio would have happily avoided forever if she were given the choice.</p><p>It was a picture of Agatha and Nicky, and Ralph. They were bundled up in sweaters and jackets and scarves and out for a walk in a park. Ralph had his arm around Agatha and Agatha was holding Nicky’s hand, though the little boy was just out of shot, but in the next photo he was there, with Agatha crouching beside him, his Celtics cap on his head, his face angled down as he fed the ducks. They looked perfect. Beautiful. Happy.</p><p>Ralph looked tall and masculine and handsome. In the next shot Agatha was turned into him, face up, smiling at him as if she loved him, as if this were a normal day in the park with her little family.</p><p>It made Rio’s stomach churn.</p><p>Rio turned away just as Alice said: “Jen organised a pap walk for them in Regent’s Park. Nicky fed the ducks.”</p><p>“I saw,” Rio deadpanned, “She let him be photographed?”</p><p>“Not technically. Not his face, anyway.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, keeping her eyes away from Alice so she wouldn’t see how three such simple pictures could destroy her.</p><p>“You’re having an affair?”</p><p>Her tone was light, breezy, as if the silence between them had been nothing, as if she’d asked her what she wanted for dinner that night. But the question still came out of nowhere and Rio turned to her and saw that Alice still looked pale, and she wasn’t quite meeting her eye.</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded just once, making Alice look up to her and meet her gaze for the first time since they’d left London.</p><p>“You should have told me.”</p><p>“You know I couldn’t.”</p><p>Alice nodded and looked away again and Rio turned to go to the kitchen and grab a bottle of water, just for something to do.</p><p>“Well Jen says you don’t need to worry about any furore around that picture of you. She’ll be showcasing Agatha for a couple days. People are more interested in access to her than you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly.</p><p>“Will she leave him?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Alice had followed her.</p><p>“Did Jen know?”</p><p>“I… don’t think so. Maybe suspected but… no I don’t think so.”</p><p>Rio leant back against the counter and opened the Evian. Alice moved over and held her chin gently to tilt her head away, her free hand moving to smudge the makeup working its hardest to cover the angry mark on Rio’s neck.</p><p>“She did this?”</p><p>“Made it worse,” Rio said quietly, a blush rising from her chest to her cheeks.</p><p>“Does she love you?”</p><p>Alice had stepped back again and Rio bit the inside of her cheek and looked away, “I’m not sure.”</p><p>Alice went silent again and Rio kept her gaze on the floor, now toying with the cap of the bottle that hung from its spindly plastic tie.</p><p>“Who couldn’t love you, Rio?”</p><p>Rio looked up, suddenly breathless, seeing her best friend frowning over at her, pale and confused but sure and soft. She put the bottle down on the counter beside her and stepped into Alice’s open arms to bury herself in her embrace.</p><p>Alice stayed with Rio that night and for the first time in a while she held her as she slept.</p><p>By morning Rio was groggy and aching, her body’s reaction to a stressful few days. Alice was curled up the other side of the bed, having drifted in the night away from the heat of Rio’s warm body.</p><p>And Rio watched her friend sleep for a while, looking peaceful and at ease. They’d barely spoken after Alice’s realisation and Rio was grateful for it, because the only words she wanted to say were to Agatha and they were myriad and meant too much.</p><p>That day, over coffee and toast, Jen arrived straight from the plane. She looked calm and cool and greeted Alice as she usually would but greeted Rio with a hug that felt both alien and welcome.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek and whispered into her ear, “She told me everything.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t respond because being open with Agatha was all she wanted and now she had two people she could be in a room with and scream about her love for her. But she wasn’t there to witness it, she wasn’t there to share in the release, so Rio remained silent.</p><p>Jen and Alice hovered around her all day, neither bringing up the topic Rio knew they wanted to, but neither leaving her alone for more than five minutes.</p><p>By the time evening fell and Jen looked like she were on her last legs, they decided to leave.</p><p>When alone Rio opened a bottle of wine and drank all of it until she was able to fall asleep.</p><p>She woke to a text.</p><p>6:03am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: We’re in Barcelona. Nicky’s practicing his Spanish. Thought I’d pick you up a dictionary so you can improve too?</p><p>6:05am<br/>
Rio Vidal: You told Jen?</p><p>6:13am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Are you mad?</p><p>6:14am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Relieved</p><p>6:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I come home the day before the SAGs but I’ve booked a suite at the SLS. Will you stay with me?</p><p>6:17am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: My driver can pick up an overnight bag for you and drop it off.</p><p>Rio hadn’t known what to do. She had two coffees before she text back.</p><p>7:05am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Do you think there’s any world in which I’d refuse?</p><p>7:06am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Took you long enough.</p><p>7:07am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Can I call you?</p><p>7:11am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’ll call after Nicky’s in bed.</p><p>Rio calculated that that may be another three to four hours so she showered and went for a run, keeping her phone in her hand the whole time. She showered again when she was back and waited impatiently for her phone to buzz.</p><p>Three and a half hours after Agatha’s text, it did.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Rio. ¿Cómo estás?”</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>“That bad, huh?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and sat down on the edge of the couch. “You don’t miss me?”</p><p>“You know I do.”</p><p>“It’s nice to hear it.”</p><p>There was silence for a few seconds and Rio chewed on her lip.</p><p>“How’s your neck?”</p><p>“Bruised. You went a bit overboard.”</p><p>“Jen showed me the picture.”</p><p>“God.”</p><p>“Did you know how cheap it is to hire an assassin these days?”</p><p>“So you can freely admit to wanting to kill a girl who gave me a hickey but not tell me you miss me?”</p><p>“It’s different.”</p><p>“Tell me how.”</p><p>“Will you send me a picture of it?”</p><p>“You’re insane.”</p><p>“I felt like I couldn’t breathe when I saw you.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and suddenly <em>she</em> couldn’t breathe. Her hold on the phone tightened a little. “Agatha.”</p><p>“No, I don’t think you understand how-…”</p><p>“I felt it, Agatha. You were biting me, remember?”</p><p>Agatha huffed quietly and Rio wished she were with her, feeling the exhale against her bruised neck.</p><p>“You gotta understand that’s how I feel when I see you with Ralph.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a while and Rio sighed out as she finally answered: “The pap pictures were so that attention was on me, rather than you. I wouldn’t usually-…”</p><p>“I hate seeing him with you.”</p><p>“I was trying to protect you.”</p><p>“I don’t need-…”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said, a little harsher than before, “I won’t do it again.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip, “The difference,” she said quietly, “is that you can give me a necklace and a hickey and I can’t give you anything.”</p><p>In the silence that fell Rio began toying with the fabric of her t-shirt. It dragged on, though she heard Agatha moving on the other end of the phone.</p><p>“This isn’t how I want it to be.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was soft again and Rio could only nod in the empty room, only suck in a short breath as she said: “Then change it.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“You can’t be jealous over me and not-…”</p><p>“It’s complicated.”</p><p>“I know that.”</p><p>“I have to think of Nicky.”</p><p>“Nicky would be better off far away from your asshole of a husband.”</p><p>“You think I don’t want that?”</p><p>“I don’t know what you want anymore.”</p><p>Silence. Silence so heavy that Rio felt it in the sting of her eyes, in the hollow of her chest.</p><p>“I told Jen everything.”</p><p>Rio sighed softly, wondering why Agatha’s limit was always Rio’s starting line.</p><p>“You said.”</p><p>“She’s being horribly gentle. Like she might spook me if she raises her voice or something.”</p><p>“How do you feel?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Agatha. You’ve told your oldest friend that you’re-… that you’re gay.”</p><p>“I didn’t.” Agatha’s voice was sharp suddenly, and Rio closed her eyes at the defensiveness.</p><p>“Okay, that we’re having an affair.”</p><p>Silence down the line again filled Rio with dread and she began to spin her hair around her finger, praying Agatha wouldn’t just hang up.</p><p>“You owe me a post on your Instagram, don’t think I’ve forgotten.”</p><p>In spite of herself Rio smiled just a little, “I haven’t. I believe you owe me two things though.”</p><p>“What’re those?”</p><p>“You said in your speech you couldn’t wait to dance with me. And you said you’d send me a picture of you in those teeny tiny panties.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and Rio smiled more, relaxing where she sat. “I’m on vacation with my son.”</p><p>“You have a separate room, surely? At least a bathroom.”</p><p>“Anyway, this dance.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but sighed dramatically with it, “You going to refuse that now too?”</p><p>“Well, seeing as you’ll be most likely found on the dance floor at the after party anyway…”</p><p>“You’ll dance with me?”</p><p>“As long as it isn’t slow or-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>, you’d <em>love</em> to slow dance with me. Besides, slow dances are an excuse to feel someone up and I just <em>know</em>-…”</p><p>“You’re so goddamn arrogant.”</p><p>Rio grinned into her phone, “Agatha Harkness wants to dance with me. Who wouldn’t be arrogant about that?”</p><p>“You’re so…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then groaned and Rio grinned at the sound of it, twirling the hair around her finger a little more rapidly, “So irritating.”</p><p>“Admit it, you love it.”</p><p>Agatha only hummed, and Rio dropped her hand from her hair, letting them sit in comfortable silence this time for a while before she asked, “Was there something you still wanted to talk to me about?”</p><p>The silence shifted back and Agatha didn’t say anything for a while until: “Not now, Rio. When I’m back.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“So,” Rio said cautiously, after some more silence. “That picture.”</p><p>“I am not… fine. Fine. Maybe after I’ve had some wine I’ll-…”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>Rio laughed and chewed on her lip, “Well I’ll see the real thing in a week or so. Maybe I can wait.”</p><p>“Maybe?”</p><p>“I’ll have to.”</p><p>“No more women straddling you in nightclubs?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“It’s just a question.”</p><p>“Is it still bothering you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“It clearly is.”</p><p>Agatha went silent again and Rio began toying with her hair once more. “Is that why you booked a room for after the SAGs? So you’d know where I was?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything and Rio closed her eyes, “Agatha. You don’t trust me?”</p><p>“I want time for just us.”</p><p>Rio sighed and rolled her head back on the couch.</p><p>“Is it wrong to want to be the girl on top of you?”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched a little but she didn’t say anything, wondering what else Agatha would admit in the quiet.</p><p>It didn’t take long.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about everything I want to do to you.”</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“You can’t just stop there.”</p><p>“Why not? Isn’t a bit early there for phone sex?”</p><p>“Depends. Are you touching yourself?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“A little breathier next time, please.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and Rio grinned.</p><p>“I want to save your moans for when I’m with you, if that’s okay with you.”</p><p>Rio huffed softly, “Well will you tell me everything you want to do to me when I see you?”</p><p>“And I might show you too.”</p><p>Rio groaned, “Don’t do this to me.”</p><p>“I don’t think you’ll be saying that in a week.”</p><p>“God, <em>you</em> are irritating.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and Rio heard the smile on the face even when she couldn’t see it. “I should let you go and get on with your day.”</p><p>“This is the best part of my day.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re doing it again.”</p><p>“Not being shitty?”</p><p>Agatha sighed and Rio chewed on her lip again, wishing she could be where Agatha was.</p><p>She decided to be brave and asked: “I’ll call you in a couple days?”</p><p>“Not tomorrow?”</p><p>“You want me to?”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while again and Rio found herself toying with her hair once more.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“It’s a date.”</p><p>“Bye, Rio.”</p><p>“Te amo, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha suck in a breath and then she was gone.</p><p>They called then. Every day. Twice a day. Sometimes three times. One time Rio called and Nicky picked up and she spoke to him whilst Agatha was busy making snacks and even when she heard her come back she continued to talk to the little boy about nothing more exciting than the things he’d seen on his vacation. And during these calls, even the one with Nicky, she felt whole again. She felt anchored in Agatha’s voice, felt tethered to her, and warmed where she knew for those few stolen minutes of her day she had Agatha’s undivided attention. It was during these times that she forgot Agatha had left her alone, on her knees, after her love confession. Because the woman who she spoke to three times a day wouldn’t do that to her, would never leave Rio wanting or hurt or alone.</p><p>One time Agatha called so late in the day, so late that it was the middle of the night for her, and Rio was out for drinks with Alice.</p><p>She excused herself to the bathroom to take the call.</p><p>“Hey. Everything okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was husky when she answered: “I just couldn’t sleep.”</p><p>“So you called me?”</p><p>“Evidently.”</p><p>“Anything the matter?”</p><p>“It’s three days until we see each other again, you know.”</p><p>Rio smiled and turned to catch herself doing so in the mirror above the three sinks of the little bar in downtown LA. “I know. I’ve been counting down the minutes.”</p><p>“What’re you wearing on Sunday?”</p><p>“I’m sure you already know, considering you made sure to match our outfits last time.”</p><p>“I’ve been busy on vacation. Tell me.”</p><p>“It’s bronze. You’ll love it.”</p><p>“Bronze?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“Tell me why I’ll love it.”</p><p>“No. You’ll just have to wait and see.”</p><p>Agatha groaned on the other end of the line and Rio grinned at herself in the mirror. “It better be worth the wait.”</p><p>“Oh, I think it will be.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly and Rio heard the shuffling of sheets, “What time is it? Three?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded a little and she dropped her gaze from herself to the porcelain sink before her. “You sound tired.”</p><p>“I’m okay.”</p><p>“Well if I were there, you know what I’d do?”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“I’d pull the sheets all the way up, so it’s just us. Just us and nothing else. And I’d pull you into me, cradle your head against my chest, and run my fingers through your hair.”</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Is this your phone sex chat?”</p><p>“No, this is my encouraging you to relax and sleep chat.”</p><p>“Significantly less fun.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> are the one who refuses to have phone sex with <em>me</em>.”</p><p>“Maybe I’ve changed my mind.”</p><p>“I’m out at a bar right now.”</p><p>“So that’s a no?”</p><p>Rio grinned and glanced over her shoulder to triple check she was alone. “Agatha.”</p><p>“Breathier, please.”</p><p>“Very funny.”</p><p>“What if I just started just touching myself?”</p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her neck and checked over her shoulder again, “You can’t do that to me.”</p><p>“Actually I’m doing it to myself.”</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha. Don’t.”</p><p>“Ooh,” Agatha crooned, “Say that again.”</p><p>Rio laughed and turned around to lean back against the sink, “Jesus. You’re going to be the death of me.”</p><p>“Lucky for you I’m too cosy to do that right now.”</p><p>“See but now I just wish I were cosy with you. So that’s just as bad.”</p><p>“Three days.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and maybe it was the two martinis in her system but she said: “Do you think there’s a world in which we’re in bed together every night?”</p><p>“I hope so.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked up when someone entered the bathroom and she smiled at them before she turned to the mirror and pressed her phone a little harder into her ear. “You should sleep.”</p><p>“Call me tomorrow?”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>“Night, Rio.”</p><p>“Te amo, cariño.”</p><p>Rio went back out to the bar with a spring in her step, and her steps became springier and springier the closer it got to the SAGs.</p><p>Alice didn’t have to ask this time. She knew exactly what was going on.</p><p>Her and Jen had agreed to keep Rio and Agatha together as much as possible, giving them as much time - even if they had no space - to be close as they possibly could.</p><p>Separately, they’d promised their managers they’d behave, that nothing would change with how they behaved now that two people had been let in on the secret.</p><p>And Rio was surprised by how calm Alice was about all of this. How little her eyes bugged out every time Agatha’s name was mentioned in her presence, or how steady her voice was when she asked Rio how she was feeling. And how little she asked about Wanda being her PR girlfriend now. So little in fact, she’d not mentioned Wanda’s name since Rio had shown up to her hotel room with a hickey and a hangover.</p><p>“You look so ridiculously hot,” Alice was shouting across Rio’s bedroom from where she lay on the bed with an iced latte in her lap and her phone ever-present in her clutches.</p><p>“Put your tongue back in your mouth, Wu!” Rio shot her friend a wink over her shoulder, practically bouncing off the walls with excitement as someone behind her adjusted her straps.</p><p>The dress custom made for her by the ateliers at Versace was bronze and shimmery and had a centre-front cutout with a crossed neckline. It showed off her abs and a little hint of boob and she knew Agatha would go mad for it because everyone who’d already seen her was practically drooling.</p><p>And <em>she</em> knew she looked good - she had eyes.</p><p>Her stylist had made her hair bouncy and her makeup matched her dress to make her look like a seventies siren.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice called out again as Rio was turning back to check herself out in the mirror. “Jen wants to speak to you.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>Rio blinked as Alice pressed her phone firmly against her ear and Jen’s voice sounded out, “Hey. I need to talk to you about tonight.”</p><p>“Not Alice?”</p><p>“No. And Agatha doesn’t know I’m talking to you so, this is just us now, okay?”</p><p>“Jen, what’s going on?”</p><p>“She’s happy, Rio. You make her happy. I thought I was seeing something and then… well, you weren’t exactly quiet in the bathroom in London and-…”</p><p>“Jen, what is it.”</p><p>“Are you in love with her?”</p><p>Rio frowned and looked around her, pulling the phone down to speak to the woman down at her feet, fussing over her hem. “Could you just…?”</p><p>And they moved away, the woman doing her hair at the back moved too, and Rio was left alone by the mirror with Alice perched not far away on the end of the bed.</p><p>“Hey,” she said breathlessly, unsure why her heart rate had suddenly picked up. “Yes. I am. Why are you asking?”</p><p>“She told me you’d told her and I just… are you, Rio? It’s not just-…”</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>. You’re scaring me. What the fuck is going on?”</p><p>“Just tell me again.”</p><p>Rio sighed and glanced at Alice. “I love her. More than I’ve ever loved anyone. So much that it physically hurts. Are you happy now?”</p><p>“No, I’m not <em>actually</em> happy about any of this but I want you to please remember how you feel. Keep in mind that she’s happy, that she’s actually probably never been happy, outside of Nicky anyway and so-…”</p><p>“Jen. This isn’t making me less scared.”</p><p>Jen sighed quietly, and Rio felt her heart stutter in her chest, “I’m not trying to scare you. I’m asking you to keep in mind that… that she’s softer than she looks, and… you could destroy her.”</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply as Jen finished and she looked at Alice again, watching her frown up at her in confusion. “Jen-…”</p><p>“I’m her friend right now, okay? This isn’t a PR request this is just…  I’m just watching out for her.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and felt a light hand on her side and knew it must be the only person left in the room: Alice.</p><p>“Has something happened?”</p><p>Jen was silent for a second and then: “Just remember she’s happy. She’s not used to that. And she wants more of it and-…”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>“I’ll see you at the theatre, Rio.”</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>.”</p><p>Rio frowned down at the phone when Jen hung up without another word and Alice soundlessly reached for it. “What was that about?”</p><p>“Jen asking me not to hurt Agatha. But it sounded like… I don’t know…” she trailed off and turned to see the worry across her features in the large mirror.</p><p>“She’s probably being protective, that’s all,” Alice said gently, but Rio didn’t think she sounded convinced. “I’ll have a word with her.”</p><p>“No,” the word came out sharper than she meant it to, “Don’t. I want tonight to be easy. To be drama free. I’m just going to sit and smile and maybe get a dance with her. I don’t want anything to ruin it. She was being protective. It’s fine.”</p><p>Alice could only nod at her friend, squeezing her arm supportively before she went to fetch the glam squad to come back in and make the finishing touches.</p><p>Once Rio was as perfect as perfect could be, the glam squad left, and they passed by a man at the door in a crisp black shirt who’d come to fetch an overnight bag. Alice got it for him and didn’t exchange a word, unable to come up with the right thing to say to a man who was helping her friend have an affair.</p><p>On the way to the Shrine Auditorium downtown, Alice finally broke her silent streak. “I want you to know that I’ve been thinking about the many, many things that could go wrong with this.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“No, listen. It would be a dumpster fire, Rio. It could absolutely fucking-…”</p><p>“Yes, got it.”</p><p>“I want you to know that I <em>have</em> you. That I didn’t have you before. But I do now. And if it comes to it, and I’m not saying it will, but if it does… I have you over Jen too.”</p><p>Rio turned to her sweet friend and hesitated for just a second before reaching out because reaching out meant admitting that it could go wrong. It meant acknowledging the very real, very persistent part of her that told her this couldn’t last much longer. Because Agatha had so stolen her heart, but the thief had left nothing to replace it.</p><p>“Alice,” Rio whispered, her hands not quite able to take Alice’s, but instead both sets of fingers gently tapping at Alice’s thigh. “I promise that whatever happens, I’ll make sure that the fallout-…”</p><p>“You’re in too deep, Rio. If it were Wanda, that would be different. Hell, anyone else… but not… <em>her</em>. She’s too powerful.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and found the strength to take Alice’s hand, “She wouldn’t do anything to hurt me. She’s not like that with me.”</p><p>Alice tightened her hold on Rio’s hands, squeezing them gently, “I’m just saying, I’ve got you. For anything at all. Whatever you need. We’ll work through it.”</p><p>Rio looked up and smiled a little, squeezing Alice’s hands right back.</p><p>“And hey, maybe after you get this Oscar she’ll be-…”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em> getting the Oscar.”</p><p>“Listen, if it were ethical I’d have put down my savings on it. Agatha made sure the actors branch-…”</p><p>She trailed off and Rio looked at her curiously, “Holy shit I’m such an idiot. I <em>knew</em> it was insane for her to call you her favourite actress in an interview. What the fuck.”</p><p>Rio laughed and ripped her hands away, “But maybe I <em>am</em> her favourite actress <em>and</em> she likes to kiss me.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Alice said, too in awe of her own blinkered worldview to react.</p><p>“That was before we’d even done anything, anyway.”</p><p>“Fuck me,” Alice muttered quietly, now staring out the window and thinking of interactions past. “And in Italy you we’re being so weird. Jen asked if you were trying it on and if Agatha would be safe sharing a bed with you and I-…”</p><p>“Jesus. Jen thought I’d what? Assault her or something?”</p><p>“I think more just that you’d get a good look at Agatha Harkness in a slip or something.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed, “She doesn’t sleep in a slip.”</p><p>A well-aimed poke to her ribs made her jolt and laugh, “I hope you packed sexy underwear for tonight. It might be your last chance at romance before filming starts.”</p><p>“We’re taking a week away. Before I have to work again. Just the two of us.” Rio turned then and smiled a little at Alice who looked surprised, “She’s booking someplace where we can just be alone.”</p><p>“You have lines to learn and-…”</p><p>“I know. I’ll take my script and it’ll be fine.”</p><p>Alice sighed quietly but nodded, “Okay. Just make sure you actually check your phone. It’s one thing to disappear but another to go off grid on me.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio said with a smile, though she realistically had no plans to be on her phone whilst away with Agatha. She would have more important things to be focused on.</p><p>“The other thing,” Alice said after a little while longer of quiet in the SUV, “is that I was thinking about what this would do to Agatha.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, look at it this way, she’s married, she’s got a kid, it would-…”</p><p>But the car had come to a sudden halt and the noise of thousands of fans lined up to see their favourite celebrities was enough to make Alice’s words die on her tongue.</p><p>She leant across Rio to look out the tinted window and frowned at the sight. No matter how many times either of them did this, neither would be used to it.</p><p>Rio stepped out of the car and arrived to a roar from the waiting fans and photographers. It stupefied her for a second. Her eyes temporarily blinded in the chaos of the red carpet. It was getting worse, she realised, with every awards show. More photographers, more screams.</p><p>But Alice was guiding her gently through, leading her to the entrance of the carpet where a stressed looking woman with a headset ticked off something on a clipboard and pointed to where they needed to be.</p><p>It wasn’t raining like London. There weren’t great hoards of people gathered under large umbrellas. Instead the carpet was wide open and slots were available to the talent moving in slow droves to take their places for the waiting, hungry photographers.</p><p>Rio moved up, taking precedence over some of the others in the long line to join the fray. She was ushered ahead, whispering soft apologies to those she overtook, smiling at those she recognised, and squeezing those she knew.</p><p>And then, just ahead of her, she saw Agatha for the first time.</p><p>She wore a black strapless dress with a peplum at her hips that accentuated her waist. Agatha was posing with her hand on her hip and Rio saw something that made her heart flutter.</p><p>Agatha was wearing an emerald ring on her wedding finger - the green standing out against the black and drawing her eye immediately.</p><p>Rio’s heart didn’t settle as she was directed to the middle of the carpet again, just a few metres down from Agatha. She posed, avoided looking, smiled for the cameras, avoided looking, straightened her back, avoided looking, kept her eyes forward, avoided looking, her teeth visible.</p><p>The shouts got louder and there was a hand on her hip, a warm thumb just grazing the skin of her stomach, a voice in her ear that drowned out all else: “Rio Vidal.”</p>

<p><em>“Agatha!! Over here!!”</em></p><p><em>“Rio!! Rio!!”</em></p><p>The shouts were deafening.</p><p>Agatha’s star power was of a magnitude that Rio still just couldn’t comprehend. And the photographers were rabid for it as she shined her light on Rio.</p><p>And Rio laughed as Agatha grinned at her, as she pulled her hand away making sure to brush along her front, the feel of her touch on her skin making the choice of dress oh-so worth it.</p><p>The impact was immediate, Agatha turning to the photographers, the shouting thunderous amongst the star shine.</p><p>But Agatha was now at her side, her arm around Rio from behind, her gaze towards the men capturing the stellar collision through their DSLRs.</p><p>Rio’s smile was no longer practised or poised but genuine and bright. She found herself slip her own arm around Agatha too and she posed with her, feeling the tender squeeze at her side that was just for her.</p><p><em>“Give her a hug!!</em></p><p><em>“Agatha!! Over your shoulder!! Agatha!!”</em></p><p>Rio began to laugh again as the shouts showed no sign of abating and Agatha squeezed her more tightly, turning her head to see the laughter for herself.</p><p>“Something funny about posing with me?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and leant her top half back a bit, grinning where Agatha clearly began to struggle to keep her eyes up on her face, “Hilarious.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, and Rio continued to grin.</p><p>But a hand that wasn’t Agatha’s was on her back and Alice had moved in, causing the photographers to yell things other than their names.</p><p>“Let’s move along please, ladies. You have all night together, remember.”</p><p>Rio laughed once more and Agatha just rolled her eyes as she pulled away, capturing Rio’s fingers in hers and not letting go until the last second; David reaching for the god in his brain.</p><p>“Some solo shots,” Alice instructed with a half-smile up at Rio, leaving her alone to do as instructed.</p><p>And Rio did. She posed with a warmer, more easy smile than before, half paying attention to the instructions yelled her way and half keeping an eye on Agatha as she too posed and moved up the carpet.</p><p>Midway along the interviews began and Rio dazzled her way through them, always aware that Agatha was no more than two feet away. Sometimes Jen was between them. Sometimes she could reach out and touch Agatha’s skin.</p><p>Sometimes an interviewer would reference Agatha and Rio felt her turn her way as Rio tried to keep her gushing to a minimum - though she wasn’t always successful at that.</p><p>Agatha left the carpet before she did. Her routine was much more nailed down than Rio’s and Jen much stricter on the outlets she’d allow her client to do interviews for than Alice was.</p><p>Agatha was a different echelon of movie star after all; a supernova to Rio’s dwarf star.</p><p>So she was taken into the auditorium long before Rio was and Rio was left to continue her job without the comforting presence of Agatha nearby.</p><p>She did it well, she made the journalists laugh and she answered every question as if she <em>weren’t</em> PR trained and instead was just naturally savvy on the complex politics of a movie about a wayward woman at a time when most movies were about men and their uninteresting problems.</p><p>And soon she was ushered into the hall where the ceremony was to be held, and as usual, her eyes swept across heads and bodies until she could find Agatha.</p><p>There she was, standing by a beautifully set table, a glass of champagne in her left hand, her emerald ring prominent on her finger, her eyes on Rio.</p><p>It stopped Rio in her tracks. So much so that Alice collided with her back and Rio turned to her in surprise.</p><p>“Stop staring. It’s insane to me I never caught on.”</p><p>“Too busy checking out Jennifer.”</p><p>Alice smirked but turned Rio back around and pushed her towards a small group of studio higher ups that contained the one and only Tony Stark. And Rio had no choice but to go where she was led.</p><p>“Ah! The woman of the hour!”</p><p>Rio could only grin, only accept the compliment because she had no means of denying it. But she also accepted a glass of champagne, which made the whole thing a lot easier.</p><p>“We were just talking about you. Got some good news coming your way, kid.”</p><p>“Oh? Do tell.”</p><p>“Can’t I’m afraid. But let’s just say, we had high hopes for <em>Snow</em> and they’re about to skyrocket.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and glanced across at Alice who was sipping her own champagne and looking just as confused as she felt.</p><p>“Very enigmatic,” Rio said just as she felt a hand on her hip and a body against her opposite side. Agatha.</p><p>She turned with a grin and saw that Agatha was looking a little pale, her eyes on Stark. “Stark.”</p><p>“Harkness,” Stark said with a wide smile, “What a coincidence.”</p><p>But Rio couldn’t see how Agatha appearing just then <em>could</em> be a coincidence so she frowned a little and caught Agatha glance around at her.</p><p>“Mind if I borrow Rio? Girly things to discuss, you know.”</p><p>Stark nodded quickly and waved his hand to dismiss them and Rio found herself being tugged away by Agatha with Alice following meekly behind them.</p><p>“‘Girly things’?” Rio asked when they were far enough away to be out of earshot.</p><p>“I wanted to steal you,” Agatha said with a shrug as she dropped her hold on Rio and stepped back. “Couldn’t find a dress that would match your necklace?”</p><p>Rio grinned as Alice gasped beside her, “That green one? Holy shit. What is <em>wrong</em> with me?”</p><p>Rio spared her best friend a look of amusement and then turned to Agatha and caught her checking her out. “My eyes are up here, Harkness.”</p><p>“Harkness, is it?”</p><p>“Stark calls you that. Why can’t I?”</p><p>“I prefer-…”</p><p>“Baby?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flushed a soft pink that drew Rio’s attention and she saw suddenly the thing she always looked for, the sign that she was beginning to realise meant Agatha was hers for the night. She could see the tiny, darker pigments of skin across her pink cheeks and perfect nose and her heart fluttered at the sight.</p><p>“The two of you,” Alice said quietly, moving a little closer even as Rio continued to fixate on the sprinkle of freckles across Agatha’s face, “are so fucking obvious-…”</p><p>“Alice?” Agatha asked suddenly, breaking eye contact with Rio to look down at Alice with a movie star grin, “Could you please give me Rio’s phone?”</p><p>Rio blinked, raised her brows, stepped back a little, “Why?”</p><p>“I believe you owe me a post.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> owe me so much, Harkness.”</p><p>“Call me that again and I’ll never give you what you <em>think</em> you’re owed.”</p><p>Alice looked between them two of them, a little dumbfounded that she’d never picked up on the obvious flirting, the sizzling chemistry, the easy intimacy.</p><p>But she fished in Rio’s bronze clutch that was tucked under her arm to produce Rio’s phone.</p><p>“Oh you’re just giving it up?” Rio asked in mock-outrage as she watched Agatha smirk and tap at the phone to make it light up.</p><p>Alice smiled and sipped her champagne as Agatha asked: “Passcode?”</p><p>“Six zeros.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“What? It’s easy to remember.”</p><p>And the phone opened up for Agatha and Rio saw her flick about the mess that was Rio Vidal’s disorganised chaos. She had five pages of apps all scattered in no order whatsoever.</p><p>“This is an insane way to live.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio insisted as she snatched her phone away and scanned about a bit to find Instagram which she opened and then handed it back over to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha said nothing as she began to type using only her left hand and Rio watched her with narrowed eyes. “You don’t even have a picture to use yet.”</p><p>“I’ll get one later.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and moved closer to try and see what Agatha was typing but she pulled back and held the phone at an angle where Rio couldn’t see the screen.</p><p>Agatha’s right hand holding her champagne moved to hold Rio back, her knuckles pressing in against Rio’s exposed abdomen and Rio had no choice but to stay still if she wanted to keep Agatha’s hand against her skin. And she wanted it. Desperately.</p><p>She tried to act cool about it, sipping her champagne and looking everywhere but at Agatha, but she felt the soft, minuscule movement of one of Agatha’s knuckles against her skin and could think of nothing else even as Alice started yapping about Rio speaking with some director or other who was standing not too far away.</p><p>Her phone was soon pressed back to her and Rio could snap out of her daze as Agatha pulled her hand away from her to sip at her champagne.</p><p>“I think you’ll like it.”</p><p>Rio huffed as Alice leant in and they read the draft post together: <em>This woman is a walking masterclass. Every scene, every moment, she’s pure electricity. We’re all just lucky to be able to witness it, let alone stand close.</em></p><p>Rio finished it faster than Alice did and she looked up at Agatha who seemed to purposefully be looking around the room as if she hadn’t just written the most obnoxious paragraph Rio had ever read.</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Oh? Then no dance for you.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha and began to grin when Alice chimed in: “Definitely not.”</p><p>“Outnumbered,” Rio said as she sipped her champagne.</p><p>Agatha shrugged and grinned as their little group was infiltrated by some of Rio’s cast mates and Rio focused in on them rather than the smug woman beside her. After greeting everyone properly she settled back and wrapped her arm around Agatha’s back, resting her hand on her opposite hip.</p><p>To her surprise and delight, Agatha relaxed into the hold, leaning into it as she continued to make smalltalk with Rio’s costars who looked positively dazzled that she was deigning to shine her light on them.</p><p>There was something intoxicating about being able to hold Agatha like this, in a way that could be casual, but to Rio was anything but. She felt possessive over her, desperate for people to know she was taken - not by her husband, but by <em>her</em>.</p><p>But conversations at these things were never long, and Rio was begged to be introduced to someone across the room, so she had to relinquish her hold on Agatha, and barely had a chance to say goodbye as she was carted off to a director in the corner.</p><p>Alice followed her and soon Rio was selling herself to this auteur like her life depended on it. She’d auditioned for the man before, but he’d never hired her. Hadn’t even brought her in for a callback, and so Rio was surprised to find him suddenly hanging off her every word.</p><p>And even more surprised when mention of his next project was made and a gentle hint that he’d like - no, <em>expect</em> - to see her for a reading. Alice had almost collapsed beside her when he’d left them to do the rounds.</p><p>“I fucking <em>told</em> you. This is our time. This is our shot, Rio. We’ve <em>got</em> this.”</p><p>Rio could only grin, could only try to hide it behind her champagne glass because no sooner had the director left them than they’d been cornered by two producers. And Rio was back on her best behaviour, selling herself by being as charming as she possibly could.</p><p>It was a cattle market, really. An auction house where only the best and biggest stood a chance.</p><p>Those with reputations, with shelves full of glittering awards always demanded an audience. Like Agatha, who stood beside Jen, both surrounded by sycophants and desperate people trying to vie for her attention.</p><p>Then those with growing reputations, with a solid amount of work behind them, with decent to excellent reviews, and a handful of awards or nominations were next in the running - and Rio chief amongst them.</p><p>Rio got Agatha’s dregs. She got the people who’d already spoken to Agatha or the people who were yet too afraid to approach her. But she got people nonetheless.</p><p>By the time the lights changed and the call was made for the show to start and people to find their seats, Rio was already exhausted. Small talk wasn’t always easy when you were in too-high heels, and had said “oh yeah, the weather in London was as you’d expect!” a million times over.</p><p>Rio was settled between Alice and her director at their cast table and she didn’t get much time to relax as the ceremony began. The only saving grace was that Agatha was visible to her if she just turned her head to the right, risking her neck snapping for the angle she had to be in to see her. But the sight was worth it.</p><p>Agatha was sat not too far away, but too far for Rio’s liking; always too far for her. She looked poised and calm and Rio wondered if she felt that way or she was so good at faking that at this point no one could tell the difference.</p><p>But she must have felt Rio’s eyes on her because she turned to look and the cracks in her appearance showed as she smiled at her. Rio dipped her head a little in acknowledgement and Agatha bit the corner of her lip as she turned away.</p><p>These moments were precious still, because moments were all they had.</p><p>The ceremony started as most ceremonies do, with jokes that landed and jokes that didn’t. Rio smiled and laughed and clapped when it was called on her to do so. She followed the unspoken script of awards shows: look happy, look grateful, be beautiful.</p><p>And with each passing category she thought of Agatha. She thought of the night they could spend together. Of the things she wanted to say to her. Of the things she wanted to <em>do</em> to her.</p><p>Pulled from her increasingly perverted thoughts, Alice touched her side when the presenter stepped out to announce the category for Best Actress. She kept her warm hand there, hidden from view of the cameras as Rio’s face was zoomed in on and her name was read amongst her fellow nominees.</p><p>The ritual of it, the pretence of the piece, it always felt strange that these people were being congratulated for doing so little in the grand scheme of the world. But the world always shrunk in moments like this, always dissolved into the iris of a beautiful woman’s blue eyes.</p><p>“Rio Vidal!”</p><p>Alice reacted. The director reacted. Rio turned.</p><p>Agatha was on her feet, her smile genuine and wide, and Rio lost sight of it as she was rushed at by cast members and crew alike. She barely made it to the stage alive with the amount of hands desperately grabbing her as if she’d provide them with just a slither of the glory she had been blessed with.</p><p>Someone from a nearby table helped her to the stage and she accepted The Actor trophy and turned to her expectant audience.</p><p>“You know,” she began hurriedly, trying to capture the very edges of thoughts as they flew one by one from her shocked brain. “I was expecting anyone’s name but mine so this is… god, this is genuinely… it’s shocking is what it is.”</p><p>There was a smattering of laughter and Rio smiled a little, unsure where to look but knowing the one place she wanted to.</p><p>“Acting is the only thing that ever really made sense to me as a career path… and I’m so, just unbelievably, honoured that I’m able to do it. The fact that I’m able to do it surrounded by the incredible women in this category…”</p><p>She looked then, making eyes at Sylvia, at Jessica, at Shuri (an actress who’d been nominated for her work in a small indie that had grown in popularity at the smaller festivals), and finally at Agatha, where her eyes settled.</p><p>“It’s incredible to me that I’m able to do what I do alongside you.”</p><p>“To SAG, to my ridiculously talented and supportive cast and crew, to my Alice who persuaded me into trying this out in the first place, to my incredible mom and dad, I’m so endlessly grateful.”</p><p>She looked away and cleared her throat softly, “It’s almost a cliché to say now but women’s stories are important. The stories of marginalised people are important.”</p><p>The room cheered and Rio swallowed as she continued, “And as an openly queer, proud Latina, I know how necessary representation is.”</p><p>More cheers. A wolf whistle. Rio smiled a little.</p><p>“So lets keep our minds on the kids at home who need someone to look up to, who need to see themselves represented in order for their dreams to grow. Thank you.”</p><p>She turned from the stage as the applause kicked up again and she grinned her way backstage only to be greeted by Alice who pulled her so violently against her that Rio actually shrieked in surprise.</p><p>“Jesus, Alice!”</p><p>“You’ve got that Oscar on lock. You’re a freakin’ movie star, baby!”</p><p>Rio could only laugh, could only vibrate with delight as she was sped through the interviews that now seemed so redundant because the post-awards questions were the same and Rio’s answers were the same and the only thing different was the outfit she wore.</p><p>But Alice kept her on a tight leash, had clearly taken a leaf out of Jen’s book during this round of interviews, and was pulling Rio from the little makeshift stage in the press room to get her out.</p><p>Rio could only imagine that holding a SAG meant she’d been given the key to a different level of fame and notoriety. But she didn’t complain, she instead went back out to her table, slipped in during a change over of presenters, and placed her award by her champagne as she settled back in.</p><p>Her little movie that could won three awards that night, including Rio’s own. With Best Actress, Best Cast in a Motion Picture, and Male Actor in a Supporting Role, the table was on a high, made only higher by the free champagne and limited food.</p><p>The show was over, but the party had just begun. And Rio was swept up in it, her arms never not full of people coming to congratulate and hug her. But they didn’t feel full enough until Agatha had snuck around, had pulled her in without Rio much noticing until she was already in her arms.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her tightly and then leant back to see her, her smile as warm and wide as ever, her eyes containing Rio’s whole world.</p><p>“Jen is so mad at me.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes, resisting the urge to pull Agatha in to beg her to speak closer to her lips, “Can’t she ever give me credit for achieving something <em>myself</em>.”</p><p>“Absolutely not, Vidal.” Jen’s voice was loud and clear as she stepped in and slipped her arm coolly between the two bodies pressed together at the hips to replace Agatha against Rio - though not as close, not as welcome.</p><p>“She got you that damn trophy and you know it.”</p><p>Rio sighed as she hugged Jen properly and grinned over her shoulder at Agatha who was watching the two with a tender sort of gaze.</p><p>“I am also very talented and charming, Kale.”</p><p>Jennifer pulled away but didn’t hold her the way Agatha just had and instead dropped her hands to Rio’s arms and stepped back a foot, “If you get that goddamn Oscar I’m going to-…”</p><p>“Try to steal it?”</p><p>“Crucify you.”</p><p>Rio laughed and found herself being pulled back by Alice who had stepped in similarly to how Jen had earlier but this time to steal Jen rather than Rio.</p><p>“She’s just mad because her girlfriend has the better client.”</p><p>“I am here, you know.” Agatha joined the fray then and stepped closer to Rio but didn’t reach for her again.</p><p>Alice turned back around with an amused smile but didn’t push it as Jen leant around her and pointed at the two actresses, “Umm? Go mingle, please. Keep away from each other. The agreement is-…”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said quickly, lowering her voice to an urgent whisper, “Yes, others first. Rio never.”</p><p>“Never?”</p><p>“Later,” Agatha clarified with a quick smile, turning to rest her hand against Rio’s exposed abs and press a kiss to her cheek, “Come find me?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, briefly meeting Agatha’s gaze with a smile before Agatha stepped away and Rio felt the loss of her warmth instantly. Now they were open with Alice and Jen it meant they were being watched constantly. They’d created prison guards for themselves, and the guard always expected them to attempt an escape.</p><p>It meant where Rio could have feasibly been beside Agatha all evening with little suspicion, she now had to make a conscious effort to be apart from her.</p><p>Jen stepped around her and left her alone with Alice again.</p><p>But, as usual, they weren’t alone for long.</p><p>Hollywood as a concept was much more complicated than the reality of it. A small town with one business interest was all it really was. Hollywood was the Stratford-Upon-Avon of California, or the Las Vegas of acting.</p><p>It was where dreams came to be and where dreams came to die.</p><p>And in the centre of it all, standing proudly with her statue and her award-winning smile, was Rio Vidal. She was on the precipice of greatness, and had her heart’s desire waiting to be with her in private in just a few, short hours time.</p><p>And those hours began to fly past with the help of a thousand faces kissed and only slightly fewer glasses of champagne drank. And Rio didn’t see Agatha again until she felt a presence at her side as she leant around at one of the small tables set up for those unwilling to dance - or as Alice had so eloquently put it for the “boring old fuckers who need to make sitting at a party a personality trait”.</p><p>Rio was, unfortunately, one of those such people for the sake of talking to the very far from boring Lilia Calderu.</p><p>“Ah, and the prodigal daughter is here,” Lilia announced with a grin as she turned her attention from Rio to the very presence she’d just felt settle beside her. “Looking glamorous as always, Agatha.”</p><p>“You too,” Agatha said not unkindly as Rio felt her drape her arm over her chair as Rio dropped her left hand below the table to seek Agatha’s knee. If Lilia noticed anything off about this she didn’t say anything but she did change the subject from where they’d just been discussing days of Hollywood past.</p><p>“It’s striking, isn’t it, the way Rio looks like young Nicholas.”</p><p>Rio’s brows rose halfway up her forehead and she felt Agatha move a little closer to her, her own hand now squeezing at Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“Dark hair, dark eyes,” Agatha said in what Rio took to be an attempt at nonchalance, but the leg that now pressed against her own told her it was anything but.</p><p>“Goofy teeth,” Rio added in an attempt to ease the conversation, grinning widely on purpose at Lilia to show off the little gap between her two front teeth.</p><p>“There are many who believe,” Lilia began, ignoring Rio’s smile and Rio felt Agatha draw in a heavy breath behind her, her left arm moving a little closer along the table under the pretence of toying with Rio’s half-empty champagne glass, “that children’s faces can tell us a lot about the parents.”</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha drawled, her emerald ring catching the light where she held the stem of the glass, “It’s called genetics.”</p><p>Rio scoffed a laugh and regretted it when Lilia shot her a look.</p><p>“Actually, a lot of cultures have very real and very ancient beliefs about the faces our children inherit.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly and squeezed Agatha’s knee, “I’m not sure there’s anything <em>culturally</em> significant about Nicky’s face, Lilia. He’s a little white boy after all.” She shot Agatha a look and muttered, “No offence.”</p><p>“None taken.”</p><p>“I mean to say,” Lilia bristled a little, not used to being interrupted quite so much, “that some cultures believe children’s faces are the result of a great love passed down from mother to child.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand stopped its movements against Rio’s glass and Rio’s hand went suddenly still and stiff over Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“That those mother’s pass on that love and the child grows into the image of the love inherited.”</p><p>Neither Agatha nor Rio moved for a few seconds, until Rio forced herself to say: “Well, I suppose Nicky has some of his dad’s-…” but she’d trailed off because it made bile rise up her throat.</p><p>“He does looks like Rio,” Agatha said calmly, so eerily calm that Rio turned to look at her properly for the first time since she’d arrived, “I’ve always thought that. He’s nothing like his father.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look around at her and Rio turned back to Lilia to assess her reaction to this. The grand dame of acting only smiled, her sharp brown eyes remaining fixedly on Agatha, “I didn’t think he would be.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand moved from Rio’s glass to find Rio’s hand under the table and Rio bit on the inside of her cheek as she interlocked their fingers together, resting still on Agatha’s knee.</p><p>“Where is the handsome Ralph?” Lilia asked as Rio began to focus more of the feel of Agatha’s thumb brushing her own than anything else.</p><p>“He’s been working on the east coast. Nicky and I stayed overnight last night at the in a hotel as a treat to end off our vacation but Ralph’s back now so he’s with Nicky.”</p><p>“A shame,” Lilia said as her eyes moved to Rio who’d taken it upon herself to drink down the rest of her champagne. “I always so enjoy speaking to him.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know whether Lilia were being sarcastic or not but ever hopeful she said: “Me too. Love that guy.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand and Rio smirked as she met Lilia’s gaze and found the old woman smiling at her, “well, I should leave the two of you alone.”</p><p>She made to stand and paused as she did so, “You two really are a formidable pair.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and she felt Agatha’s hand leave her own, slide up her forearm and squeeze at her bicep. The touch was brief, tender, and made Rio shiver slightly as Agatha held her arm and whispered close to her ear, “Formidable.”</p><p>Rio fought her grin from overspilling into a laugh and turned to Agatha as Lilia left them alone, knowing it wouldn’t last for long.</p><p>“Also,” Agatha said before Rio could say anything, “Since when do you <em>love</em> talking to Ralph.”</p><p>“Since every time I do I prove to myself that I am better than him in every feasible way.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but grinned all the same, shifting away a little in her seat.</p><p>“His useless genes couldn’t even outdo my-…”</p><p>“Don’t even finish that sentence,” Agatha chided with narrowed eyes that Rio took as a challenge so with a grin she said: “Big dick energy.”</p><p>“What does <em>that</em> even mean?”</p><p>“Oh you’re so old.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and Rio grinned, squeezing Agatha’s knee below the table. “But more importantly: this ring?”</p><p>“What about it?” Agatha’s eyes sparkled as much as the jewel on her finger still against Rio’s arm.</p><p>“Green looks good on you,” Rio said enigmatically.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and brushed her thumb across Rio’s skin, squeezing her gently. “Honey, everything looks good on me.”</p><p>Rio felt a hand on her shoulder as she was leaning into Agatha again and she turned to see Alice standing above her, “Come on. You’re dancing with me.”</p><p>“What? Now? No, Alice, we were just-…”</p><p>And Alice leant down to speak directly in Rio’s ear, “Flirting. You’re flirting. But if you come dance with me, Jen will dance with Agatha, and we’ll pass you both off. Just don’t push it, okay?”</p><p>And Rio nodded like a child promised an ice cream if they ate their greens first. She stood up and took Alice’s hand, glancing back to see Agatha follow Jen in a slightly more dignified fashion. But Rio didn’t care. She was soon on the dance floor with Alice in her arms and the protection of Hollywood’s elite and their hangers on around her.</p><p>Limbs and bodies were thrown about and it wasn’t clear who or what belonged to who other than a hand that soon found its was to her stomach and pressed in as a body pressed behind her. Alice shot her a warning look but pulled away as Jen rounded them from the side.</p><p>And Rio’s hips moved in time with the beat, in time with Agatha’s, her hand falling down and back to clutch the hand that rested on her thigh. It lasted all of ten seconds. Ten seconds of bliss, of Agatha pressed so tightly against her, of her hand against her skin, of her fingers curled around her own. But she was pulled in only a way anyone is really allowed to be pulled on a dance floor and Agatha’s hold broke. She spun around and reached for Agatha again as she was pulled into a nearby group of people with familiar faces but uknown names.</p><p>And Agatha moved to her. She took her outstretched hand and arrived by her side again. But she was no longer as close, she was no longer pressed against Rio, and instead simply held her hand through the next five songs, dancing more stiffly than she had been when she was against Rio, but dancing all the same.</p><p>But five songs was all Rio could withstand until she’d had more than enough and Agatha’s hand in her own <em>wasn’t</em> enough any more.</p><p>She leant into her and over the noise of the song and the shouts of the crowd she said: “I want to take you home.”</p><p>Agatha had apparently been waiting for this because without saying anything she dropped Rio’s hand and pushed her way from the floor. Rio was a little less cavalier about leaving and gave everyone close by a quick hug before she went to grab Alice and pulled her with her from the dance floor too - much to Jen’s annoyance.</p><p>It was as they cleared the floor that Alice tugged Rio back a little and said: “Rio, where the fuck is your award?”</p><p>Rio stopped in her tracks and turned to Alice with wide eyes, knowing only that she’d last seen it before speaking to Lilia and <em>after</em> leaving their table at the ceremony.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“Girl, you’re in so much trouble if you’ve lost that damn thing,” Jen said in a tone that if Rio hadn’t been so panicked she’d have been irritated by.</p><p>Rio huffed and stole her hand away from Alice to rub the back of her neck just as a hand found the small of her back and she turned to see Agatha smiling at her with her award in hand. “I assume you were worried you’d lost this.”</p><p>“I could kiss you,” Rio said with a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Please don’t,” both Jen and Alice said flatly.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but took the trophy from Agatha and leant in anyway to kiss her cheek. “I’ll reward you for that later.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes sparkled as Rio pulled back but she didn’t have a second to enjoy it as Alice began ushering her along to the exit. “You’re riding with me.”</p><p>“Are you joking? I can’t go with-?”</p><p>“No. Me. And you’ll be grateful. I’ve also booked a room under your name at the-…”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>,” Rio insisted with a frown, scowling her way out of the party and into the cool Los Angeles night. “That’s a bit overboard, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Look,” and suddenly Alice looked serious so Rio clamped her mouth shut, “We’ll talk about it more in the car but…” she glanced over as Jen and Agatha appeared nearby, all now waiting by the valet for their cars. “What you’re doing,” her voice was lower than before, now they were out in the open, “Jen and I would rather be overly cautious than-…”</p><p>But Agatha stepped in, and Rio caught the frown on her face, “You’re employees. ‘Manager’ is a vanity title. Not a right.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned quietly, placing a hand on her arm as the first car pulled up, “They’re helping.”</p><p>“They’re treating us like-…”</p><p>But she trailed off and she didn’t need to continue for Rio to know where she was going. It was one thing to be sneaking around just the two of them, but with Alice and Jen actively telling them what they were doing was wrong, the little secret began to feel dirty again, and not in a good way.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Jen insisted, taking Agatha’s other arm and leading her to the car.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly as she caught Agatha’s eye before she stepped into the SUV and she turned back to Alice. She opened her mouth to speak but Alice shook her head a little, “Wait.”</p><p>And Rio did. She said nothing until they were back in the safety of the quiet car with their familiar driver.</p><p>“She’s annoyed because it feels-…”</p><p>“Wrong? Like you shouldn’t be doing it? Like it could go completely, cataclysmically wrong?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but nodded, “Yes.”</p><p>“It’s only because it can go <em>wrong</em> for her. You’ll get a little heat, no doubt, but she’s the one with the kid, she’s the one with the marriage, she’s the one with the wholesome image.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip and turned to look out the window, “She could destroy you, Rio. But not before she’s destroyed first.”</p><p>“Mutual destruction,” Rio muttered bleakly, “how romantic.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Alice said softly, “We’re just trying to help. Seeing as you’re both too stubborn to call this off.”</p><p>“Has Jen asked Agatha to call it off?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, her grip tightening on the statue of a naked man she held in her lap. She turned to Alice and paused before she asked: “And she said no?”</p><p>“Actually she said a few other things that meant no, but yes, she said no.”</p><p>“What other things, Alice?”</p><p>Alice turned more in her seat to look at Rio and raised her brows, “Like she’d rather fire Jen than call it off and that she’d happily represent herself and that she-…”</p><p>“She didn’t mean those things,” Rio said quietly, frowning a little across at her manager, “she just gets-…”</p><p>“I know how she gets. And Jen does too. That’s why she’s still working for her. That and she loves her. Says she’s happy.”</p><p>Rio hesitated before she asked the question she’d been holding in since she got back from London, “Does she think she’ll leave him?”</p><p>“She thinks she already is.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio’s heart near exploded in her chest, her blood became crystallised, her body as fragile as porcelain.</p><p>“She thinks she’s already setting things in motion to leave Ralph. But she won’t talk to her about it. Jen can’t get her to tell her anything at all.”</p><p>“Then… then why does she think that?”</p><p>“Hasn’t she told you she’ll leave him? Rio, not even the cliché: ‘of course I’ll leave my husband for you’?”</p><p>“She’s not like that.”</p><p>“Then you need to speak to her. Because Jen’s convinced it’s already happening. And if she loves you even the tiniest amount that you love her then… she has a kid, Rio. Would you take that on? You need to talk to her, for your own sanity and so you can prepare yourself.”</p><p>Rio sighed and looked away again, resting her head back in her seat as the lights of Los Angeles flew by and her heart remained where it always was: somewhere between hope and misery.</p><p>Before they arrived at the hotel Alice made them wait a while around the corner so that Agatha had enough time to head to her room without Rio appearing at the same time.</p><p>It took half an hour before Rio convinced the driver - whom she was paying and <em>not</em> Alice - to drop them off.</p><p>She felt heads turn her way in the bright lights of the SLS lobby but she had one mission and one mission only, to get to Agatha as soon as possible. She checked in with no issue and walked with Alice to the elevator where they were taken to her dummy room for the night.</p><p>Alice opened the door to the suite that Jen and her were to steal and Rio stood impatiently by the door as Alice text Jen their room number and received Agatha’s in return.</p><p>“Presidential suite,” she instructed, “Fifth floor.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and squeezed Alice goodbye, leaving her trophy with her and only at the last minute taking her clutch bag for the sake of having her phone with her.</p><p>By the time she made it to Agatha’s floor and stood outside her suite’s door, she felt strangely nervous. The last time she’d been alone with Agatha she’d been left alone, literally on her knees. The thought made her stomach swirl and she almost made to turn around when the door was wrenched open and Agatha stood before her. Her nerves vanished in an instant.</p><p>“Hey, you.”</p><p>Rio grinned even wider than she had done earlier when trying to break the tension with Lilia.</p><p>And she would have said something, anything, but definitely something cool and smooth, if Agatha hadn’t grabbed her waist and pulled her into the suite before she could.</p><p>“How expensive is this dress?” Agatha asked as she pressed Rio into the now closed door and Rio laughed even as she felt the breath leave her body.</p><p>“If I tell you will you rip it off me?”</p><p>“I’m considering it.”</p><p>Rio hummed a little and rested her hands on Agatha’s shoulders, squeezing them as the brunette before her dropped her gaze to Rio’s chest, her hands tight around her ribs.</p><p>“Is that one of the things you’ve wanted to do to me?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain didn’t seem to be working, or else she didn’t feel the need to respond before she was ducking down already, pressing a kiss to the apex of the diamond cutout of her dress, making Rio’s heart rate pick up again.</p><p>“It’s unbelievable that you’ve been wearing this all night,” Agatha muttered now, her lips brushing Rio’s skin as they moved down the line of her abs to the bottom of the diamond, “and I couldn’t touch you.”</p><p>“Making up for it now though, huh?”</p><p>“Not nearly enough,” Agatha breathed out, nipping gently at her skin before she straightened up again and pressed into Rio, nuzzling into her as Rio smiled and wrapped her arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“You can kiss me,” she whispered softly, watching the way Agatha’s eyes seemed to be fighting closing as her lips brushed her own again and again, not quite pressing in just yet.</p><p>“No,” she whispered back, pulling away until she was an arm’s length from her, “Not yet.”</p><p>Rio frowned and tried to step closer but Agatha held her firmly, “Agatha. What are you-…?”</p><p>“Will you get on the bed?”</p><p>She dropped her hold of Rio and stepped away, but Rio stepped closer and this time Agatha didn’t stop her in time. Just as she was leaning in to press their lips together Agatha’s hand found her jaw and she held her firmly, making Rio groan in frustration.</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>Agatha looked nervous, suddenly unsure, and so Rio nodded and stepped back, frowning to herself only when Agatha couldn’t see her anymore.</p><p>She moved through to the bedroom off to the right, assuming it was the right one because Agatha hadn’t corrected her. And when she sat down on the edge of the bed she realised she was alone. She pushed herself up on the bed and removed her uncomfortable shoes before she settled back against the headboard.</p><p>Agatha was gone for almost ten minutes.</p><p>And ten minutes was a long time when the thing you were waiting for was sex with Agatha Harkness. Or just a kiss from her. Rio would have settled for just a kiss.</p><p>But her patience was rewarded because just as she was about to huff for the fiftieth time since settling on the bed a vision in green lace walked into the room.</p><p>Rio sat bolt upright and stared very uncoolly at Agatha Harkness at the foot of the bed in a sheer lace set and a matching garter belt attached to sheer stockings.</p><p>Against her pale skin intricate lace looked as if it had simply appeared, woven into the shape of her, framing her body as if to show it off in all its glory. Agatha looked like she belonged to another earth, one where she ruled over all, and nature itself was at her mercy.</p><p>But she was on this earth and <em>Rio</em> was at her mercy.</p><p>Rio’s hungry eyes travelled up and down the length of her and settled finally between her thighs. And unless Rio was very much mistaken, the panties were… <em>holy shit</em> they were crotchless.</p><p>“Dios mío,” she breathed out, unable to stop staring and feeling like one of those cartoon dogs with their tongue hanging out.</p><p>“An apology,” Agatha uttered, and as Rio raised her gaze to look up at her for the first time since she’d walked into the room she saw that she looked a little flushed, “For London.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and held her hand out to Agatha, sitting now to swing her legs beneath her and using the slit in her dress to allow her to kneel up properly. “Come here.”</p><p>Agatha slowly climbed onto the bed and Rio found her eyes hungrily tracing every inch of her again, not quite believing what she was seeing. It was only when Agatha was kneeling before her and had taken her hand that Rio looked back up again.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>Rio blinked as her free hand moved to brush over Agatha’s hip, her fingers tracing the lines of the lace, “Am I forgiven?”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio uttered as Agatha’s hand moved up to caress her cheek and her eyes fluttered closed at the soft touch, “I…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha said in such a soft timbre that Rio opened her eyes again to catch the moment, “I can work for it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t have a chance to respond because Agatha’s lips were suddenly on hers and she was kissing her slowly, deeply, as if she wanted to luxuriate in it, to slow down time with each caress of her tongue against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio moaned into Agatha, her hands sliding over delicate lace to grab at her ass, making Agatha moan too. And then, Agatha was pulling away, panting quietly, and Rio whined as she did, leaning closer to try and capture her lips again.</p><p>“Lay down, Rio,” Agatha smiled into a soft kiss, capturing Rio’s lower lip between her own.</p><p>“No,” Rio huffed quietly, kissing Agatha again and again and squeezing Agatha’s ass firmly, “I’m not done appreciating you.”</p><p>“But if you don’t lie down,” Agatha pulled away, pressing her hands into Rio’s abdomen to keep her back, “then I can’t go down on you and I’d really, <em>really</em> like to do that.”</p><p>Rio groaned a little, her gaze dropping to the sheer lace balcony bra that left nothing to the imagination but set everything on fire between Rio’s thighs and she ducked her head, forcing Agatha’s hold to drop as she kissed at the mound of her right breast, squeezing her other in her hand.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped, snatching herself back and glaring at Rio with dark but stern eyes where Rio just smiled drunkenly, her lips parted and wanting.</p><p>“Down. <em>Now</em>.”</p><p>Rio did as she was told, but slowly, petulantly, sitting back on her ass and maintaining eye contact as she slowly lowered herself back and stretched her legs out either side of Agatha as she remained on her knees.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t waste any more time.</p><p>She settled properly between Rio’s legs and Rio bit down on her lip at the sight of it.</p><p>Agatha smirked as she shuffled backwards on her knees and and then lowered herself between Rio’s legs. She pushed her knees open a little more, making Rio feel the stretch until her hands became soft as they trailed up her inner thighs.</p><p>“Commando?” She asked quietly, her smirk growing as she raised her gaze to look across at Rio, “Really?”</p><p>Rio shrugged hopelessly, “It went better with the dress.”</p><p>Agatha grinned up at her, her eyes dark now, her hold tightening on Rio’s thighs. “I’m not complaining.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she sat up on her elbows to take in the view. It was like the universe was giving her a gift. A gift wrapped in lace, a gift whose breath was warm against her, whose tongue was now against her, running slow and steady through her core.</p><p>Rio’s world span when Agatha moaned against her and she lost focus on the goddess between her thighs, unable to see straight for the feel of Agatha’s tongue against her after so long a time.</p><p>She hadn’t been touched since Boston, and that had been a desperate rush to orgasm to fix what was broken between them. And since then she’d only touched herself to memories of Agatha, using her imagination to pretend her fingers were Agatha’s, the dildo was Agatha’s doing, the vibrator was being controlled by Agatha across the city.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio muttered as Agatha continued her explorations, not doing anything to rush either herself or Rio, simply tasting, savouring, teasing.</p><p>Rio began to groan beneath her, and as she lay down properly and her hands moved to Agatha’s hair, she was rewarded with one, gentle, lap of Agatha’s tongue over her clit. It made Rio gasp and her hands  clutch and she looked down to see dark blue eyes staring up at her.</p><p>“Stop. Teasing,” she insisted through gritted teeth, glaring down at the woman now pulling back slightly, her lips glistening in the light.</p><p>“So demanding,” Agatha said with an arched brow, and to Rio’s horror she began to pull up, pressing a gentle kiss to her hip bone before she moved to brush her lips up her abs, nipping lightly at the underside of her breast and then hovering over Rio properly, grinning down at her as Rio scowled up at her.</p><p>“I told you I had things I wanted to do to you.”</p><p>“Is edging me one of them?”</p><p>“Perhaps.”</p><p>Rio huffed and moved her hands up to brush Agatha’s fallen hair from her face, “Can I request that it not be? Because you’re in lingerie and I’m feeling a little…”</p><p>Agatha moved then, pulling back to kneel just above Rio’s chest and Rio swallowed thickly, her hands grasping at Agatha’s thighs as her gaze took her all in.</p><p>The forest green lace wrapped it’s vine-line tendrils in intricate patterns across Agatha’s milky white skin. The choice of colour was deliberate and divine. It was for <em>Rio</em>. Agatha was <em>Rio’s</em>.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha. You look so fucking good.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers moved up to hook into the delicate waistband of the garter belt and Agatha moved to hold her hands there, “Do you like the colour?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“I had it custom made.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up, briefly pausing at the hold the bra had on Agatha’s pale breasts before she looked up to blue eyes.</p><p>“I wanted to surprise you.”</p><p>She turned Rio’s hands to link their fingers together.</p><p>“Does this mean I can’t rip it off?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio groaned when Agatha shuffled down, lowering herself slowly until she pressed her naked core over Rio’s exposed abdomen. Rio gasped when she felt how wet Agatha was. Her eyes wide and her pupils now fully dilated as Agatha arched a brow at her.</p><p>“Agatha,” she insisted, her eyes bugging out as Agatha moved her hands up to place them over her breasts, “Please. This is torture. Please.”</p><p>Agatha smirked down at her and rocked her hips down and against her abs, making sure Rio knew exactly how wet she was by leaving a trail across her skin and Rio released a groan in frustration but looked down at the movement. “F-fuck.”</p><p>Agatha bit down on the corner of her lip as she stilled her hips and Rio gasped when she pulled up.</p><p>“It’s not fair,” Rio breathed out, looking back to where her hands were now pawing at Agatha’s tits.</p><p>“What isn’t fair, honey?”</p><p>Rio groaned again as her hands slipped slowly down to hold Agatha’s waist, hoping this way she could force her back down, but Agatha was stronger than she looked and remained hovering a couple inches above her.</p><p>“You’re still teasing me and I swear to god I-…”</p><p>And Agatha stopped her in her tracks because she switched positions, lying down over Rio again, still with those two inches of space between them.</p><p>She wrapped her hand around Rio’s jaw and angled her chin up slightly. Her hold was tight, almost painful, and Rio whimpered into it. “Then you are feeling a little of how I’ve been feeling all night seeing you in this dress.”</p><p>Rio groaned as Agatha smiled, “But I’ve missed the taste of you. So I’m going to go down on you until you can’t take it any more. And then I’m going to sit on your face and let you feel what you do to me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted as much as they were able to and Agatha’s gaze flickered down to them, “And then,” she flicked her tongue out to brush over the underside of Rio’s upper lip. “I want you naked. And I want to run my tongue over every inch of you.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, trying to arch up and ineffectively pull Agatha down and into her.</p><p>“And I want to fuck you so all you can think about is me.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s jaw again, her fingers and thumb pressing into the hollows of her cheeks as she did and Rio could only gasp, only move her hands down to Agatha’s ass to let her know she wanted that. She wanted all of it. Now. Desperately.</p><p>And Agatha either understood or was no longer able to wait. So she moved down, her lips already finding every available piece of skin she could get to. She took her time and Rio was breathless by the time she felt her mouth between her thighs again.</p><p>In the beforetimes, in the night on Agatha’s couch, the time Agatha surprised her in her bedroom, in the hotel room in Boston, Agatha had been a little more shy, more timid, and Rio had still found her to be this sexy, irresistible goddess of a woman. And now, now she was arching her ass in the air as she ate her out in custom-made lingerie made just for <em>her</em>. And Rio knew she wouldn’t last long. She knew she’d come so quickly that it would beat even Agatha’s speed. And she also had a sneaking suspicion that she might actually die tonight before Agatha was through with her.</p><p>Agatha was more confident now, more sure with what she was doing, which meant that her teasing had easily transitioned to something far more exacting, as the movements of her tongue were designed to build Rio up as quickly and as aggressively as possible.</p><p>“F-fuck,” Rio gasped, her hands finding their way back to Agatha’s hair again, “fuck, fuck, fuck.”</p><p>Agatha’s right arm rested over Rio’s hip, her fingers splayed across the skin of her abdomen and her left moved down from where it had rested there too and she pressed her pointer and middle finger inside of Rio, just as Rio came with a yell of her name, her back arching off the bed.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio groaned quietly, gasping when the woman between her thighs pressed a third finger inside of her, stretching her without mercy and applying tiny, delicate kitten licks to her swollen clit.</p><p>“Jesus,” she muttered again as she found the strength to lean up - if nothing else, for a better view.</p><p>Agatha looked magnificent, and Rio couldn’t believe she what she was seeing. She kept her back arched so Rio had a view of her ass as her apology for her bad behaviour was repeated over and over again against Rio’s needy clit.</p><p>By the time of Rio’s forth orgasm, Agatha was moaning and writhing on the bed. Rio began to tug her up, shaking and breathless as she was.</p><p>“C’mere, C’mere,” she breathed out, eyes dark and wide as she took in the sight of Agatha’s puffy lips and the sheen of herself smeared across her face. “Fuck, come here.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little but she didn’t acquiesce immediately, her fingers still buried achingly deep inside Rio, her lips finding her stomach and trailing their reward across her abs.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio groaned and whined when Agatha pulled out of her, and blinked hazily up at her as her body came to rest above her.</p><p>“I want to do that again,” Agatha murmured before Rio was able to lean up and capture her lips in a soft kiss.</p><p>She leant down between them and smiled as her curious fingers found damp thighs and Agatha rocked her hips towards her, seeking contact Rio was yet to give her.</p><p>“I believe you promised you’d sit on my face.”</p><p>The gold adorning Rio’s face - admittedly slightly smudged and far from red carpet ready as it had been not an hour ago - made her the perfect throne for her desperate queen. And Agatha took to it, like it was made for her, like she’d missed the comfort and relief of it, like she knew it belonged to her.</p><p>And Rio below her ensured she pledged her fealty with her practised tongue.</p><p>Her arms captured the majesty of Agatha’s thighs and her eyes took in the glory of the woman above her as she gasped and moaned and came against her mouth.</p><p>Rio hadn’t been touched by anyone since Agatha for months, which made her sensitive, responsive, and needy. But Agatha had at least had an orgasm within the last week, she’d at least had some recent release at the hands of Rio. Though you’d never guess it. Agatha was still so sensitive, was reacting as though this was the first time she’d felt Rio against her, and Rio felt her chest expand, her hands clutch, her tongue proud as she made Agatha come over and over again.</p><p>Her moaning was turning to babbling and her shouts were unbidden, unabashed, unbelievable to Rio’s desperate ears.</p><p>Only when Agatha’s thighs began to quake with the intensity of it did she pull away, she lifted up and shifted to look down at Rio properly, marvelling at her ruined throne.</p><p>“Fuck, baby,” she groaned as she moved her hand down to caress Rio’s cheek, gathering the sheen of wet there as she moved her fingers down to Rio’s still open mouth.</p><p>Rio sucked on the offered fingers, her lashes fluttering as Agatha continued to watch her. She withdrew them slowly, pushing the pads of them along Rio’s damp lips and kept eye contact as she placed them into her own mouth, making Rio groan as she began to claw at Agatha again, trying to pull her back to her tongue.</p><p>“I wasn’t done,” she insisted as Agatha smiled around her own fingers, and pulled them out with an exaggerated <em>pop</em>.</p><p>And she pulled away, struggling a little with Rio’s insistent hold until she managed to stand at the edge of the bed, her legs a little more wobbly than usual.</p><p>“Take off your dress. I want to see you.”</p><p>Rio had pushed herself up, shuffling to the edge of the bed to sit with her legs over it, pulling Agatha between them. “In a second,” she promised softly, breathing the words out against the sensitive skin across Agatha’s diaphragm.</p><p>Her hands traced from her thighs, toying briefly with the thin suspenders that hung there, up to her ribs and back again and she leant back to admire the view. “Someone measured you for this?”</p><p>“Mmhm.” Agatha’s hands found Rio’s hair.</p><p>“You specified the style? The colour? The crotchless panties?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she stared up at Agatha, grinning at her as her hands rested against her hips, her fingers dipping below the lace of the garter belt.</p><p>“All for me?”</p><p>“Of course for you.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, pressing another kiss to Agatha’s soft skin, “You can leave me on my knees any day if this is-…”</p><p>But Agatha had bent down, angled herself to capture Rio’s lips and kissed her firmly, her hands cupping her cheeks. “Rio,” she rolled the ‘r’ around her tongue, “Nunca volveré a hacer eso, lo prometo.” <em>I’ll never do that again. I promise.</em></p><p>Rio’s brows rose and her heart clenched as Agatha kissed her again and she wrapped her arms tightly around her waist instead of simply holding her and pulled her until Agatha climbed into her lap.</p><p>The kiss changed when Agatha was on top of her. Rio’s tongue forced Agatha’s lips to part and she moaned softly when Agatha’s met her own. The kiss was slower than everything else they’d done that night. It was somehow tender, somehow like a habit rather than a craving.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were soft in her hair, they brushed through it, her thumbs finding Rio’s cheeks and caressing her as she shifted a little closer. And Rio’s arms flexed around the body she held so close on top of her, making sure Agatha felt her hold and knew it was as vital as it was possessive.</p><p>They kissed until they lost their breath and Rio was the first to pull away.</p><p>“You’re still not naked,” Agatha muttered as she kissed along Rio’s cheek until she could sink her teeth into her earlobe.</p><p>“I’m busy,” Rio countered with a grin and a soft grunt as Agatha bit down a little harder and tugged.</p><p>“I want it off,” Agatha said gruffly, breaking Rio’s hold on her to slide from her lap and tug Rio to her feet.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but sought the help of Agatha to peel down the tiny zipper hidden in the bronze material and soon stepped out of the now ruined custom Versace.</p><p>“Better,” Agatha smirked as Rio presented herself to her with a flourish of her hands. “I haven’t-…” she started and then stopped herself, her fingers curling reverently around Rio’s hips as her deep blue gaze roamed the tanned skin on display for her.</p><p>“I-…” and Rio stepped a little closer, frowning at the sudden hesitance, at the stuttering silence of Agatha before her.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“You know this is only the second time I’ve seen you naked?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and finally pressed her body into Agatha’s, draping her arms around her neck. “Doesn’t seem fair,” she said quietly, frowning where Agatha pressed a soft kiss to the corner of her lips.</p><p>“None of this is fair.”</p><p>Rio nodded a little, careful not to dislodge Agatha’s face as it pressed in against her own. “Agatha,” she kept her voice low, as if raising it above a whisper would frighten Agatha off, “Tell me. Why are you suffering in your marriage when you could-…?”</p><p>“See you naked more than twice every six months?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, feeling a relief she didn’t know she’d been seeking with Agatha’s gentle response, “Exactly.”</p><p>“Will you lie down?”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded a little as Agatha kissed her again, and when she pulled away Rio moved back, sliding slowly up the bed to lie down so Agatha could climb back on top of her. She settled her body against Rio’s and the soft weight of her calmed even Rio’s racing heart.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighed out, leaning on one forearm as she trailed her hand down from Rio’s cheek to her throat, and Rio fought the shiver that this gentle touch produced. “Lay still,” she instructed with a small smile, and before Rio could protest, she’d moved again, her hands firm where her lips were soft.</p><p>She kissed over Rio’s jaw, trailing the tip of her tongue down the column of her throat. She kissed over her collarbone, tasted the skin in the valley between her breasts, and groped her possessively as she tasted her. Rio groaned and gasped below her, grabbing and grasping at Agatha’s skin as Agatha continued her explorations.</p><p>Agatha ignored her tits, groping them only, her lips and tongue too busy moving down her abdomen, and pausing briefly to nip at the skin above her belly button. Rio felt the ache between her thighs grow the closer Agatha got but she was left with no relief as Agatha continued along her hip, down her right thigh, kissing all the way to her knee.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio huffed softly, leaning up to look down at her, “Please just-…”</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>Agatha moved slowly back up, pressing an open mouthed kiss to Rio’s inner thigh before she turned her head and opened her mouth fully against her pussy, licking a thick strip through her and moaning as Rio did.</p><p>Rio’s elbows were knocked out from beneath her, unable to bear the weight of her desire anymore, but Agatha had not finished her mapping of her body. She moved back up, her lips warm and wet as they trailed along Rio’s hip, over her ribs, finally latching on to her breast and making Rio groan for it.</p><p>She looked down and whined at the sight; Agatha’s back had arched again, her ass on display for her as her cheeks went hollow for the pressure she was applying around her nipple, her hand curled around her breast, holding her in place.</p><p>“Jesus, I-…”</p><p>And Agatha released her with a grin, looking up at Rio with her brows raised, “I’ve been thinking…”</p><p>Rio groaned softly and looked down at her, frowning at the devilish delight on Agatha’s face as she moved up her again to hover above her face, “You’re such a fucking tease.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said with a richness to her voice that made Rio shiver in the warm room, “Are hickeys off the table?”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>“It’s just, I didn’t really get to see the last one so-…”</p><p>“You <em>cannot</em> give me a hickey.”</p><p>“Tell me why.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and on the off-chance that Agatha might ignore her she wrapped her arms around her waist and pulled her flush against her, “You know why.”</p><p>“I can handle Alice.”</p><p>“I won’t let you.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes but soon relented and pressed a small kiss to Rio’s lips. “Fine. But know I want to.”</p><p>Rio laughed and sighed heavily as she felt Agatha settle more against her, her face close to her own on the pillow and her nose just nudging her cheek.</p><p>It was Agatha who broke the silence again. “When I’m with you,” she said so softly that Rio thought she could only hear it for the breath against her cheek, but Agatha was now slowly rolling onto her side next to Rio and pulling her over with her, “nothing feels… it just doesn’t feel bad anymore.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, frowning just slightly when Agatha brushed her hand across her front, hesitating before she pressed her fingers back between Rio’s thighs.</p><p>She wasn’t giving her time to think, time to process the magnitude of her words, but Rio kept them held in the back of her brain, hidden only under desire and above forgetting.</p><p>Rio gasped softly, reaching to mimic Agatha’s movements against her and groaning when she pressed two fingers without warning easily into the older woman. Agatha gasped much louder than Rio had, her eyes fluttering closed and her lips parting as she adjusted to Rio’s heavy but slow movements against her.</p><p>Rio leant in to capture Agatha’s lower lip between her teeth and Agatha groaned as her own fingers faltered against Rio, unable to focus as Rio continued to fuck her slowly, brushing her clit with her thumb as she did so.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care, she could still feel Agatha against her, her breath against her lips, how wet and desperate she was for her.</p><p>She built her up in no time at all, and just as she was on the edge she pressed more harshly on her clit, scissoring her two fingers inside of her as she came. It was loud, but her moans were broken, and Rio caught them in her mouth as she jutted against her.</p><p>Agatha was at her most beautiful like this, with no walls up and her defences completely breached. Seeing her like this was second only to seeing her with Nicky, when she was so soft and open.</p><p>And Rio fell in love with her all over again as Agatha closed her eyes and panted quietly against her, pressing herself so tightly into Rio, to seek nothing but the feel of her being close. And Rio pulled her hand slowly from between them, and wrapped her arms around Agatha once more, content to just lay like this forever.</p><p>Agatha took longer than usual to come back to herself. But when she did she kissed Rio’s lips, adjusting to return the favour and fuck her just as gently. Rio soon came against Agatha’s learning fingers with the same unbidden energy that Agatha had, and the lips that attached themselves to her neck brought her back down slowly, letting her ride it out until she was trembling.</p><p>“So beautiful,” Agatha whispered against her jaw, pressing a slow kiss there as she pulled out.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio murmured quietly, adjusting to the loss of Agatha with a huff. Agatha smiled against her cheek and then found her lips again, kissing her there softly until she whispered: “Help me take this off?”</p><p>Rio made a small noise from the base of her throat and allowed Agatha to roll her over so she could straddle her hips. She leant up and worked first on the clasp of her bra, snapping it open with one hand so the other could help Agatha pull it from her arms. She captured Agatha’s free right breast against her lips and smiled when Agatha groaned above her, “I didn’t say you could do that.”</p><p>“Mmm’didn’t ask,” she mumbled, kissing the side of her breast before moving to her other but she found her head being pushed back and she scowled up at Agatha.</p><p>“Please,” she uttered helplessly, the heel of Agatha’s palm on her forehead.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows at her and slowly released the pressure holding Rio back, her back arching slightly as she silently gave Rio the permission she sought.</p><p>And Rio wasted no time now, latching onto Agatha’s nipple as if she’d been waiting for it all night. Agatha was just as responsive as before, just as breathy in her moans as Rio worshipped her tits hungrily, careful not to leave any marks but greedy in her veneration of them.</p><p>“Rio, Rio,” Agatha said eventually, just as Rio was moving to pay just as much attention to the neglected breast. “Enough. I-… enough.”</p><p>Rio huffed a breath along Agatha’s breast bone but pulled back and looked up at her with a lop-sided smile, “Your tits are so perfect.”</p><p>Agatha was taken by surprise and laughed as Rio reached around her to unclip the garter belt, letting it pool in her lap as the suspenders slackened and she dropped her gaze to Agatha’s pale thighs.</p><p>“And it’s criminal you can’t wear this on the red carpet.”</p><p>“Oh? You want me to walk the red carpet in lingerie?”</p><p>“Only if you’re walking down it to get to me.”</p><p>Rio looked up again and Agatha’s smile had softened as she brushed her hair from her face, “How can you be so dirty and then so sweet?”</p><p>“Practise,” Rio smirked as she leant into Agatha’s touch. Agatha hummed and slid from Rio’s lap to peel down her stockings, allowing Rio to move behind her and hold her around her waist, kissing along her shoulder sweetly until she pressed into her neck.</p><p>“You’re so warm,” Agatha noted quietly, her stockings now discarded at the end of the bed and one hand across Rio’s arms at her waist, the other reaching up and back to bury in dark hair.</p><p>“Always am,” Rio mumbled against the soft skin below Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“When will you leave tomorrow?”</p><p>“Earlier than I’d like, later than I should.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered quietly, and Rio squeezed her as she heard the tenderness in her voice that reflected the pain in her own chest as the reminder that this was a stolen moment hit her all at once.</p><p>“And then we have a week, right? A whole week of just us?”</p><p>“I’ve booked a house in the Berkeley Hills. It’s private, secluded, and no one will find us or bother us.”</p><p>“Are you going to seduce me or murder me, Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>“Only seduce.”</p><p>Rio hummed, pulling back a little so Agatha could adjust herself against her and she lay back properly against the headboard.</p><p>“I’ve booked it the Tuesday after the Oscars for the week. I’ve arranged for there to be plenty of food and wine so we won’t need to leave and Nicky will stay with Jen so-…”</p><p>“Not Ralph?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha stiffened a little in her arms, “He’s working on the east coast.”</p><p>“Does that a lot,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>“Which is a good thing. I might,” Agatha paused and Rio couldn’t see but she bit her lip before continuing, “I might drive home one day just to see Nicky. If… if that’s okay.”</p><p>“Of course it is.”</p><p>“Jen’s just never looked after him for that long and-…”</p><p>“You don’t need to explain,” Rio reassured softly, turning her head to kiss Agatha’s cheek, “Nicky comes first.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed over her arm and Rio dropped her head again to nuzzle against Agatha’s neck. She breathed her in for a second, her light floral scent mixed with the heady scent of sex in the room cleared her mind somewhat and she asked: “What you said earlier… that being with me made everything feel… not bad? What did you mean, Agatha?”</p><p>She felt Agatha suck in a heavy breath, felt her hold on her constrict, and then a soft whisper: “What Lilia said at the table, about Nicky, how did you feel about it?”</p><p>Rio pulled away slightly, understanding this as an answer in itself. “You already told me that you have him because of me.”</p><p>“About his face, Rio. About why he looks like you.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, knowing Agatha was thinking the same as she was: they look the same because of love.</p><p>“I… if someone were to love me, love me,” she paused and felt Agatha shift slowly and she moved with her, both angling so they could meet the other’s gaze. “…Love me that much that they thought there was some mystical force that meant their son looked like me because of it… I’d want to know.”</p><p>Across from her, Agatha’s lips parted slightly, her eyes somehow becoming more blue the longer she looked into Rio’s darker ones. There was a soft flush across her cheeks and a pink button on the end of her nose. She looked frightened and calm all at once and Rio could have stared at her forever.</p><p>“I don’t deserve you,” Agatha whispered after an age of Rio watching the blue of her eyes.</p><p>“I’ll tell you what I deserve,” Rio whispered right back, leaning in to capture Agatha’s parted lips between her own. There was hesitation to the kiss before Agatha returned it and Rio closed her eyes as she moved her hand up to hold Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she murmured as she pulled away, hearing Agatha’s breathing hitch with her words, “When we have our week, our week of just us, will you talk to me? Properly? About everything that scares you, about everything… please. I want to know. You can’t scare me away.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, a hurried sort of nod, one that told Rio she was agreeing before her mind could catchup and convince her not to. And so Rio kissed her again, holding her a little closer for a few seconds before she pulled away and settled back down.</p><p>She held Agatha a little tighter against her and Agatha moved to slip down in her arms, to turn her head so the edges of her lips could brush Rio’s skin, her profile resting against her chest. They fell into a comfortable silence then, Agatha tapping out a soft rhythm across Rio’s arm as she settled back more. Soon, they moved through to the bathroom together to wash their faces and clean their teeth.</p><p>In the mirror Rio caught Agatha watching her, her expression soft, her eyes appreciative rather than lecherous. And she smiled around her toothbrush as she watched her too.</p><p>The bed was warm and large but they curled up together on one side, sharing a pillow so they could be pressed as close as possible. Rio ducked down slightly as Agatha gathered her in her arms and she pressed gentle kisses to the base of her throat as she settled in.</p><p>It all felt so easy, so perfectly normal to be so intimate with Agatha in ways that didn’t involve shouted moans or gasped praises. It felt like she’d been out in the cold all her life and someone, finally, was welcoming her home.</p><p>Only a couple hours later, Rio woke groggily, groaning quietly as she pulled back from the human radiator pressed against her.</p><p>She rolled away, seeking the cool, unslept in, other side of the bed. She stretched her aching limbs out and reached below the pillow to cradle her head where she could luxuriate in the chill of the soft fabric.</p><p>Her arm reached and her fingers splayed below the pillow and she felt them brush fabric unlike the sheets she’d been tangled in all night. It felt thinner, somehow familiar. She twisted it in her fingers and she tugged it out, expecting Agatha’s discarded pyjamas but finding it wasn’t that at all.</p><p>She held up the worn-thin fabric and blinked into the dim; fighting against her sleep-induced haze and the limited light in the room.</p><p>A strange shape.</p><p>A horse.</p><p>A cowboy.</p><p>Her shirt.</p><p>Agatha had <em>her shirt</em>.</p><p>Rio blinked some more, unsure whether she was still asleep. But as she slowly woke up, she realised the truth of it: that Agatha had stolen her shirt.</p><p>And if Agatha had her shirt here with her in a hotel room when she hadn’t yet been home from her European vacation then that meant she slept with it. She slept with it so regularly she <em>traveled</em> with it.</p><p>For weeks she’d searched for this shirt. She’d contacted local laundries and turned her home upside down in her quest to find it. And now, here it was, folded neatly in her hands as if Agatha treasured it the way she did.</p><p>The shirt had lost her scent, but had the memory of her etched into every thread, as loved and as well-worn as it was.</p><p>And as Rio brushed her fingers over the frayed collar, she knew it meant that Agatha <em>did</em> love her. Perhaps not in the loud, easy way Rio craved. But in a quiet, desperate way that left pieces of her hidden in the dark.</p><p>Her fingers curled in the fabric. She could feel her heavy pulse in her neck, feel with the weight of words still unsaid.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio flinched at the sound of her name in the still room and carefully returned her shirt back under the pillow as she turned to Agatha, protecting her secret.</p><p>Agatha was half asleep still, her eyes barely open.</p><p>“Come back here.”</p><p>Rio smiled. She bit the corner of her lip but didn’t move, enjoying the way Agatha reached for her.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha huffed as she turned her back on Rio, taking the hesitation as a ‘no’.</p><p>But Rio moved quickly then, foregoing her comfort to be close to Agatha once more. To wrap herself around the thief like she’d never left.</p><p>“Agatha,” she mumbled against the warm skin at the base of her neck.</p><p>Agatha just grumbled an inaudible response and Rio grinned against her. “I’m here.”</p><p>Only then did Agatha give in and turn over. She threw her arm up so Rio could curl into her side and press into her neck and was rewarded by arms that gathered their heat around her so snugly she felt like she might suffocate. And what a glorious death that would be.</p>

<p>Rio woke again, not two hours after she’d woken to discover Agatha’s stolen secret. The knowledge sat heavily in her brain as she fought against herself to wake into the soft morning light. It trickled down her throat and settled somewhere in her chest, warming her slowly in the already warm room.</p><p>As she moved to stretch out her limbs she felt another movement against her, a soft body that rolled as she did, a gentle presence that curled with her and a precious face that pressed into her shoulder.</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha mumbled against her skin.</p><p>“Buen día, mi amor,” Rio breathed out before she groaned and stretched her free arm out beside her into the cool of the untouched sheets on the other side of the bed.</p><p>“Did you sleep okay?” Agatha asked after a few seconds of silence, her blue eyes slowly blinking awake to watch the sun creep up the white sheets and tickle the tips of Rio’s fingers.</p><p>Rio hummed before responding, Agatha’s warm hand travelling across her stomach until it curled around her hip, “Better than I have in weeks. How about you?”</p><p>Agatha smiled into Rio’s shoulder and placed a soft kiss there before she said, “I slept fine.”</p><p>“Just fine?”</p><p>“Incredibly?”</p><p>“Better,” Rio grinned as she turned her body into Agatha again, wrapping an arm across her and now cradling Agatha’s head on her arm. She drew a soft pattern over her back and pressed a kiss into her hair before uttering, “I should shower and go.”</p><p>“Just stay a few more minutes,” Agatha said quietly, looking up at Rio with a soft smile, her eyes hooded with sleep still, “don’t make me get up.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and nodded, and settled back onto her back so Agatha could shuffle closer again, this time pressing her face into her neck.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and began to toy with the ends of Agatha’s long hair, her body aching and heavy in the warm sheets of the large bed, her mind clean of worries, and her heart full.</p><p>A morning like this was something that only happened in movies, really. A beautiful woman curled into you, who wanted to spend more time with you, who wanted to press against you and luxuriate in the early morning peace with you. But Rio was a bonafide movie star now, so maybe this sort of thing just came with the territory.</p><p>A soft morning with the woman she loved, her warmth reassuring and gentle by her side, her hand curled around her, her face pressing against her throat, people wrote songs about this sort of thing.</p><p>The opening chords to a once favourite Bob Dylan song floated into Rio’s mind as she lay there with Agatha and she began to softly hum the tune, making her way through the first few lines until she gently sang out into the open room: “mama, you’ve been on my mind.”</p><p>She felt Agatha shift against her, pulling away as she continued to hum quietly. A pair of lips found her own and she went silent again as she kissed Agatha back, slowly blinking her eyes back open when the woman above her pulled away, “Dylan?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“You’re worse in the mornings,” Agatha whispered with a soft smile as she peeled away and went to sit up, stretching her arms above her head and giving Rio a glorious view of her pale back, the muscles rippling as they were stretched.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Too cute. It’s very annoying.”</p><p>Rio laughed but remained where she was, adjusting only to lean up on one elbow as she continued to take in the view. “You have a whole week of cuteness to look forward to.”</p><p>Agatha groaned quietly as she rolled her neck out, “I’m not sure I can handle that.” And just as Rio was about to respond Agatha turned to her with a dazzling grin and Rio was rendered speechless.</p><p>She closed her mouth and watched mutely as Agatha span around properly and without any warning pushed her onto her back and crawled over her, resting just over Rio’s hips. Rio swallowed and reached immediately for Agatha’s thighs, grateful that neither of them had bothered to put on any clothes.</p><p>Though Rio wouldn’t have minded if Agatha put on her cowboy shirt. In fact, she was half a mind to reveal she’d discovered it just to see if Agatha would wear it for her.</p><p>“But maybe if every morning,” Agatha continued as if nothing had happened and as if Rio’s thoughts weren’t currently somewhere buried under the unused pillow the other side of the bed. “Maybe if you’re always naked I can handle it.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped again as Agatha’s hands crept slowly over her chest until her fingers buried in her hair and Agatha was leaning over her once more. She didn’t press in but Rio groaned quietly when Agatha’s breasts brushed over her own and she hovered there for a few seconds before she pressed them down into her.</p><p>“God you’re a miracle.”</p><p>Agatha laughed but something in her face softened as she took Rio in and Rio’s strong hold around her waist convinced her to let go and press her whole body weight on her, so she did.</p><p>Rio leant up to nudge their noses together and whispered, “How will you get to Berkeley? I can drive us?”</p><p>“Separate cars is better, I think,” Agatha uttered as her smile faded just a little. “Just in case anyone sees one of us.”</p><p>Rio nodded but swallowed down the hurt as Agatha pressed her lips to the corner of her own.</p><p>“Okay, makes sense.”</p><p>“But then a week of this, okay? No expectations, no hiding.”</p><p>Rio felt something happen to her then. Something hideous. Something mortifying. The sting of unshed tears hit her before she could process it. The ache in the back of her throat came from nowhere, she was unwarned, unprepared.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio watched her brow furrow as she gazed down at her. “Honey.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes then, throwing her arm across them for extra protection until she felt Agatha shift off of her and gentle hands peel her arm away. “Rio, hey,” Rio relented and let Agatha pull her arm away, and lay there blushing and horrified that she’d almost started to cry.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha whispered again, her hands now against Rio’s cheeks, “What is it?”</p><p>“A week isn’t enough,” Rio admitted in a small voice, knowing herself well enough to know what had made her body react before her brain could catch up. “I hate it.”</p><p>She watched Agatha swallow thickly, watched her frown deepen and her blue irises swirl with something she couldn’t read. “I know it’s not enough, honey. I know.”</p><p>Rio felt it in her chest then, the ache of wanting Agatha so badly and the pain of not knowing how to express it. But Agatha was moving, moving away and Rio almost reached for her but had no chance to because Agatha was instead pulling her up so she could hold her properly and Rio wrapped her arms around her immediately, wanting only to be close, luxuriating of the warm weight of Agatha in her lap.</p><p>She’d calmed herself down, enough that she still felt the pain of the tears but still none of them spilled. And Agatha sat on top of her, drawing soft circles on her back, burying her nose into her hair and pressing slow, soft kisses across her cheeks and down her jawline.</p><p>It could have been ten seconds, it could have been forever, but something disturbed them, something loud and brash and unwelcome.</p><p>Someone was knocking at the door.</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and Rio pulled away enough to smile slyly up at her, her eyes still sparkling from their traitorous turn. “I bet you I know who that is.”</p><p>Just as the words left her mouth an obnoxious vibrating kicked up from Agatha’s bedside table and Agatha practically growled as she threw herself away from Rio.</p><p>“I’ll go shower,” Rio said with a smile that grew the more Agatha looked annoyed.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t looking at Rio anymore.</p><p>“What?” She snapped when she answered the phone to whom Rio guessed would be Jen. Rio left her to it as she slipped from the bed, grabbed her bag from the side, and disappeared off to find the bathroom.</p><p>The door to the suite was still being knocked but Rio ignored it as she eventually found the bathroom, deciding opening it up whilst stark naked wouldn’t help Agatha’s mood.</p><p>As the water turned on she heard the sound of muffled voices and she knew she couldn’t be too long or either Jen or Alice might be murdered by the time she was done - maybe both of them. So she washed off the evidence from last night and lathered herself in floral soap before rinsing that away too.</p><p>She stepped from the shower clean and dripping and dried herself quickly before she rummaged in her bag for clean underwear and clothes to wear. Once in her matching black sweater and sweatpants and with freshly brushed teeth she braved whatever was waiting for her beyond the bathroom.</p><p>It was a sight to behold.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the open living space Agatha looked tense, wrapped up in a plush white robe with her arms crossed over her chest. And then there was Jen, in the same position as Agatha, only she was fully dressed, standing just by Alice who sat on the couch, her hand wrapped around the back of Jen’s knee.</p><p>Everyone looked tense. Everyone looked unhappy.</p><p>“We are not children,” Agatha was saying with more than just a hint of venom in her voice.</p><p>“Then fucking stop acting like one!”</p><p>Rio blinked at the response, at the way Jen was throwing her hands in the air, at Alice’s arms that had wrapped around her thighs to pull her down onto the couch with her.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio said without meaning to, alerting Agatha to her presence.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha uttered, “explain to Rio what you just explained to me.”</p><p>And Rio moved around Agatha, touching her arm briefly as she went to curl up in the chair opposite Alice and Jen, Agatha just off to the left now.</p><p>Jen looked pissed, her thumb and forefinger pressing into the bridge of her nose. She took a breath and Rio watched as her hand floated gracefully back down to her lap. “We want you to sit separately at the Oscars Luncheon.”</p><p>There was a pause, a collective inhalation of breath, then: “You okay, Rio?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head at the question, her instincts telling her it wasn’t related to what Jen had just said, although Jen was the one to ask.</p><p>“She’s fine,” Agatha snapped, “We’re talking about <em>this</em> now.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said slowly, frowning a little at her own manager who was yet to say anything. “Why?”</p><p>“Because if we leave you alone for too long then you’ll start flirting and I really don’t want-…”</p><p>But Agatha had thrown her arms up and Rio bit down on her lip at the sight of it. “We are capable of behaving ourselves for the sake of one lunch, <em>Jennifer</em>.”</p><p>“Apparently you’re not capable of keeping it in your fucking pants, Agatha. Or else we wouldn’t be in this mess.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said quickly, moving as Agatha had taken a step forwards. Agatha huffed but let Rio hold her arm and she didn’t move any closer.</p><p>“This is between <em>us</em>. We can control ourselves. Besides,” and Rio moved a little, feeling Agatha turn to her as she stepped just past her, “We aren’t the ones who invited the other on vacation knowing it would be awkward as hell for our <em>clients</em>, <em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>It was a cheap shot maybe, a vicious one even, but as her eyes moved to her friend on the couch she saw that it had landed just right. Alice looked suitably chastised and Rio felt Agatha take hold of her sweater as Jen huffed.</p><p>“That was different. No one cares what we’re doing. The world cares about the two of you.”</p><p>But Rio had got her point across because Alice wouldn’t meet her gaze anymore and Agatha had a relaxed a little - maybe because she now had Rio on side or maybe because Jen wasn’t shouting anymore.</p><p>“Well, we cared when you forced your relationship on our vacation.”</p><p>“If it weren’t for us gatecrashing, <em>Rio Vidal</em>,” Jen started up again and Agatha moved a little closer to Rio’s side, still clutching her sweater. “You wouldn’t be in the pants of the best actress of the twenty first century.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but Agatha had already snapped: “Don’t say it like that. You make it sound so cheap.”</p><p>Jen blanched a little and without looking Rio moved her arm out and easily was able to curl her hand around Agatha’s left wrist.</p><p>“I think we all just need to calm down.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away then and went to sit in the chair Rio had just vacated. When Rio turned she saw that she looked mutinous. “If you change the seating arrangements, I just won’t show.”</p><p>“Oh right,” Jen drawled, “Because being across the city from Rio is <em>much better</em> than being five feet away.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and went to sit on the other free armchair, tapping her fingers idly to shake off the tension there. She dared to look at Agatha and saw that she wasn’t looking at anyone in particular, just staring at the wall, her jaw tight and her blue eyes livid.</p><p>They hadn’t been in public together like this before so Rio didn’t really know how to react to her, what her limits were, if she’d want Rio to squeeze in beside her or stand up and take her hand. But she wanted to move over and kiss her face until it became soft again. She wanted to stride across and tug Agatha’s robe until it fell open for her and she could slip inside and be pressed against her, too warm in her arms once more.</p><p>“Rio.” The sound of Alice’s voice cut through her thoughts and she turned to see her friend staring at her, looking at her with raised brows, “You’ll be beside Wanda.”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said stiffly from somewhere to Rio’s right. “You’ve made the call already?”</p><p>“Afraid so,” Alice said quietly, her dark eyes flickering across to Agatha briefly before they moved back to Rio, who at least looked like she wouldn’t explode.</p><p>“It’s for the best, Agatha,” Jen tried in a placatory tone that Rio just knew would fall on deaf ears. “Besides, it’ll give you enough space that people won’t think-…”</p><p>“In case you hadn’t noticed, nobody thinks <em>anything</em>. We haven’t raised one-…”</p><p>“Actually,” Jen said, a little firmer this time, “the internet is very loud about some of the recent pictures of you. Boston started a trend.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw felt tight suddenly, the fingers that had once been tapping suddenly straightened, her bones calcifying on the armrests.</p><p>“The internet tries to pair me up with every woman I-…”</p><p>But Jen held her hand up to silence Rio and Rio was so shocked that she closed her mouth. Agatha stood and marched over to her manager, holding out her hand, palm up, fingers tight. “Give it.”</p><p>Jen handed it over, and Agatha snatched it away, and to Rio’s surprise she walked over to her, looking at her for a second before she turned and sat on the very corner of the chair. Rio shifted silently across and Agatha moved to take up more space.</p><p>“They’re desperate for it.”</p><p>“Agatha’s married,” Rio said quietly, “it’s just horny internet fantasists. It’s nothing more than that.”</p><p>No one responded to Rio though and she looked over Agatha’s shoulder as she began flicking through the various tweets that had Agatha tagged in them and Rio didn’t get to read much, so fast was Agatha’s thumb swiping through them, but she saw her name appear every two or three posts.</p><p>“It’s not that bad,” Agatha concluded, though if she were telling the truth Rio couldn’t be sure. She settled back more. Pressed into the side of the chair so Agatha could squeeze in properly if she wanted to - but she didn’t push it.</p><p>Agatha was looking up at Jen again, but the white knuckles on the hand clutching her phone told Rio that she perhaps hadn’t been telling the truth, or maybe she was still thinking of Rio’s seat beside Wanda.</p><p>Rio reached for her, placed her hand on her back, felt the muscles tense then relax, and Agatha shifted her weight backwards into the touch as Jen said: “Whatever you say, Agatha. We’re just trying to help.”</p><p>“Sit back,” Rio murmured softly, and Agatha did. She moved back slowly, letting Rio move her arm around her as she settled.</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>“With Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and shook her head, “No. How far?”</p><p>“Two down, across the table.”</p><p>Rio tugged Agatha a little closer into her side and was rewarded with a pale hand that moved to rest on her thigh, but only slightly, only so her pinky and ring finger were touching her and the rest of her hand sat on her own leg.</p><p>“It’s too far, Jen.”</p><p>“It’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers flexed by Rio’s thigh and Rio moved her free hand down to take it, forcing her to relax them. “It’s fine. It’s just a lunch. We can stand together beforehand and after and then we have a whole week.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but Jen was still watching her friend closely. Alice had dropped her eyes to where Rio was holding Agatha’s hand. Rio cleared her throat, “After the Oscars there’ll be less press around, fewer events. I’m filming at Paramount anyway until late summer so we’ll be careful about how we see each other.”</p><p>Jen looked away then and Agatha turned her head to look at Rio, her gaze already softer than it had been before.</p><p>“I can give you a key?” Rio asked quietly, pulling her arm from where it was sandwiched between Agatha’s back and the couch to instead slip around Agatha’s arm to hold her left hand in two of her own.</p><p>“Oh? Have you started locking your door?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha and looked away with a scoff but soon felt a soft kiss to the corner of her jaw. “I’d like that.”</p><p>“I can’t believe we didn’t spot it.” Alice had spoken up again, shaking her head in disbelief. Jen bristled. “Actually I knew something was going on. Rio was far too into her. Even for a fangirl.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but heard a soft noise emitting from Agatha and she knew if she turned then she’d see her smiling so she relaxed a little. “Whatever. When we were in Italy I was just admiring a hot woman.”</p><p>“And fucking another on a beach,” Agatha added and Rio turned to her then, and she smirked a little even as Agatha kept her eyes down on their hands, “Maybe if you’d made a move earlier.”</p><p>“<em>Wait</em>,” Alice said quickly, pointing a finger at Agatha which made the woman beside Rio stiffen and press closer into her, dislodging her shoulder to shift forwards as Agatha pressed behind her.</p><p>“<em>You</em> made the first move?”</p><p>Something had shifted, something Rio could feel in the way Agatha had pressed in behind her right shoulder, her body turning a little more into her own. Jen opposite them was watching Agatha closely and only Alice seemed to not notice the change in the room.</p><p>But Rio guessed what it might be. Agatha controlled the narrative in every room. She gave people permission to ask certain questions, and answered only those. Jen and Rio were one thing, but Alice was another. And Rio realised then that Agatha didn’t know her well enough yet, she only trusted her because Rio did, but apparently that still had its limits.</p><p>“We’re close at the actually ceremony, though.” A change of subject, a squeeze of Agatha’s hand, the feel of her turning away to look out the window.</p><p>“Alice said you’re taking your mom?”</p><p>Jen had picked up the thread and secured it tightly so the conversation could move without fear that Agatha would snip it. “Yeah, my dad too but he’ll have to sit back with Alice.”</p><p>“Agatha will be with Ralph.”</p><p>Rio nodded, having expected nothing less. Agatha beside her uncrossed and recrossed her legs and Rio looked down to them, seeing her pale knee slip through the gap in her robe.</p><p>“You know,” Jen started, slower this time, her dark eyes trained on Rio’s as she looked back up, “we should start thinking about cleaning up your image.”</p><p>Rio looked up, frowning at Jen as Agatha scoffed beside her, “Don’t start, Jen.”</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with her image,” Alice said almost as quickly as Agatha had responded and Rio felt grateful to the both of them but she could fight her own battles.</p><p>“What exactly do I need to clean up?”</p><p>“Well,” Jen started and Agatha shook her head but said nothing, “This party girl sports fan image. You’re getting too old for it and-…”</p><p>“I’m thirty two.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said suddenly, “Drop it.”</p><p>“It’ll be easier for you if Rio appears to be a little more wholesome when you-…”</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em>, Jen.”</p><p>Agatha had pulled her hand away from Rio’s clutches and Rio turned to look at her, seeing the sharpness in her blue eyes as they stared across at Jen. But it didn’t matter that Agatha had interrupted her, Rio had guessed what Jen was trying to say.</p><p>If she wanted to be with Agatha, if Agatha would ever leave Ralph, Jen was trying to tell her to be prepared.</p><p>“I have little cousins,” Rio said suddenly, turning from Agatha to focus on Jennifer. “They’ve papped me before with them. They love me and I love them. There’s been articles about me taking them to the park. I talk about my family on talk shows. I take my mom and dad to games. I attend rallies for causes I care about and I’m a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. But more importantly than all that I’m a good daughter, a good friend, and a good person. I don’t need my image cleaned up. And I don’t need your judgement on me either.”</p><p>Agatha’s arm reached across her as she came to her conclusion and unlike her tentative hold before, she’d stretched her arm fully across Rio, protectively guarding her from the woman across the room.</p><p>“You don’t need to defend yourself,” she said without looking at Rio, her eyes still on Jen. “She doesn’t, Jen.”</p><p>“I’m not saying she’s a <em>bad</em> person.”</p><p>“You’re saying I’m not good enough.”</p><p>Jen huffed and Agatha’s hand clutched at the fabric of her sweats, her knuckles pale with effort.</p><p>“Rio, babe,” Alice said in a faux-calm voice, “You’re fine. Your image is fine. You’re well-liked and-…”</p><p>“I’m just saying you’re not exactly on Agatha’s level.”</p><p>“Jesus, Jennifer!” Agatha exclaimed and Rio instinctively grabbed Agatha’s arm as it sat diagonally across her. “Back off.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and slipped her left hand down the length of Agatha’s arm to curl over her hand. “It’s fine, Agatha. She’s being-…”</p><p>“A bitch,” Agatha concluded.</p><p>“No one will come out of this clean if it ever comes out <em>or</em> you decided to go public.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha stiffen beside her but she didn’t pull away and Rio took in a steadying breath as she said: “We don’t need to worry about that right now. We’re being cautious - overly so. The world sees us as friends, or as being friendly until the season is over. Soon I’ll be back to filming and there won’t be cameras on us every second.”</p><p>“Mention Rio cleaning up her image one more time and I’ll fire you.”</p><p>It was a warning shot. One delivered with impeccable accuracy, but one that had clearly been anticipated.</p><p>“You’ve lost yourself an Oscar because of a crush, Agatha. I’m not sure firing me is in your best interests if you want to keep your career.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t sure if she or Agatha had tensed first but the fact was that both of them had. Alice had moved on the couch to throw her arm over Jen in the same way that Agatha’s arm was over Rio, and she was staring wide-eyed at the two women opposite.</p><p>“You don’t mean that, Jen,” Alice prompted softly as Rio moved her hand over to wrap around Agatha’s thigh, her head turning to look at the woman beside her.</p><p>“Cheap fucking shot, Jen. That all you got?”</p><p>Rio swallowed and shook her head, “Agatha. Leave it.”</p><p>Jen sneered but looked away, “Alice and I are handling this because the two of you-…” she seemed to think better of it and sighed as she tried again, “we know what we’re doing. I just hope you two do too.”</p><p>Rio kept her eyes on Agatha, leaning around her to dislodge her arm and cup her cheek to get her to turn into her, “Hey. Relax. It’s fine. A whole week soon, okay?”</p><p>It took a few seconds but Agatha pulled her arm from Rio and instead took the hand that was on her cheek. She kissed it and dropped it to her lap, toying idly with her fingers.</p><p>Alice was looking away, a faint blush across her cheeks. Jennifer was staring at the floor now, her face set, her brow furrowed.</p><p>And Rio breathed out slowly, and forced a smile, forced herself to not say anything that might start the arguments again and instead settled on: “Can we go back to bed?”</p><p>The curve of Agatha’s lips told her she was taken by surprise and the laugh that followed was soft and for Rio’s ears only. “Please.”</p><p>“Alice and I should leave,” she said once she’d enjoyed Agatha’s smile a little while longer, pretending not to see her blue eyes filling with tears. “We’ll just keep arguing.”</p><p>“I’m not <em>arguing</em>, Rio. I’m <em>telling</em>.” Jen was watching the two again and Rio sighed quietly, beginning to extricate herself from Agatha’s hold.</p><p>“Alice, we should go.”</p><p>As she stood Agatha moved closer to the edge of the chair and Rio turned to her to tilt her face up and kiss her. To her surprise Agatha didn’t pull away. She held onto Rio’s wrists with a firmness that was as welcome as it was unexpected. She kissed her back, pressing another softer peck to her lips when Rio broke it.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’ll call you later.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she pulled away and shot Jen only a cursory glance as she moved back through to grab her bag and collect her things.</p><p>“I’m trying to help!” Jen called out behind her but Rio ignored her and heard Agatha say something back but she didn’t hear exactly what.</p><p>Alice was waiting by the door and Rio managed to smile at her as she opened it for her but just as she was stepping out a hand found her arm and she was turned around, “I just need a second.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but turned to Agatha readily, “What is it?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darted to Alice and then back to Rio and Rio frowned as she turned to motion to Alice to leave them and she pushed back on the door to close it. “Agatha? What-?”</p><p>But a pair of soft lips had silenced Rio and Rio’s words were the last thing on her mind as her fingers curled into the soft flannel of Agatha’s robe at her waist. Agatha broke the kiss after only a second or two and whispered just for Rio’s ears, “That’s how I’d kiss you when you win.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered back with a deep frown, her eyes fluttering open to take in Agatha’s soft smile before her, the blue eyes that looked pained. “I expected a little more tongue.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh ghosted her lips and Rio tried not to shiver as she wrapped her arms around the brunette’s neck, “You’ll be a two-time Oscar winner soon and safe in the knowledge that I always want to kiss you. With or without tongue.”</p><p>Whether real or imagined Agatha’s shoulders dropped an inch and she shrank her body more into Rio. And Rio frowned as she did. She tightened her hold as Agatha murmured, suddenly serious, with more sincerity than a mourner’s prayer: “Rio, I had a really good time last night.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“I mean it.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said calmly, though she felt anything but. “I did too.”</p><p>“It’s not a crush.” The words were rushed out, falling over their own consonants to make themselves heard.</p><p>Rio nodded, swallowing the truth that Agatha couldn’t yet bring herself to admit.</p><p>Alice was stepping back over though and Agatha pulled away before Rio could kiss her again. Rio’s hands lingered for as long as possible on Agatha and she only turned at the very last second to follow her manager out the door.</p><p>They made it to the car in record time, with Alice not keen on dawdling when she knew Agatha em Jen wouldn’t be far behind.</p><p>“Will she leave him?”</p><p>Rio’s head with leaning against the window of the car that had arrived to take them home and her eyes were trained on the road outside as they powered to her little house in the hills.</p><p>“I hope so.”</p><p>“She’s not told you she will?”</p><p>“We didn’t exactly do a lot of talking last night, Alice.”</p><p>“Has she even hinted that-…?”</p><p>Rio sighed and closed her eyes, “Why did Jen ask if I were okay earlier?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio turned to blink at Alice, “At all?”</p><p>“No. I asked her why she called you yesterday and she didn’t give me an answer.”</p><p>Rio turned back to the window and felt Alice reach for her sleeve. “Hey. You look good together. She’s smitten, that’s clear. Jen knows it’s not just a crush.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but softened as she thought back to how Agatha had curled into her the night before, how she harboured the secret of the stolen shirt, how she looked more refreshed that morning than Rio had seen her in a long time despite only getting a handful of hours’ sleep.</p><p>“I’m so in love with her.”</p><p>“I know, babe.”</p><p>“Last night she… she’s frightened. I hope of just losing Nicky. At least… she won’t tell me what else she’s frightened of. But she’s scared and she hides it well but sometimes she just lets go and lets me see it and I don’t know how to fix it.”</p><p>“Jen says they’ve been arguing more.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and turned from Alice again, unsure she wanted to hear this.</p><p>“I can’t believe she’s with him.”</p><p>“It’s strange,” Alice said in a much lighter tone than before, but Rio could hear the strain in her voice, “How natural the two of you look together. She’s this big, megawatt movie star and you’re my best friend and yet you look… you both look like you’re where you want to be when you’re together.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond after that. They made their way back to Rio’s house in silence and Rio disappeared for a run before Alice could broach the topic of her affair again.</p><p>The cool air stung her lungs as she raced through the hills and valleys in the dusty trails of northern Los Angeles. Each heavy step in the Californian soil brought her closer and closer to her decision.</p><p>It wasn’t born of nothing, it wasn’t made from scratch. It had been tumbling round and round in Rio’s brain for weeks now. But the intensity of the exercise, the heart that thrummed in her chest but really remained across the city with another, gave her the courage to stand by her convictions.</p><p>She would make it clear to Agatha that she would be there for her after Ralph. That she would be there for Nicky too if she wanted her to be. That she’d hold her fears as her own and try everything to soften them until they were harmless ghosts of worries past.</p><p>She’d tell her when they were away, in no uncertain terms, that she wanted to be with her, turn this into something that didn’t have to remain hidden, and she’d proudly announce to the world that Rio Vidal belonged with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>It was as she was deciding exactly how she’d tell Agatha - over dinner, in candlelight - she felt her phone vibrate against her hip and the music blasting in her headphones pause.</p><p>“Alice, what is it?” She barked into the open air, her wireless AirPods picking up her voice as she continued her run.</p><p>“Actually it’s me.”</p><p>Rio almost skidded as she stopped suddenly and managed to right herself quickly before she said: “Agatha. Shit. Sorry. I told Alice not to bother me whilst I-…”</p><p>“Are you busy?”</p><p>“I’m just on a run.”</p><p>“I won’t keep you. I just wanted to check you were okay.”</p><p>Rio was panting softly and though she knew she was alone she looked around to make sure she was. “I’m fine. Are you?”</p><p>“Jen is just mad that I’ve kept this from her for so long.”</p><p>“I know, Agatha.”</p><p>“She’s making the wrong call about keeping us apart at the lunch.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha?”</p><p>“I’m sitting next to you at that lunch.”</p><p>Rio laughed and stretched her arm across her chest, “Are you going to bully someone into switching?”</p><p>“No. I’ll just move the place names.”</p><p>“It’s that important to you?”</p><p>“It’s not to you?”</p><p>Rio sighed as she moved to lean back against a nearby tree. “I don’t like it any more than you do. But it’s also not something to worry about. I’m just focusing on our week alone where we can sit where we want and do what we want.”</p><p>“That isn’t the point.”</p><p>“Then what <em>is</em> the point?”</p><p>“The point is,” and Rio began to grin as Agatha’s voice got louder, “That I want to sit next to you.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Stop it.”</p><p>Rio laughed again, “You’re mad because you can’t sit next to me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer for a second and then she said, “Will you wear your necklace?”</p><p>“I was planning on it.”</p><p>“It’s more than a crush.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and slowly lowered herself into the dirt, crouching by the base of the tree. “You said.”</p><p>“I just don’t want you to think it’s just sex or something.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her watch, wondering if she’d soon get a warning about her heart rate being suddenly dangerously high. “I don’t think that.”</p><p>“Good, because it isn’t. And I want to make sure you know that.”</p><p>“Agatha? Is everything okay?”</p><p>Rio’s question went unanswered for a few seconds before Agatha eventually said again: “I just want to make sure you know that.”</p><p>“Okay, I do. I know that.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said in a voice that sounded to Rio like she was finally relaxing.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“We just need to get through the next few days and then we’ll discuss everything when we’re together again, okay?”</p><p>“Not calling it off, though? Not breaking up with me for-…?”</p><p>“Breaking up? I didn’t realise we were in a relationship.”</p><p>There was silence again and Rio began to chew on her lip, worried she’d pushed it too far. She slid down properly onto her ass and stretched her legs out in front of her, watching the red dust float into the air where she’d disturbed it.</p><p>“Are you going to break it off with me?”</p><p>“No. That’s the farthest from what I want.”</p><p>Agatha was silent again and realising she wouldn’t break it Rio did it for her: “What’s going on, Agatha? Jen asked me if I were okay yesterday and you reacted to it before I could even respond to it and now you’re suddenly worried I want to break it off?”</p><p>Rio was met with another wall of silence, another barrier to the internal workings of Agatha’s brain.</p><p>“We have to be able to talk, Agatha. Or this will never work.”</p><p>“Our trip. We’ll talk when we have the time to. When it’s just us.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“It’s not a crush, Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily, her heart sinking under the weight of her own patience. “I know, Agatha.”</p><p>“I’ll let you get back to your run.”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha breathed out quickly before Rio could tap her AirPod to hang up. “I just want to sit beside you.”</p><p>Rio nodded on the deserted trail, watching the wind move the dust by her feet. “I know. I want that too.”</p><p>“Bye, honey.”</p><p>“Bye, Agatha.”</p><p>Two taps and Agatha was gone.</p><p>Rio finished her run but with none of the gusto she’d had before.</p><p>The wind had been taken out of her sails only to be replaced by a slow sense of dread that stayed with her until the next day where she went through the motions of getting ready with her usual glam squad.</p><p>She couldn’t rationalise it. Couldn’t reason it. Agatha was telling her without saying the words that she wanted her, that she was scared Rio would back away, that she wanted to talk when they were together. These were all good things. But something was sparking in her mind like a flint stone aiming for a fire.</p><p>All she could calm herself with was the impending reunion with Agatha, the sight of her again, the feel of her hand in her own.</p><p>Her face and body were moved this way and that as she was made up to be the star everyone wanted her to be. She’d chosen - alongside her stylist - a simple grey plaid suit with cropped pants and a white crop top underneath. It was formal enough and allowed her to wear Agatha’s necklace without angering the man hired to arrange every detail of her look. Alice had simply rolled her eyes when she saw the green jewel sparkling against Rio’s tanned skin.</p><p>But Alice wasn’t invited so wouldn’t be able to roll her eyes at Rio anymore that day. And Rio knew that was partially the reason her and Jen had tried to keep Rio and Agatha apart. They would have no control once the event started. It was closed off, press free apart from the initial red carpet, and supposed to be informal.</p><p>The Oscars Luncheon was an event arranged to get all the nominees together; it was an excuse to mingle, to congratulate each other on their mutual success, and for the Academy to get their annual nominees photo.</p><p>But for Rio Vidal, it was an excuse to see Agatha again.</p><p>“Jesus, Vidal. Give us all a break.” Rio rolled her eyes as Jessica Dyson pressed a kiss to her cheek and squeezed her arm, “You look hot. Who’re you trying to impress?”</p><p>“Jess, if it were at all appropriate I’d be asking you to make out right now.”</p><p>Jessica laughed and Rio twinkled a grin up at her after looking her over appreciatively. A glass of champagne in her system and the familiar butterflies that came with soon seeing Agatha had killed any concerns she’d had in the hours before her arrival. And now, surrounded by her talented and beautiful peers, she was just excited to see the most talented and beautiful of them all.</p><p>“Flirt.”</p><p>“Such a shame you’re straight.”</p><p>“Is anyone these days?”</p><p>Rio laughed and raised her brows, “Then you’re telling me I have a shot?”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>A hand on Rio’s lower back and a soft voice told her Agatha had arrived and Rio’s teasing smile softened as she looked over her shoulder to see Agatha arrive by her side, her hand still comfortably on her back.</p><p>“Am I interrupting something?”</p><p>“Just the usual flirting,” Jessica said breezily as she smiled at Agatha, not daring to lean in and greet her properly.</p><p>But Rio did. She reached her arm back around Agatha’s shoulders and leant in to kiss her cheek.</p><p>“Flirting?”</p><p>Rio had barely pulled back before Agatha was asking the question, her blue eyes bright and her smile frozen in place on her face.</p><p>“Well I can’t flirt with you, being a married woman and all.”</p><p>“I’m not sure that would stop you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio shot Jessica a playful glare and then turned back to Agatha, seeing her eyes flicker across her face, not settling on her gaze. “I’m an excellent flirt. Just sharing the love.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and Rio felt her hand move around to her hip, pulling her in closer to her side.</p><p>Rio’s smile widened and she settled more against Agatha, her own arm still draped across her upper back. Agatha had opted for a black dress with a floral pattern across it and a scoop at the neckline that Rio had to fight hard not to focus in on.</p><p>“So, got a date to the big event?”</p><p>“My parents.”</p><p>Jessica smiled and turned her attention to Agatha, the person Rio knew she really wanted to chat to. “Agatha? Are you taking Ralph?”</p><p>“Who else?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers squeezed Rio’s hip and Rio bit the corner of her lip.</p><p>“He’s handsome,” Jessica said with a smile that was getting more delighted by the second, assuming as she did that Agatha Harkness was interested in her compliments about her husband. “Tall, too. You’re this, like, crazy beautiful couple.”</p><p>Rio wondered if she’d ever been as starstruck as Jessica currently was around Agatha and had to force herself not to think of how she’d acted around her when they first met for fear she’d give herself away and blush.</p><p>But Jessica was doing an incredible job of looking like a deer in the headlines as she addressed Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said demurely, turning her head away from Jessica to look at Rio and leaning away as she did to get a better look at her.</p><p>“Maybe Rio could learn from me and find someone tall and beautiful for herself.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and before she could respond Jessica had jumped in. “My money’s on Wanda.”</p><p><em>Jesus</em></p><p>“Not my type,” Rio said quickly, her hand now sliding down Agatha’s back, her fingers resting perilously close to the curve of her ass. “More into brunettes.”</p><p>Agatha had pulled away completely now but not before squeezing Rio’s hip. “Well I’m not sure you’ll get lucky here.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>Rio shot Agatha a hopeful smile and Agatha avoided her gaze.</p><p>“Keep flirting and you might,” Jessica said with a grin in Rio’s direction before turning to Agatha. “So, Agatha, how’s the kid? Nicholas, is it?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t have her arm around Rio anymore and so Rio decided she couldn’t just keep touching the most admired woman in the room. She pulled away and shot Jessica a quick goodbye smile before she turned to leave but found her hand had been snatched up and she was being pulled back to Agatha so roughly that she collided with her side.</p><p>Jessica was so dazzled by Agatha that she didn’t really notice and Rio managed to play it off, just.</p><p>“He’s fine, thank you. I’ve just bought him a season ticket to the Celtics so he’s over the moon.”</p><p>“You have?” Rio adjusted her stance to step back a little from Agatha but placed her hand on her back again. “What about the Bulls?”</p><p>“Ralph will just have to deal with the fact that Nicky’s not a Bulls fan.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond, momentarily struck dumb by Agatha’s matter-of-fact tone, but Jessica had beat her to it: “He likes basketball? Oh wait. You went to a game together, right?”</p><p>Rio could only nod, and turned from Agatha to her friend with a smile, “Yeah. Experienced life as a mega star for a day. It was…” Agatha stepped a little closer to her side again and Rio thought she caught her checking her out from the corner of her eye. “Frightening how crazy people get around Agatha.”</p><p>“Rio was our protector.” Rio blinked and turned in surprise to Agatha as she smiled up at Jessica, “She kept us safe. She was so diligent about making sure Nicky was okay in the crowds and with the paps. It was… incredible.”</p><p>Was Agatha <em>bragging</em> about her?</p><p>“A superhero? Rio, who knew you had it in you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at Jessica but felt her cheeks flush all the same.</p><p>“Anyway, Agatha, I haven’t had a chance all this time to tell you <em>how</em> incredible you are in <em>No Heaven</em>. It was honestly a revelation. I’ve been doing a lot of dream work lately with my acting coach and I-…”</p><p>Rio’s attention began to drift. A, being in this sort of conversation about acting always made her feel a little queasy, and B, because Agatha’s arm had slipped not only around her waist but somehow under her blazer. Her warm skin was now against Rio’s and her long fingers had curled around her side. It felt illegal to be here like this with her, so casually leaning against each other, so deliciously close and perilously open.</p><p>Her attention soon turned to Agatha and she watched her respond, saw the polite smile she kept on her face, the distant look in her eyes as she rattled off something about emotional cues or breath work.</p><p>Rio wondered how Agatha could stand being so idolised all the time, how she could comprehend the people around her always wanting to be near her but never knowing her. And suddenly, through the lens of Agatha as a movie star, the woman currently pressing her into her side made a little more sense.</p><p>Agatha had only really let Rio close. No one else.</p><p>No one, in the history of the world, had ever been closer to Agatha than she was.</p><p>And Rio felt the spark that had been trying to ignite before slowly die again.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hmm?” Rio’s head snapped around to Jessica and she blinked stupidly across at her as she felt Agatha’s fingers slide a little further up her ribs.</p><p>“I said we should go sit. I think you’re not too far from me, actually.”</p><p>Rio nodded and smiled and reluctantly pulled away from Agatha. She shot her a quick glance before she followed Jessica over to the large banquet table laid out with seasonal flowers and crystal glasses. Jessica dropped off their little group some way up the table and looked bereft as she took a seat beside a bald man in a beige suit.</p><p>Rio could only squeeze her shoulder for support and move on up. She scanned the place cards until she found her own and smiled when she saw who was next to her.</p><p>“Jen gave in?”</p><p>“Not exactly.”</p><p>Rio pulled out Agatha’s chair for her.</p><p>“You actually swapped them?”</p><p>“You catch on so quickly.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she helped Agatha push her chair in and took up her seat beside her, “Jen will be pissed.”</p><p>“I don’t care, do you?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand landed on Rio’s thigh as she settled in and Rio rolled her eyes as if it didn’t affect her and placed her hand on top of Agatha’s, sliding it up just an inch or two. Blue eyes darted down to the movement and Agatha’s fingers flexed before she spoke again: “Is this the kind of flirting only I have access to?”</p><p>Rio laughed as she removed her hand from Agatha’s and made eyes at someone familiar across the way, taking a second to wave before she turned back to Agatha, “The kind of flirting you have access to is not luncheon appropriate.”</p><p>“Can it be week away by ourselves appropriate?”</p><p>“Without a doubt.”</p><p>Rio’s earlier wave had been interpreted as a waving over and so Agatha’s smirk had to quickly morph into a smile as they were pounced on by their acquaintances. Rio was left with the memory of Agatha’s warm hand against her as she turned to commit to the act of charming Oscar nominee.</p><p>By the time Rio’s smile was beginning to feel tight on her face, the food was beginning to arrive along the banquet tables and so Rio was saved from her cheek pain as people once again moved away.</p><p>She turned back as Agatha did and smiled more genuinely when Agatha muttered, “Kiss asses.”</p><p>“Hey, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio looked up and smiled genuinely again at the sight of Wanda Maximoff leaning across the table to her. She stood and lean too, just about managing a quick cheek kiss without knocking over the carafe of water directly beneath her.</p><p>“Where have you been?”</p><p>“Oh, trying my best to charm Hollywood’s elite.”</p><p>Rio grinned as she sat down again and Wanda turned to Agatha, still leaning across and holding her arm out to her. “Agatha, so great to see you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Rio kicked her under the table. Agatha still didn’t move.</p><p>“So,” Rio said quickly to recover the awkward moment as Wanda schooled her face and sat down again. “Getting ready for jingle bells and making merry?”</p><p>“God,” Wanda’s facade fell completely as she took her seat and helped push the chair out for an arriving Lilia. “Apparently the studio is still arguing schedules.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Some bullshit about some pickups that I just don’t understand. We’d scheduled those for later in the year so I don’t know where all this has come from.”</p><p>“But,” Rio frowned as a waiter leant in to fill her glass with champagne, “We start in two weeks.”</p><p>“It’ll sort itself,” Wanda said with a reassuring smile and a hand held out to Rio across the table. Rio could only take it but felt as her fingers came into contact with Wanda’s a hand back on her thigh, at least two inches higher than it had been earlier.</p><p>“Perhaps the studio is looking for a reason to get rid of you.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Rio turned to the woman beside her then who shrugged like she didn’t know what she’d just said and pulled away her hand from Rio. “It’s a possibility.”</p><p>A laugh escaped Rio’s lips as she pulled her hand from Wanda and stared incredulously at the woman now sipping her champagne and looking down the table as if she hadn’t just been openly rude to one of the nicest people in Hollywood.</p><p>“It’s fine, Rio,” Wanda said softly, but loud enough for Agatha to hear too.</p><p>And Rio knew that was the wrong thing to do the moment she felt Agatha shift beside her, her ankle looping underneath her own and her jaw - from what Rio could see out of the corner of her eye - suddenly tight.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t say anything else.</p><p>“Did you get my flowers?” It was going to be a long lunch.</p><p>Wanda’s question made Agatha sniff loudly and Rio wished suddenly that Agatha hadn’t switched the seating plan because this could be a conversation between herself and Wanda that Agatha didn’t need to be privy to.</p><p>“Didn’t you get my text?”</p><p>And Rio caught something she wasn’t expecting in Wanda’s face: triumph.</p><p>She glanced aside at Agatha and saw that her jaw was working overtime and then turned back to the redhead and suddenly realised what she was doing.</p><p>“Wanda?” She said urgently, standing as she said it, “Do you need the bathroom?”</p><p>“No, babe.”</p><p>“Okay well I do and you should come with.”</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her but she couldn’t look back. She needed to speak to Wanda.</p><p>Wanda nodded once and murmured a soft apology to Lilia beside her as she stood and went to follow Rio as they walked down opposite sides of the table, met at the top, and allowed Rio to take her arm and pull her to the bathroom.</p><p>“Everything okay?” Wanda asked as they stepped inside and Rio moved to check under all the stalls.</p><p>Satisfied that they were alone she sighed and ran her hands through her hair, “I know Agatha can be difficult.”</p><p>“She hates me, Rio.”</p><p>“She doesn’t hate-…”</p><p>“She does and I think I know why.”</p><p>Rio went to lean back against the counter and looked down at her feet as she waited for the inevitable denial she’d have to deliver. She tensed her body, prepared her face to be as neutral as possible, shifted slightly when Wanda moved closer, “She wanted my part in the movie.”</p><p>Okay, she’d read that very wrong. She looked up and almost laughed in Wanda’s face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“She wanted the part. I overheard my manager talking at the BAFTAs with Stark and Agatha’s name come up so I… I think she wanted my part and she’s pissed that I got it.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>“It makes sense. It’s the part she’d have been up for… other than yours but that was changed after the scripts went out. It was on The Black List five years in a row and it’s already getting buzz. Plus you’re going to get the Oscar so I’m sure she thinks that she could get herself in with Supporting on this one.”</p><p>Rio felt like her brain was on go-slow mode, like she’d swallowed an ambien without realising. But she couldn’t let on to Wanda that she was way off the mark. Agatha didn’t want her part. Agatha had no interest in being in the movie.</p><p>Wanda was still talking and Rio didn’t realise that she hadn’t been listening until she heard her name.</p><p>“… and then there’s you, Rio.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about you too.”</p><p>Rio shifted where she stood and frowned as the door opened and a familiar looking producer came in, shot them both a smile, and disappeared into a stall.</p><p>Wanda moved in closer and lowered her voice to a whisper, “I think she wants you.”</p><p>On the counter Wanda’s hand found Rio’s and Rio looked down at it, watching her own fingers move to curl around the ones that now held them.</p><p>“Wanda that… that’s just not true.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?”</p><p>“No,” Rio lied softly, looking up into earnest green eyes, “It isn’t.”</p><p>“I think it is. And I think you know it is and I think the reason you got so sloppy in London was-…”</p><p>The producer had finished in the cubicle and came out to the far sink to wash her hands. Rio dropped her gaze to the floor and cleared her throat. They were both silent until they were alone again.</p><p>“Because maybe something’s going on between you. Actual or just the potential of… I don’t want to know either way, really. It’s hard enough knowing you have feelings for her without…”</p><p>She trailed off and Rio squeezed her hand gently. She took a second to breathe in and then said slowly, “Wanda, you know she’s married. She has Nicky.”</p><p>Wanda nodded, dropped Rio’s hand and looked into the mirror before her under the pretence of fixing her hair. “I know. I don’t want to know what’s going on, Rio. And maybe I’ve only noticed because I notice everything you do but… I won’t say anything, okay? <em>If</em> there even is anything to say, no one will hear it from me.”</p><p>“There isn’t,” Rio lied again, her gaze on the tiled floor before her as Wanda moved in to kiss her cheek, making Rio’s head turn to catch her eye.</p><p>“Okay, well, if you could at least try and put in a good word for me with her?”</p><p>Rio smiled sadly and nodded, knowing whatever she said to Agatha about Wanda would never work.</p><p>“I’m excited to be married to you, Rio Vidal. If only in pretend.”</p><p>A true smile returned to Rio’s face and she relaxed her shoulders slightly as she nodded, “You too.”</p><p>Wanda grinned and went to move away but Rio grabbed her arm and huffed as she pulled her into a tight squeeze. The other woman relaxed against her immediately and Rio smiled as she hugged her tightly, “Maybe try to stick to neutral topics with Agatha at the table, okay? The weather, the food, things like that.”</p><p>Wanda laughed as she pulled away and Rio grinned at her as she did. “Got it. It’s sunny and the food is delicious. Easy.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and stepped around Wanda to pull her back out of the bathroom, “I’m sure you can make it more exciting than that. I believe in your acting abilities.”</p><p>“I am an Oscar nominee after all.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she ripped the door open and came face to face with Agatha. Wanda stumbled into her back where she still held Rio’s hand and made a soft grunting noise when she did.</p><p>Rio’s laughter had died on her lips and she stepped aside for Agatha, moving Wanda behind her. Agatha’s face was neutral but Rio caught a flash in her eyes as she stepped past them and Rio hesitated for just a second before she released Wanda’s hand.</p><p>It was risky, she knew that, staying back with Agatha would confirm Wanda’s suspicions but her desire to be alone with Agatha for even a few moments was stronger than her fear of Wanda being less than her word.</p><p>So she stayed. She motioned for Wanda to head back and stepped back into the room, closing the door behind her. Rio looked over at Agatha now standing tall by the sink and washing her hands.</p><p>“Have fun with Wanda?”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio breathed out, “Don’t be like that.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek as she went over to Agatha and brushed her hair aside to kiss the soft skin at the base of her neck. Agatha smelled like perfume and body lotion and Rio would have buried her face against her skin for the duration of the luncheon if she could get away with it.</p><p>“Jealous.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed at the word breathed across her neck and Rio looked up over her shoulder as Agatha locked eyes with her through the mirror, “I’m not.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and went to lean against the counter next to Agatha, reaching for her to make her move before her. But Agatha wouldn’t budge.</p><p>“What did you need to speak with her about?”</p><p>“Are you really not going to move?”</p><p>“Anyone could walk in.”</p><p>Rio sighed softly and dropped her hand from where it had been curled around Agatha’s hip. “I thought she seemed a little curious about your reactions. I wanted to see what she thought.”</p><p>“What reactions?”</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know, how mean you are to her.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, “Then she should keep her hands to herself. And perhaps grow up.”</p><p>“Her hands?”</p><p>“She’s always-,” the door opened and someone walked in that neither of them turned to see, but Agatha shot Rio a look as if to say: “see?!”</p><p>She sighed when the cubicle door closed and whispered, “Always holding your hand or kissing you or-…”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the grin that crept up her face as Agatha continued to scowl at her. “It’s not funny.”</p><p>“You’re funny.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio actually laughed then, risking it all as she launched at Agatha and gave her a quick kiss to her lips, grinning as she pulled away and pleased to see that Agatha had softened even a little.</p><p>“It’s still not funny,” she hissed as Rio laughed again, but her lips twitching at the sides told Rio everything she needed to know as she pushed off the counter and in a loud voice announced, “I’m starved. I’ll see you back at the table?”</p><p>“<em>Come here</em>” Agatha mouthed as Rio reached the door.</p><p>Retracing her steps Rio raised her brows as Agatha reached with a quick but delicate touch to adjust Rio’s necklace. Just as quickly she took up Rio’s right hand and stole a gold ring and placed it on her own finger, her middle on her left, though Rio’s heart had stopped for a brief moment when she’d gone to place it on her left hand thinking she might put it on her empty ring finger.</p><p>“Go,” she instructed without another word and turned away from Rio just as the cubicle door opened, Rio shot the woman who’d emerged from it a quick smile, and then left without saying anything else.</p><p>Returning to her seat, Rio caught Wanda’s eye and saw her deep in conversation with Lilia. She smiled and received a soft smile back and she knew her decision to focus on Agatha had been the right one.</p><p>But she couldn’t focus on her all day.</p><p>The woman to her left was a sound engineer and Rio soon discovered that she was a keen botanist in her spare time and so for the next twenty minutes between this course and the next, she was deep in conversation about plant life of all kinds. She’d soon discovered the ways in which she could revive some of her woebegone houseplants: “oh the aspidistra doesn’t need much, just leave it and it’ll come back”, “sounds a goner, I’m afraid”, “if you’ve just repotted it, add some sugar water, it’ll help”.</p><p>Only two minutes after she’d sat down, she’d found that Agatha’s hand had taken to nudging her own every chance she got. And eventually they’d silently worked out that if Rio held her wine glass in her right and Agatha did the same in her left, every so often their knuckles could brush when either of them went to take a drink then place their glass back down.</p><p>Rio’s stomach jolted with every touch, and her cheeks felt pleasantly warmed now because she was drinking more just to get to touch Agatha more frequently.</p><p>But she couldn’t talk about plants forever. Conversations carried and moved and Rio floated with the tide until she was turning back around and her attention was on Agatha whose own attention was on Wanda.</p><p>“… we used to travel the country visiting schools and performing in these silly little skits, you know? Plays about the dangers of drugs or, you know, stranger danger.” Wanda laughed as she threw her hands about. “Really hard-hitting stuff.”</p><p>“We all start somewhere,” Lilia said not unkindly, which Rio was grateful for because she couldn’t imagine Agatha’s response would have been kind.</p><p>“Improv for me,” Rio added, though she knew Wanda and Agatha already knew this. “Thought I’d be resigned to frat boy comedies all my life.”</p><p>“Noooo,” Wanda trilled, “Too good for that. Too <em>talented</em> for that.”</p><p>Agatha’s knuckle brushed her own.</p><p>“I paid my dues,” Rio grinned, moving her ankle to loop around Agatha’s as if it were the most casual thing in the world.</p><p>“And now you’re reaping the rewards,” Agatha uttered, turning her head and resting her chin against her own shoulder as she smiled at Rio, “In the form of a gold man soon, I’m sure.”</p><p>“Oh for sure it’s Rio’s,” Wanda announced with a laugh, louder and more open about her endorsement because unlike Agatha, she had nothing to hide. “Hope the speech is ready.”</p><p>Rio tore her eyes away from Agatha and smiled over at Wanda, “Hardly. I’m preparing my gracious loser face as Harkness here takes it out from under both of us.”</p><p>“Harkness,” Agatha scoffed quietly, jolting their joined ankles as a playful warning to Rio.</p><p>Rio hummed as she leant away to allow the waiter to lean in and refill glasses and she swirled her wine before taking a sip and replacing her hand on the table to nudge at Agatha.</p><p>“What are you working on next, Agatha? I haven’t seen your name in Deadline for a while.”</p><p>“Oh, nothing very exciting.”</p><p>“No?” Rio asked curiously, realising she didn’t know what Agatha was doing next. “What is it?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and took a sip of her wine, “As of yet unconfirmed. But hopefully soon.”</p><p>Rio eyed Agatha suspiciously for a second but dropped her sceptical thoughts when Wanda addressed her again. “Whatever it is I’m sure it’ll be incredible.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything in response but Rio applied pressure to Agatha’s ankle to let her know it hadn’t gone unnoticed. After that, the rest of the lunch went by quickly because people had decided the food wasn’t worth the separation from the people they really wanted to be close to.</p><p>At one point Jessica snuck over and sank into Rio’s lap before Rio could stop it but she refrained from wrapping her arms around her and instead made a show of draping her arms over the backs of Agatha’s and the sound engineers chairs.</p><p>Jessica had only come over to share some gossip about a studio head though so didn’t stay long before she trotted off to share her news with everyone else she even vaguely knew. Agatha’s hand found it’s way to Rio’s lap for the remainder of the lunch and Rio covered it with her napkin in case any passers by happened to spot Agatha Harkness feeling up a fellow actress.</p><p>When lunch was over and people began to truly move again, Rio made the risky decision to lean into Agatha and press a kiss to her cheek. She lingered for a second or two and pulled away to find Agatha’s face to be far from annoyed or embarrassed as she thought it might be and instead simply soft, open, and pleased.</p><p>“I promised Alice I’d take some pictures with my cast but I’ll find you before the group picture?”</p><p>Agatha nodded silently, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips as Rio stood up and left.</p><p>“Rio Vidal!” Rio and a handful of people close by who heard the call turned to look around at Agatha in surprise, “¿Me guardas un asiento?” <em>Save me a seat?</em></p><p>Rio’s face almost cracked in half with the breadth of her smile, “Obviamente.”</p><p>Agatha inclined her head a little towards her and Rio turned just as she saw a few fans swoop in on her. Agatha was getting bolder in her responses to Rio and Rio couldn’t believe it. She was visually more delighted when Rio was around, she held her closer, talked mostly on to her, and now was shouting after her to make sure they could be together.</p><p>And she’d taken her ring. Maybe something no one else would notice but something that Agatha had done for <em>her</em> to make her feel connected and claimed.</p><p>She found it a harder task than usual to find her fellow cast and crew - everyone from the movie nominated. They were all in various corners talking to the people they admired most and so even Rio’s charms had to work extra hard to get most to pull away and agree to some social media fodder.</p><p>But she did it for Alice.</p><p>By the time there was the call to make their way in for the group photo Rio had captured enough content for Alice to sing her praises for a week. She traipsed into the theatre arm in arm with her director and took a seat in the second to last row off to the right of the centre.</p><p>In the kindest way she possibly could she dissuaded a Best Supporting Actor nominee from taking the free seat beside her and waited impatiently for Agatha to show so she could wave her over.</p><p>She eventually did and Rio had the unparalleled joy of watching her climb the steps up to her. People turned to look and Rio couldn’t blame them but she noticed Agatha only looked where she was going and up to Rio and she felt a swell of smugness in her chest as Agatha eventually arrived and took Rio’s hand as she settled into her seat.</p><p>“You made it.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t miss this for the world.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she released Agatha’s hand and slipped her own below the arm rest between them to instead rest on Agatha’s thigh. It wasn’t comfortable, and she couldn’t get the hold she wanted, but Agatha could read her so well now that she didn’t need to adjust and instead Agatha shuffled closer to her, and Rio flexed her fingers against her thigh more solidly.</p><p>“Miss me?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and Agatha grinned at her as she reached for her hand, draping her free arm over Rio’s chair as casually as if they’d been alone.</p><p>As if to give Rio the time she needed to indulge herself with this new angle of Agatha’s body so close and on show for her, Agatha addressed Rio’s director and Rio let her eyes roam across Agatha’s chest, briefly wondering if she could get away with a quick kiss to her warm skin if she pretended she’d fallen. Because people falling in stationary chairs happened all the time she reasoned as she continued to stare at the place she’d like to fall into.</p><p>“Honey,” she heard, “you’re staring.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and blinked, turning away quickly and removing her hand from Agatha’s thigh as if distance was the same as hiding.</p><p>“Admiring,” she corrected quietly, clearing her throat as she did.</p><p>She heard Agatha laugh beside her but didn’t turn around again as the photographer started to climb up the ladder placed on the stage to take the picture. She didn’t look when Agatha took her arm and placed it on the armrest between them. She didn’t look when Agatha linked their fingers on said armrest and she didn’t look when Agatha lifted her hand to kiss the back of it sweetly.</p><p>She simply schooled her blushing face, let Agatha manoeuvre her in any way she wanted and smiled for the camera. The photo would be used in industry press until it was replaced by the inevitable winners in each category.</p><p>But it would be preserved in perpetuity for decades to come: The Academy’s Nominees of 2025.</p><p>Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal hand in hand at the very back of the photo, both grinning, both not believing their luck.</p><p>Rio didn’t see Agatha much after the photo was taken. They were whisked into separate conversations with people they’d really rather ignore. But for the sake of remaining in the industry where only the most popular survived they tolerated the distance for another hour or so before the event was over and everyone went their separate ways.</p><p>Agatha was waiting outside with Lilia when Rio found her and she moved to kiss her cheek and indulge in the feel of Agatha wrapping her arms around her one last time before she dashed off for her car.</p><p>She managed to kiss the very corner of her lips before she pulled away, gave Lilia a quick kiss on the cheek, and then hurried to her waiting car.</p><p>It wasn’t until much later that evening that Rio heard from Agatha again - much later than she expected.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said softly, and Rio smiled into her phone as she responded: “Hey.”</p><p>“It’s late. Everything okay?”</p><p>“I was just thinking about you.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“At midnight?”</p><p>“It’s <em>almost</em> midnight.”</p><p>Rio laughed and reached for her toothbrush in it’s holder. “Can’t you sleep?”</p><p>“No, I was thinking about you.”</p><p>“Uh huh, and what exactly-…”</p><p>As Rio balanced her phone between her ear and shoulder she paused, glanced up at herself in the mirror. Agatha’s breaths were heavy. Her voice husky. What could have been attributed to tiredness or just having woken up wasn’t that at all. It was... “Are you…?”</p><p>There was silence for a second and then… Agatha moaned.</p><p>Rio dropped the phone and shouted a loud curse as she scrambled for it and slipped onto her ass on the tiled floor.</p><p>“Fuck, <em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed, and Rio groaned quietly as she wrestled with the tie of her shorts.</p><p>“Fuck me, Agatha.”</p><p>“Honey, talk to me.”</p><p>Rio whined as she finally loosened her shorts enough to slip her hand beneath them, “Fuck, I wish I were there.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Mmhm.” Rio groaned quietly, focusing solely on her clit, “I want to taste you, baby. Taste how badly you want me.”</p><p>“So badly,” Agatha breathed out and Rio squeezed her eyes closed, her fingers fumbling with how wet she already was.</p><p>“God you taste so fucking good. I need you to-…”</p><p>But her words were lost because Agatha had moaned so loudly and then everything went muffled and Rio stopped her own movements, frowning as she waited to hear what had happened.</p><p>Agatha was back. Agatha was breathless. “I… sorry, I…”</p><p>And Rio beamed, removing her hand from her shorts as she burst out laughing, “You came already? Agatha!”</p><p>“Shut. Up. I was all worked up and I’d already started and I miss you and I needed to hear your voice and-…”</p><p>Rio groaned and brought her knees to her chest, “Baby, we need to work on your stamina.”</p><p>“My stamina is fine, thank you very much.”</p><p>“No, I mean… we need to make you last longer.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and Rio continued to grin, “But perhaps we should focus first on the fact that you miss me and I was with you all afternoon.”</p><p>“It’s not the same.”</p><p>“I know. But it’s nice to hear you miss me.”</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly and Rio’s smile began to fade slowly, “I miss you all the time. Sometimes even when I’m with you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, began toying with the strings of her shorts. “You do?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. All the time.”</p><p>Rio but the inside of her cheek and suddenly felt her stomach churn with something that wasn’t desire but sadness and she closed her eyes as she leant her head back. “I miss you too. I want to hold your hand at the table and kiss you whenever I feel like it.”</p><p>“I know, honey.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and let the silence wash over her, the need to be beside Agatha stronger than usual now she had confirmation that Agatha missed her as much as she missed Agatha. But she’d already suspected it in Agatha’s boldness that day, in how she’d cling to her every chance she got.</p><p>“I’m kissing down your neck.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open.</p><p>“You’re naked and hot beneath me.”</p><p>“Holy shit,” Rio breathed, scrambling again to get her hand beneath her shorts.</p><p>“And you’re begging me to go faster, but I’m kissing you slowly, tasting your skin, sucking and biting until I leave my mark on you and you’re moaning.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were squeezed shut again, focusing on Agatha’s voice, “Jesus.”</p><p>“No, honey, <em>me</em>. I’m tasting you on my tongue, trailing down to your tits, and I’m reaching between your thighs.”</p><p>Rio whined quietly, pushing her fingers lower to press into herself. “Fuck.”</p><p>A noise made Rio drop her phone again and she cursed as she picked it back up but saw the FaceTime notification light the screen. She smiled as she answered it and was treated to a dimly lit vision of Agatha chewing on her lower lip.</p><p>“Is this okay? I want to see you.”</p><p>“Of course it is. Tell me how you want to see me.”</p><p>Rio stood on wobbling legs, a little mortified that she’d been caught sitting on the floor in the brightly lit bathroom.</p><p>“I haven’t done this before,” Agatha admitted with a frown as Rio glanced down at her and moved through to the more flattering light in the bedroom.</p><p>“You also hadn’t ever gone down on a woman before and I think it’s your best skill.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio grinned as she settled on the left side of her bed. “Tell me what you want.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while, her thoughts evident on her face but her lips unable to form them. “Take off your clothes.”</p><p>Rio smiled and sat up again to prop the phone against her bedside lamp. She made sure she was in frame as she threw her shirt over herself and then lifted her hips to slip from her shorts.</p><p>“Okay. What else?”</p><p>“Put the light on. I want to see you properly.”</p><p>Rio leant forwards and switched the bedside lamp on and knelt up on the bed to give Agatha a proper look at her.</p><p>“Don’t move,” Agatha instructed just before Rio got a full frontal view of the ceiling. Rio huffed and heard movement on the other end but Agatha didn’t return for at least thirty seconds and when she did Rio’s mouth fell open.</p><p>“Glasses?”</p><p>“Shut up I wanted to see you better.”</p><p>A grin slowly crept its way up Rio’s face and she clutched the sheets beneath her, “That’s unbelievably hot.”</p><p>“Don’t make fun.”</p><p>“Oh I’m not.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and Rio watched as she sat up against the headboard.</p><p>“Agatha? What do you want me to do?”</p><p>“I…” And Rio watched as Agatha hesitated, as she continued to stare at the sight of Rio naked and waiting on her phone screen. Rio could see herself in the corner, saw as her own hands reached up slowly to cup her breasts, how she squeezed them and released a performative gasp.</p><p>Agatha’s lips were parted and Rio saw her shift where she sat.</p><p>Rio moved slowly, waiting to see if Agatha would tell her to do something else, to change it up, to change the camera angle. But she remained silent and watchful.</p><p>And Rio showed off for her. She traced her own fingers down her body, caressing herself in a way she wished Agatha were doing. She spread her legs a little as she dipped her right hand down and ran her fingers slowly through her pussy, moaning as she did.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise and Rio knew she was fucking herself to the sight of Rio touching herself.</p><p>She grinned and moved her left hand back up to her breast as she began to slowly, showily, thrust two fingers in and out of herself, her hips angling a little forwards so Agatha could have a better view.</p><p>“I wish you were here,” she breathed, adding in a moan for extra affect. “Fuck, I wish it were your fingers inside of me.”</p><p>Agatha whined and Rio’s lips twitched as she curled her fingers inside herself and groaned.</p><p>“Rio. I… can…”</p><p>And Rio stopped what she was doing, sticking her tongue in her cheek as she watched Agatha deliberate and let her take her time in asking. “Do you have anything… bigger?”</p><p>And Rio moved her hand from inside herself, dropped her other from her breast and moved forwards to get a better view of Agatha in her phone. “Bigger?”</p><p>“Don’t make me say it.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly and reached across to open her beside table drawer. She made a show of deliberating for a while before she pulled out a hot pink vibrator and held it up for Agatha to see. It was large enough to get herself off without needing to lube up properly. Plus anything else she had was across the room and Rio wasn’t feeling patient enough to offer more options.</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio moved and sat back properly this time, but paused before she went any further. “Take off your shirt first.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“I want to look at your tits whilst I get off.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio was treated to another view of her ceiling before the camera was back up and she could see Agatha’s naked torso properly, her oversized glasses still on her face. “God I miss you.”</p><p>“Shut up and put that inside you.”</p><p>“Getting more confident, are we?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as Rio settled back more and opened her legs for the camera. She heard Agatha gasp and she reached down to spread herself wide open and she ran the toy against herself, lubing it up before she entered herself slowly and moaned at the feeling.</p><p>She heard Agatha swear but closed her eyes for a second as she pictured Agatha doing this to her instead of herself. When she opened her eyes again Agatha was staring with wide eyes, her mouth wide open and her eyes dark on the small screen.</p><p>And Rio did all she could to keep her that way. She fucked herself slowly, keeping her eyes on Agatha’s through the screen, she moaned as she circled her clit and rocked her hips as she got close.</p><p>She heard Agatha come before she did and she smiled at the sight of her coming loose on her phone. “Feel good, baby?”</p><p>“Fuck, Rio.”</p><p>“In Berkeley,” Rio panted, her movements picking up as she felt close, “I want to do this in front of you, I want to see how badly you want it. Feel you so close.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and Rio came as she did, her eyes squeezing shut as her hips stuttered and she came around the toy, moaning Agatha’s name.</p><p>Agatha was silent as she watched and when Rio recovered enough to look back at her she looked frozen, so much so that Rio worried the connection had dropped. “Agatha?” She removed the toy with a groan, “Did you freeze?”</p><p>“No, I just,” Agatha cleared her throat and Rio groaned when she moved the angle so she could no longer see her tits.</p><p>Agatha was rubbing over her mouth, and Rio began chewing on her lip as she reached for the phone and held the camera closer to her face. “Have you… I mean… would you let me do that to you?”</p><p>“With this?” Rio held up the toy in question and smiled as Agatha looked shy all of a sudden.</p><p>“Rio I <em>really</em> want to fuck you with that.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha. I’ll bring it with me.”</p><p>“And… how would you feel about, about other toys?”</p><p>Agatha was running her hand through her hair as if to make this conversation much more casual than it was. She pushed her glasses further up her nose with her middle finger as Rio grinned. “Like what?”</p><p>“Okay I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”</p><p>The floodgates opened and Rio laughed, “Nooo, nooo, Agatha! Tell me. Tell me what you want.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and pushed her glasses to the top of her head, “I can’t explain it over FaceTime.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because it’s embarrassing.”</p><p>“Baby.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened as Agatha looked away from her phone and she sighed as she settled back against her headboard, “Okay. We can talk about whatever you want whenever you want. No pressure.”</p><p>Agatha looked down for a few seconds and Rio thought she might give in but instead she whispered, “I’ll see you in a couple days?”</p><p>“We can do this again tomorrow night, if you want? A pre-Oscars orgasm?”</p><p>“Ralph’s back tomorrow.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio sighed softly and Agatha looked back at her again through the phone.</p><p>“I should let you sleep.”</p><p>“Okay. Te amo, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath and then she was gone.</p>

<p>In 1929, in a private dining room in the Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, the first Academy Awards was held. The first recipient of the Best Actress Award was Janet Gaynor, who was awarded for her work in three films and remains to this day the only actress to ever be awarded by the Academy in one single year for multiple roles.</p><p>Janet was a silent film star. She had big brown eyes and was having an affair with a fellow actor.</p><p>Two of these things Rio Vidal could emphasise with.</p><p>The silent part, however, not so much.</p><p>She’d spent the whole day talking. She was talking about everything and anything because she was excited - and Rio always talked too much when she was excited, or nervous, or lying - but also because the one person she most wanted to talk to she couldn’t.</p><p>And hadn’t since she’d had phone sex with her two nights previously.</p><p>Her mom and dad had arrived around midday the day before the Oscars and Rio, though constantly badgered by Alice not to eat or drink too much, and to avoid “if at all possible, Rio” injuring herself in any major (or minor) way, had spent the time since their arrival lounging around and regaling them with stories of Hollywood parties past.</p><p>It was a trait she’d inherited from her dad: to tell stories and do her best to entertain when she wanted to put someone at ease. Only the person she’d been trying to put at ease this whole time was herself.</p><p>By the time the actual day of the Oscars rolled around, Rio was practically all talked out, and no more at ease.</p><p>But Miguel was there to help with that. And dios mío, he was working his magic on his daughter.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio. Would you <em>please</em> come here.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hear Alice because she was bent double laughing at something her dad had said. And her dad’s laughter was even louder than her own so Alice just didn’t stand a chance.</p><p>“Ellos están cortados de la misma tela.” <em>They’re cut from the same cloth.</em></p><p>Anna Vidal placed her hand on Alice’s shoulder and reached around her to offer a glass of champagne. “Dales diez minutos más, Alice. Este es un gran día para ambos.” <em>Give them ten more minutes, Alice. This is a big day for both of them</em>.</p><p>Alice grumbled but she’d always had trouble saying no to Rio’s mom so she took a sip of her champagne and watched as Rio snorted and her dad, with his rosy cheeks and watering eyes, slapped her back.</p><p>Alice’s phone began to buzz against her hip so she had to turn away from the father-daughter duo and answer the call.</p><p>That left Anna to rally the troops but there was little chance of <em>that</em> when Rio and Miguel were enjoying themselves too much.</p><p>“Mi vida!” Miguel announced the arrival of his wife with his arms open wide and his smile equally so as she’d moved closer to begin the extraction. “¿Como estas, hermosa?”</p><p>“Los dos le van a dar un infarto an Alice.” <em>The two of you are going to give Alice a heart attack.”</em></p><p>Rio’s laughter picked up and she began to claw at her mom, eventually convincing her to turn from her dad’s hold to move into her own. “She is just being dramatic. We have mucho tiempo!”</p><p>Anna laughed and kissed her daughter’s temple which made Rio grin, a big, cheesy, Oscar-nominated grin.</p><p>“Comportáte con esa pobre mujer.” <em>Behave for that poor woman.</em></p><p>Rio barked another laugh as her mom pulled out from her hold and held her cheeks in her hands, “Mija…”</p><p>Rio’s laughter died down and she nodded slowly and hummed as her dad gave her a “we’ve been told” look over her mom’s shoulder. Rio giggled again as her mom moved away and playfully tapped her dad’s cheek.</p><p>“Mala influencia,” Anna muttered as she moved away from her husband and unruly child and went back to her knitting on the couch.</p><p>“You’re in trouuuble,” Rio sang out to her dad who simply moved to kiss her temple in the same place her mom had and gave his daughter a tender squeeze.</p><p>“Behave now.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and slapped at her dad as he moved away, strutting his stuff in his daughter’s hotel suite to try his charms on his wife. Rio watched the little show, recognising, not for the first time, that she was a lot like her dad as she watched him turn on the charm with her mom.</p><p>Anna looked stern at first and then began to soften until eventually she was laughing into his arms and closing her eyes as Miguel kissed her cheek. But Rio’s enjoyment of this little spectacle was soon dampened by a tiny Asian woman with a big frown.</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Are you ready to allow the professionals to get to work now?”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said again, her grin now a permanent feature on her face. “Have I told you how beautiful you look today?”</p><p>“You’re so goddamn irritating.”</p><p>“I’ve been told.”</p><p>Alice shook her head but Rio caught her trying to hide her smile and she launched at her just as she turned away, “Lighten up!! Your best friend is nominated for an Oscar!”</p><p>Alice protested for a few seconds and then began to laugh as Rio’s excitement got her. Rio was like Gloria Estefan: but it wasn’t the rhythm that was gonna getcha, it was the goddamn enthusiasm.</p><p>In fact, <em>that</em> had been the joke that had made Rio and her dad laugh so hard in the first place.</p><p>“Holy shit, Rio.” Alice began to laugh harder as Rio clung to her and dragged her to the floor with her for no reason other than to encourage the laughter spilling from her friend’s mouth.</p><p>“Rio Elena Vidal!”</p><p>Even her mom middle-naming her didn’t stop her and it took her dad coming over with a wide grin and his hands held down to them as she squeezed the life and laughter out of Alice that made her relent and roll over. She caught his eyes and rolled her own as she accepted the help and was heaved up alongside her best friend.</p><p>“Tu madre te matará.” <em>Your mother will kill you.</em></p><p>Rio just laughed as she kissed her dad’s cheek and turned to Alice with that same, omnipresent grin, “Okay, okay. I’m willing to behave now.”</p><p>Alice was still laughing and was a little breathless with it as she tugged Rio down into a hug and Miguel left them to it. “Jen called,” she whispered into Rio’s ear, her laughter softening until it dissolved, “Nicky wants to see you.”</p><p>“Nicky?” Rio asked in surprise, significantly louder than Alice had just been. She shot a quick glance over at her parents but they didn’t seem to have heard and turned her head back into Alice’s embrace. “With Agatha?”</p><p>“Jen’s allowing her ten minutes and no more. So go and make yourself look like you haven’t just been wrestling on the floor and I’ll go get them.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth suddenly felt dry, her stomach churning in knots, “Alice I’m in my robe and my hair is wet and...”</p><p>“I’m sure she’s seen you looking worse.” Alice pulled back with a grin brighter than even Rio’s had been earlier and rubbed up and down her arms. “Go. Hair and makeup. Now.”</p><p>Rio huffed but her smile returned as she picked up her lukewarm coffee cup and went through to the living space in the suite where her glam squad were ready and waiting for her.</p><p>She was greeted like royalty and she bowed to them before she accepted the hugs and kisses that were her due as the Oscar Nominee on her big day. The music playing was softer than she’d expected but she supposed they had a long day ahead and the dance tunes would come on later.</p><p>She was ushered to a chair opposite the window and handed a glass of champagne once her coffee had been stolen.</p><p>“Espressos only now,” her stylist warned, “very little food for the rest of the day too.”</p><p>Rio grumbled her assent but closed her eyes readily when serums and cooling balms were applied to her still shower-warmed skin. Someone was behind her already tackling her wet hair and someone else was by her feet applying more creams and lotions.</p><p>Her mind drifted as the talk picked back up around her and she enjoyed the idle gossip of a team she’d come through this season with and now knew intimately. They exchanged rumours of divas falling out with certain designers and discussed which man might wear something other than a regular tux that night.</p><p>And the gossip calmed her excitement and further quashed the nerves only just now beginning to show themselves in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>But the sound of her suite door opening stole her attention not five minutes later and Rio turned her head just in time to see Alice marching in with two guests.</p><p>Agatha was wearing a soft cashmere sweater and light jeans, her hair was damp and down over her shoulders and she had that movie star glowy skin that Rio always so envied. She looked tired. It had been two days and Rio already missed her desperately. And then, at her side and clinging to her hand was Rio’s twin, wearing Spiderman pyjamas and clutching something in his hand.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio beamed at them and she made a move to extricate herself from her helpers.</p><p>“We won’t keep you,” Agatha reassured, her eyes briefly darting to the squad now scrambling to untangle themselves from Rio as she stood from her seat.</p><p>“That’s okay we have plenty of time.”</p><p>Rio thought she heard a soft exhale of a laugh from someone behind her holding a hairbrush but she ignored it as she moved over and, though she wanted to throw herself at Agatha first, she dropped down to her knees before Nicky. “Alice said you wanted to see me?”</p><p>Nicky smiled just a little but his gaze moved to the people behind Rio and he looked serious again, his cheeks flaming pink as he clutched at Agatha.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said as she watched this happen in real-time, “you know who else is here? My mom and dad. Do you remember them? Mom’s got all kinds of snacks! Why don’t we sit with them for a bit?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio stood quickly and turned to her waiting squad, “Ten minutes. I promise. Then I’m all yours.”</p><p>Turning back to Agatha she found a hand on her arm and soft lips against her cheek before she could even register it and her grin from earlier had returned without warning. Agatha had pulled away already but Alice caught Rio’s stupid smile and laughed at her but led the way into the main bedroom.</p><p>“I need to talk to you about how your skin does that glowy thing,” Rio muttered as they entered the room to a loud gasp of excitement from her mom and a laugh of joy from her dad.</p><p>“What glowy thing?” Agatha asked with a smirk as she reached for Rio’s hand.</p><p>“It just looks so good all the time and I-…” but Agatha’s hand was taken from her own as her mom came over and stole the woman she loved without even asking.</p><p>“¡Ay, Agatha, ya estás guapísima! ¡Qué gusto verte! ¡Y a Nicky también! ¡Qué niño tan adorable!” <em>Oh, Agatha, you look beautiful already! It is so lovely to see you! And Nicky too! Darling boy!</em></p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but allowed it and soon found that even as Agatha was pulled into a tight hug by her mom, she’d reached back out for her hand and Rio took it without hesitation. When Anna pulled back Agatha was suddenly kissing both of her dads cheeks and Rio could only smile as she watched on, their hands joined in midair.</p><p>Nicky, beside Agatha still, looked less shy now and was talking quietly to Anna as she crouched before him and Rio was surprised to hear Spanish from the little boy.</p><p>“He’s been practicing,” Agatha whispered in answer to Rio’s unspoken question, moving back closer again so their shoulders could bump.</p><p>“Adorable,” Rio whispered right back just as both Nicky and Anna looked up to her. She raised her brows in question and felt Agatha squeeze her hand and then pull away.</p><p>“Es más simpática de lo que parece.” <em>She’s nicer than she looks.</em></p><p>Her mom was grinning at Nicky and nudged him gently to move forwards to Rio and Rio still looked at him curiously as he moved over, being strangely shy for someone who she’d been throwing about the basketball court not that long ago.</p><p>“I made you this,” he suddenly said, back to English, back to being serious as he unfurled his fist and held up a small green origami flower.</p><p>Rio blinked down at it and then stole a glance at Agatha who was chewing on her lip now, her arm mysteriously comfortable where it sat now around her mother’s shoulders.</p><p>Rio looked back down again, then dropped to her knees and sat back against her ankles as she picked up the little flower from the little hand that offered it.</p><p>“For me?”</p><p>“It’s just like mama’s. Only green. For luck. And Celtics.”</p><p>Rio looked up as Nicky relaxed a little and smiled at her, twisting his hands together and rocking up on his tiptoes.</p><p>She heard her mom whisper something inaudible to Agatha and heard Agatha whisper back but Rio simply opened her arms out and pulled Nicky in for a hug, frowning even as she smiled.</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll keep it forever.”</p><p>“Just like mama’s.”</p><p>Rio nodded and swallowed thickly as she pulled back and held Nicky by his shoulders. “Just like your mama’s.”</p><p>Nicky was grinning now, much more relaxed than he had been in the room of strangers and from his breast pocket he pulled out the light blue flower made from Cannes Carlton note paper and held it up for Rio to inspect.</p><p>“Mama said I could keep it today so it’s safe for when she’s back home.”</p><p>Rio stared at the little flower, the little flower that she’d made almost nine months ago, now sitting pristine and blooming in Agatha’s son’s hand. She couldn’t find the words to say as she stared at it but Agatha had moved closer and was ducking down to be on Nicky’s level too. She’d placed her hand on Rio’s back.</p><p>“Honey, I think we should go now. Rio has to get ready.”</p><p>Rio’s mom had moved in too, understanding well enough without having to be told that her daughter needed a second. And Nicky happily turned to her, showing off the little blue flower that was almost as precious as he was.</p><p>“You kept it?” Rio asked quietly, turning her attention slowly to Agatha now watching her.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Agatha, that’s…”</p><p>Agatha only smiled and made to cup Rio’s hand that still held the little green creation. “He’s worked really hard on making it a good one.”</p><p>Rio released a soft, incredulous laugh as she watched Agatha and was only just able to stop herself from leaning in to kiss her. “Can’t you get ready here? Squeeze in with us?”</p><p>“Ralph’s here,” Agatha muttered quietly, something in her expression changing even as she glanced over to check on Nicky who was now being entertained by Miguel.</p><p>“Right, of course he is.”</p><p>Agatha leant in then, her hand still cupped beneath Rio’s, her breath warm against her cheek as she lingered close and kissed her there. “I wish we could.”</p><p>Rio nodded and smiled tightly, making to stand and offer her hand out to Agatha who took it and held on as she looked back to Nicky. “Nicky, honey, let’s get going.”</p><p>“¡Ah! ¿Ya? ¡No! Quédate con nosotros. Seguro que tenemos mejores aperitivos.” <em>Oh! Already? Stay with us! We have better snacks, I’m sure.</em></p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but her dad shot her a wink and she saw him glance at the hand that was still in Agatha’s. She blushed and dropped it.</p><p>“Nos encantaría, Anna. Pero tenemos que volver o mi jefa me mata. Y puede dar bastante miedo, ¿verdad, Nicky?” <em>We’d love to, Anna. But we need to get back or my manager will kill me. And she can be pretty scary, right, Nicky?</em></p><p>Rio stared at Agatha. This white woman who was brought up on the east coast with all sorts of privilege speaking impeccable Spanish to her Puerto Rican mother and sounding unbelievably sexy whilst doing it. Not to mention genuinely annoyed she couldn’t stay with them. She didn’t think she could be <em>more</em> in love.</p><p>“Actually,” Rio said quickly, turning to her mom with raised brows, “Could you watch Nicky for a second?”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said in a low voice but Rio was already moving, already grabbing Agatha and pulling her through the suite to the second bedroom where she closed the door but not before she heard Alice shouting after them: “Five minutes, Rio Vidal!”</p><p>Agatha looked a little panicked but hadn’t protested as Rio had practically dragged her across the suite. Blue eyes flashed to Rio’s hand as she clicked the lock and she whispered, “Rio. Not here. Not-…”</p><p>“I just want to talk.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened and closed and Rio watched as she took a step back. Rio stepped forwards. “Agatha.”</p><p>“Rio, this looks so suspicious.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly but moved closer again, “I won’t get another chance.”</p><p>Agatha blinked as Rio placed her hands on her face and held her still. She watched her for a second, searched for any protest that might make its way past Agatha’s lips, and seeing none coming, she closed the distance and kissed her.</p><p>The kiss was slow, the type of unrushed kiss with Agatha that Rio loved. They’d not had many of them. They’d certainly never had any where Rio’s family were so close by and Nicky was just behind the door.</p><p>It was a risky move.</p><p>But this was necessary. Rio needed it more than she could communicate, more than she could even admit to herself. And perhaps Agatha did too because she wrapped her arms immediately around Rio and held her to her as she kissed her back.</p><p>It didn’t last long. But Rio had achieved her goal of kissing the woman she loved on her big day. She’d tasted her tongue for all of a few precious seconds and felt her pressed against her.</p><p>And it had to be enough.</p><p>“That’s what you wanted to say?” Agatha asked quietly, now nudging their noses together with a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha laughed against her and Rio grinned as she stole another quick kiss. “Okay. We can go back now.”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha murmured, kissing Rio once more before Rio pulled away. She checked her robe was in place and then stepped out again, schooling her face into a neutral smile. Thankfully no one was waiting for them on the other side.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and touched her lips as she returned to where Alice, Nicky, and her parents were. She ignored Alice’s pointed stare and focused on Nicky instead.</p><p>“I guess I’ll see you soon?”</p><p>“For basketball?”</p><p>“For basketball.”</p><p>Nicky grinned and hugged her middle so Rio dropped down to hug him properly and he whispered “Good luck, Rio” and then went back to his mom.</p><p>“I’ll walk you out,” Rio said as Agatha kissed her mom’s cheek and took Nicky’s hand again.</p><p>Rio shot her mom a quick smile and pretended to ignore it as she heard her say to her dad: “¿Por qué no puede encontrar una mujer así?” <em>Why can’t she find a woman like that?</em></p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered under her breath as Agatha laughed beside her, shooting her a grin as Rio walked them to the little hallway and to the door. That’s where they stopped, Nicky diligently placing his mom’s flower back in his pocket and Rio gently toying with her own in her hand.</p><p>“Mom was right. Your Spanish <em>is</em> better than mine.”</p><p>“Are you really that surprised?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled as she ran her free hand through her hair to stop herself from reaching out to Agatha. “I guess I’ll see you at the ceremony? And Nicky, I’ll see you on the basketball court soon, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded furiously, “I’d like that please.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio laughed as she stepped to open the door. But a hand on her arm stopped her.</p><p>“Come and take pictures with me before you go? Jen can arrange with Alice.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked around into bright blue eyes, “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and released Rio’s arm to let her open the door and she and Nicky stepped out into the hallway. They started down it and Nicky turned halfway up to look back at Rio and he smiled when he saw her still standing there. They waved at each other and then he and Agatha rounded the corner and were gone.</p><p>Rio closed the door and her eyes with it, resting her forehead against the cream wood as she took a second to just breathe now that Agatha and Nicky were gone and the only reminders she had of them were the soft scent of Agatha’s perfume in the air and the little paper flower in her hand.</p><p>“¿Mi corazón?” Her dad’s voice was soft and Rio turned to look at him and sucked in a breath at the sight of his questioning gaze. “¿Estás enamorada, cariño?” <em>Are you in love, my darling?</em></p><p>Rio hesitated but knew there was no point in lying.</p><p>“Sí, papá.”</p><p>Miguel Vidal, a man who considered himself to be the luckiest man in the world because of his wife and daughter simply opened his arms out to Rio and gathered her in. He held her tightly as she held him and they remained quiet for a while before he said, in English, “Does she deserve your love?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded against her dad as she pulled back and wiped quickly at her eyes for fear they were betraying her.</p><p>“Does mom-…?”</p><p>“I suspected at Christmas and asked her her opinion but… I’m not sure she’s caught on. She likes her though. Likes her a lot.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and dropped her gaze to the scruff across her dad’s jaw that her mom was always trying to get him to shave. “You’re not ashamed of me?”</p><p>“I consider you the best thing in my life, mija, with your mother a close second. To be ashamed of you would be to be ashamed of myself. We can’t help who we fall in love with, cariño.”</p><p>Rio felt the promise of tears sting at her eyes but she managed to keep them at bay as her father cupped her cheeks and lifted her chin, “Go get ready, Rio. I’ll keep your mother occupied.”</p><p>Rio looked into the eyes of one of people who loved her most in the world. He had always been her constant champion, her partner in crime, a constant in a crazy world where everything was always changing but her father remained the same. She nodded, smiled, and stepped out of her dad’s embrace to head through to her glam squad again. Alice was waiting impatiently in her chair and shot her a tight smile as she went to replace her in the seat.</p><p>“Ready to rock and roll?”</p><p>She took a deep breath and nodded.</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>“I told your parents you were discussing a surprise for Nicky’s birthday.” Alice had leant in to whisper close to Rio’s ear.</p><p>Rio raised her brows but nodded slowly, catching on to Alice’s reasoning for her lie a little late.</p><p>“Don’t pull any shit like that again, okay? Not with the whole world watching, anyway.”</p><p>Alice kissed Rio’s shoulder as she settled in to be preened and prodded again and as her champagne flew to her hands, her feet and hair and face taken up by expert fingers, the atmosphere changed again. Everything and everyone became more relaxed.</p><p>And Rio zoned out with her little flower twirling in her fingers as she was transformed into a movie star.</p><p>An hour after Rio had said goodbye to Agatha, she was aware of her mom sneaking out the door. She returned twenty minutes later with news of the other camp along the corridor.</p><p>According to Anna Vidal: Nicky was reading on the bed, Ralph was taking a bath, and Agatha was having her hair done. And Anna had delivered them half of the snacks she’d brought for her daughter to enjoy so Rio was furious.</p><p>“¿Le negarías a ese niño su dulce regalo después de que te lo hubiera hecho?” <em>You would deny that little boy his candy after he made you that sweet gift?</em></p><p>Rio grumbled but eventually agreed that, no, she would not deny Nicky some candy.</p><p>This agreement was mostly fuelled by the fact that she wasn’t able to eat any of her mom’s offering anyway, due to cakes and snacks being regularly physically taken out of her hand by her stylist even as her dad continually tried to sneak them to her. Then again, even if she had full control over her calorie intake that day, she was pretty sure she wouldn’t deny Nicky anything. Though perhaps she’d keep the pilones rojos to herself… protect his teeth, y’know?</p><p>What she <em>was</em> allowed was a restricted amount of champagne - two glasses only. So she sipped delicately, trying to make them last longer even as everyone around her indulged in whatever food or drinks they wanted.</p><p>It couldn’t dim her shine, though. Rio was practically vibrating with excitement. She’d made Alice place her little flower in the clutch she’d be taking that evening for fear she’d crush it in her hand as the closer and closer they got to the ceremony, Rio’s fingers became more and more active, dancing and twitching, finding everything and anything they could to fiddle with.</p><p>And she found she was talking even more than usual, occasionally switching to Spanish even when speaking to her English-speaking glam squad, and having to rapidly switch back in order to be understood. Her brain felt more alive than it had in months and she found it difficult to focus on anything at all.</p><p>The whole day felt surreal in the best way. Everyone was acting like Rio had already won, like she’d already accepted the award and gushed about each and every one of them in her speech. They were all lavishing her with compliments, kissing her hands when they got close.</p><p>The hours flew by and Rio had transformed from a regular woman in a white robe to an Oscar nominee in a white dress.</p><p>Versace had dressed her again, and as their new ambassador, she was more than happy with the choices they’d offered. She’d eventually settled on a off-white floor length gown, with dramatic sleeves that created an elegant, Grecian column effect. The sleeves formed pillowy arches over her shoulders. It meant her mom could no longer kiss her as often as she had been all day, much to her makeup artist’s relief. The bodice was fitted with a modest scoop neckline that balanced out the impact of her sleeves and there was a gathered belt of fabric just at the waist and above the smooth, straight skirt.</p><p>Her jewellery was minimal. She wore silver, instead of her usual gold. Statement round earrings hung from her ears and on her right hand she had a large diamond ring in the shape of a flower, the second piece of flora she would carry with her to the ceremony that night.</p><p>She had revealed herself to her parents with a flourish, a demure curtesy, and a beaming smile. Her mother cried. Her father clapped.</p><p>Rio tried not to cry with her mom when she hugged her gingerly for fear she’d crease her dress or smudge her make up on it. And she continued this tricky line of not hugging and not smudging as the music was turned up and someone - her suspicions were on Miguel - turned the room into their own personal dance floor.</p><p>Tears turned to laughter as her dad span her mom around and Rio clapped from the sidelines, everyone too cautious with her to let her join in the fray as the squad and Alice all jumped to try and outdo the Vidals.</p><p>But no one could.</p><p>Miguel and Anna had eyes only for each other and Rio had eyes only for them; her supportive, kind, wonderful parents.</p><p>“¡Mi vida, no!” Miguel protested as Anna danced away from him and was the first person to pull Rio up, careful to touch only her bare arms and not jostle the dress as she dragged her over. And Miguel’s protests changed in an instant because dancing with his wife was one thing but dancing with his daughter too? Heaven to his own heart beat.</p><p>Anna, who now was just about confident enough to wrap her arm around her daughter’s waist, had been outfitted by Versace too, a favour Alice had called in at the behest of Rio. Her dad had received the same treatment and looked handsome in his brand new suit as he confidently danced beside them with the arrogance of a man who had it all.</p><p>And Rio, she laughed as she danced, all her nervous energy evaporating as she allowed herself to be twirled by her father, hip-bumped by her mother, and swayed by the familiar rhythm of Dancing Queen.</p><p>Alice only called for calm when she began to fear they’d all gladly skip the Oscars for a chance to remain in this moment forever and as she shouted for order, for the first time in her career, Rio begged her to take photos for socials. She wanted to capture this moment. To freeze her mom and dad in this time, and share them with the world.</p><p>They posed together as any family might that consisted of an excited daughter and enthusiastically proud parents. And Alice was roped in too, a pseudo-adopted Vidal. Rio then posed with her squad, adding to the plethora of footage that Alice had already filmed when she was getting ready.</p><p>And miraculously, they managed to get her out the door without ruining either her makeup or her dress. Alice filmed Rio as she walked down the hallway to Agatha’s room and she whooped and hollered as Rio turned to wink and blow a kiss to the camera.</p><p>It was easy to be charming when you had someone to charm.</p><p>She didn’t have to seek out Agatha’s door because Jen was already standing just outside it, waiting for the arrival of Rio and her posse.</p><p>“Holy shit, Vidal.” Rio laughed at the classic Alice phrase that tumbled from Jennifer’s lips. “You could take someone’s eyes out with those.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she placed a delicate kiss to Jen’s cheek, careful as she did not to press too hard for fear she’d ruin her lipstick. “You look beautiful too, Jen.”</p><p>“I thought that went without saying,” Jen grinned back, her hand now on Rio’s side as she motioned inside with her head. “It’s been a rough afternoon but she’s excited to see you.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked urgently but felt her family arrive behind her and Jen shook her head once before she plastered on a very false smile for the Vidals.</p><p>“Hi!”</p><p>Rio stepped into the hallway and the first thing she spotted was the face of a little boy peaking out from around the corner. Her worries disappeared as she grinned at him and he slowly moved into view properly, his Spiderman pyjamas now replaced by a green sweater and dark pants, though he had dinosaur socks on which Rio thought really tied the whole outfit together.</p><p>“Well don’t you look handsome.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Nicky grinned as Rio walked over to him and she bent down to offer one of her sleeves to him, “You like my sleeves, kid?”</p><p>Nicky reached to touch one but Rio pulled back suddenly, “Ah! You got clean hands? Let me check.”</p><p>He held them out and she inspected them for a second before nodding seriously and offered her shoulder back to him, “Then go ahead.”</p><p>He touched the sleeve cautiously and squeezed it like a bouncy ball before he laughed, “They look silly.”</p><p>“¡Ay, qué tonta! ¡Son preciosas!” <em>Silly! They are beautiful!</em> Anna Vidal had arrived to defend her child, stepping around Rio to pinch Nicky’s cheek affectionately.</p><p>“Sí,” he uttered with a giggle as he batted her away, “Como Rio.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but straightened up with a grin and turned her attention to the room beyond, “Where’s your mom?”</p><p>“She’s with daddy.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said softly, and moved into the living area where Agatha’s glam squad were quietly gossiping and packing up. She eyed them for a second, noting the way they kept their voices so low that even now being in the same room as them she couldn’t hear.</p><p>But Oscar nominees never go unnoticed for long.</p><p>Rio was spotted and soon she was launched upon, praised, and she found herself laughing in the middle of the room at a not very funny joke from a makeup assistant who looked so timid and so mortified that she’d even made the joke in the first place that Rio laughed until everyone else joined in.</p><p>Rio then managed to retain their names in her brain for long enough to introduce them to her parents and after hands had been shaken and Rio was beginning to get anxious to see Agatha, Jennifer stepped in to dismiss everyone and instruct them to make moves to clear out and give them some space.</p><p>Rio remembered what her own makeup artist had told her once about Agatha and her camp being a little more tense than her own and this only confirmed the gossip as Jen huffed as she rushed them all off.</p><p>She said her goodbyes and as the room cleared she spotted an unfamiliar face in the room too and Rio smiled at the woman who looked neat in a little cardigan and plaid pants. She had dark hair and a kindly, round face with equally round eyes.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said with a smile, “I’m Rio. I’m not sure we’ve met?”</p><p>“Lucy, hello. I’m Nicky’s nanny.”</p><p>Rio shook the woman’s hand. “Pleasure to meet you. I’m afraid I think my mom has given him a lot of sugar so…”</p><p>“Oh, I expect the crash will be big soon so don’t worry about it.”</p><p>Rio smiled but a door opening to her right made her turn and she saw Agatha standing there, and Rio Vidal suddenly couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“<em>Holy fucking shit</em>.”</p><p>Agatha was dressed in a black velvet gown with a sweep of the same fabric draped across her right shoulder that flowed dramatically out behind her. Along the edges of the draped fabric was a crystal fringe and the silhouette of the gown was tight to Agatha’s curves. Against her pale skin it looked rich, luxurious, old Hollywood.</p><p>Agatha’s hair was up in a twisted, loose knot. And her hair had been allowed to remain textured, alive. Not for the first time, Rio wanted to kiss her stylist.</p><p>Because this was <em>her</em> Agatha, only draped in velvet.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio mumbled just as Agatha rushed towards her and her eyes had barely seconds to try and take it all in. But Agatha was close now and had wrapped her arms securely around her waist. She angled her body away from Rio, pressing their hips together so she could look her over and Rio almost whimpered for seeing Agatha looking like this up close.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything as she held her but Rio caught sight of Ralph standing in the door of the room Agatha had just emerged from and he didn’t look pleased. She moved her hands, one to Agatha’s bare left arm, the other to hide indulgently beneath the draped fabric on her left. Her hold tightened significantly around Agatha and she felt Agatha respond in kind, her hands shifting and her fingers splaying across her back.</p><p>“Unorthodox to take pictures with the competition, no?”</p><p>Ralph’s voice was even more jarring than Rio remembered and she grimaced as her slipped past, not without touching her arm. Rio schooled her face as she turned her gaze to Agatha once more and for a brief second Agatha let her in.</p><p>This woman in her arms, holding her so carefully and so close, was flung out of time. Her blue eyes were bright and searching and Rio couldn’t look away from them. She showed her her sadness and Rio felt it in the squeeze of the hands still against her ribs, and read it in the blue eyes that had dropped to her lips.</p><p>“Ralph,” Jen snapped from somewhere behind Rio as Agatha fixed her face and pulled away.</p><p>“Come say hi to the Vidals. You missed them earlier, being in the bath and all.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Ralph, grimaced as she saw him checking her out, and just as she was about to turn to see him greet her parents Agatha tugged her hand, pulled her closer, and whispered against her ear, “You look so beautiful.”</p><p>“What’s happened?” Rio asked, turning her head slowly into Agatha, now just inches away from her. She ignored Agatha as she curiously touched her puffy sleeve.</p><p>“Nothing you need to worry about.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Baby.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled when Agatha moved her hand to hold her chin gently, “I haven’t heard a compliment yet.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure ‘holy fucking shit’ is a good enough response to seeing you.”</p><p>Agatha just hummed, a smile tugging at her lips as she dropped her hand and just as Rio moved to place her hand on Agatha’s waist in an attempt to get closer again her mom arrived at their sides. Rio watched as Agatha turned her charm up a few notches and she took the opportunity to check her out properly now her attention was on her mother.</p><p>Agatha’s pale hand had removed Rio’s from her hip and she held it loosely now, and to Rio’s surprise she reached her other arm around Rio, enveloping her beneath her velvet and giving Rio an unparalleled view of Agatha’s profile. Agatha didn’t react to Rio’s obvious staring and she focused in on Anna, her blue eyes crinkling a little at the sides as she smiled.</p><p>“Rio dice que estaré a tu lado.” <em>Rio says I’ll be next to you.</em></p><p>“Sí, entre nosotros.” <em>In between us.</em></p><p>Agatha twitched her arm around Rio and Rio pressed a little closer, slightly dazed as she clung on. Her thumb made soft, slow movements against Agatha’s hip and she made a mental note to somehow, at some point, make sure she could feel Agatha’s ass with the velvety fabric draped across it.</p><p>“No parece que eso sea algo que a Rio le gustaría.” <em>Doesn’t look like that’s something Rio will enjoy.</em></p><p>Anna Vidal glanced at where Rio was clinging to Agatha and Rio blushed, grateful the amount of makeup on her face meant it wouldn’t be visible. Agatha squeezed her side and answered before Rio could: “Me alegra que vayamos a estar juntos. Así podrás contarme más sobre Rio cuando era niña.” <em>Well I’m pleased we’ll be together. It means you can tell me more about Rio as a kid.</em></p><p>Anna laughed and Rio scowled, fighting off the butterflies that began to charge about her stomach. Agatha’s hold on her tightened as Rio tried to pull away but Anna had pinched Rio’s cheek, “Mi tonta niña.” <em>My silly little girl.</em></p><p>“Dooon’t,” Rio whined and batted at her mom’s hand, “Jasmine will kill you if you ruin my makeup.”</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said quietly, turning into Rio to brush over her cheek and fix nothing in particular as Anna laughed to herself and went to sit with Miguel.</p><p>The oxygen was sucked from the room as Rio looked up to meet Agatha’s gaze, and she had time enough to count four freckles across a perfect nose before Agatha pulled away.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Alice’s voice shocked her back to reality and she released Agatha to turn to her manager, raising her brows at her expectantly, “Come on. We need to do this and then leave.”</p><p>Rio sighed and shot Agatha a quick smile, “Let’s go.”</p><p>Ralph had disappeared again and for that Rio was grateful. She hoped he’d decided to take a bath again and would drown in it.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Nicky beside her dad and turned properly to see them, both sitting on the couch, Nicky with his legs swinging off the chair, both looking at the women with a mixture of awe and mild confusion.</p><p>“Hey, Nicky. Will you check I have everything in my purse?” Rio motioned to Alice to hand over her clutch and then pulled Agatha towards the window where they could get the best light and found that Agatha wasted no time in wrapping an arm around Rio as they turned to face Jen with her camera ready.</p><p>“I think this is lipstick,” Nicky was saying as he frowned into the clutch, his swinging legs now stationary so he could concentrate. “And this is… maybe lipstick too.”</p><p>“Mascara,” Jen corrected with an arched brow.</p><p>“A mirror,” Nicky continued and then looked up with a grin that Rio shot right back at him, “and your flower.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said with finality, “means I have everything. Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha’s arm around her flexed and Rio didn’t dare look at her but instead moved to stand with her arm around her too.</p><p>“The sleeves, Rio, it doesn’t work. Your shoulder looks weird,” Alice called out, “Move beside each other.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she stepped away and dropped her hold and Rio adjusted by brushing down her dress and making sure her sleeves hadn’t already lost their shape.</p><p>“Agatha, why don’t you sit and Rio can stand behind you.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha huffed, “It’s not a photoshoot, Jen. This is just a couple snaps for us… our socials.”</p><p>Rio grinned at Agatha’s slip up and muttered, “Casual, Harkness.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Well Jesus, Agatha,” Jen started but Anna had moved in between them, holding her hands up.</p><p>“¡Basta!” Rio bit down on her lip as she saw Jen’s eyes widen in shock. “Rio, conviértete en Agatha y gira la cabeza hacia la cámara. Sí, así. Más cerca, más cerca. ¡Sí! ¡Perfecto! Ahora, Jennifer, take the photo.” <em>Enough! Rio, turn into Agatha and turn your head to the camera. Yes, like that. Closer, closer. Yes! Perfect!</em></p><p>Rio’s arm was around Agatha and Agatha’s was around Rio, their opposite hips pressed together, Rio’s heart thrumming in her chest. She reached the arm closest to the camera to wrap around Agatha’s waist too and Agatha responded in kind by holding her elbow.</p><p>If she just reached down with her left hand she could get away with… she dropped her wrist, let her fingers graze the fabric over Agatha’s ass, brushing over it slowly until she returned her hand to Agatha’s hip. She heard her gasp quietly, twisting in Rio’s arms to press against her fully under the pretence of pulling Rio into a hug.</p><p>“Inappropriate,” she chastised as Rio’s hold relaxed around her and she laughed as Agatha’s breath tickled her ear.</p><p>“Jesus, you two.”</p><p>Rio heard Nicky giggle from across the room as Agatha jabbed her side to make her really laugh and she pulled away, not meeting Agatha’s gaze as she extracted herself from her - to avoid more temptation if nothing else.</p><p>“Pose like normal humans or I will not-…”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes beside her and adjusted them confidently so they could pose again.</p><p>The new, more casual hold lasted all of ten seconds as they allowed their photo to be taken but Rio could have held it for weeks.</p><p>When they finally broke away they locked eyes with each other and exchanged grins and Agatha blushed ever so slightly as she muttered, “New phone screen for you?”</p><p>“Oh you wish.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as Rio pulled away entirely but she felt the fingers that grazed her hip as she went over to Jen to check the pictures. She raised her gaze subtly to check Agatha hadn’t followed and bit her lip before she muttered for Jen’s ears only, “They fought.”</p><p>“Yes,” Jen whispered back, zooming in to make sure her client looked as perfect as could be in the snaps.</p><p>“Is he sus-…?”</p><p>“No. Just an ass.”</p><p>Rio nodded, Jen’s answer not making her feel any better about the situation because Ralph being an ass was only marginally better than Ralph being suspicious. Mostly because Agatha was married to him either way.</p><p>She looked over and saw Agatha leaning over Nicky on the couch and had to do her very best not to stare at the way the fabric of her dress clung to her ass as she did. But she didn’t have long to fight against it because Agatha was straightening and motioning to Jen for her phone.</p><p>“Rio, come back here. We need a picture of the Boston crew.”</p><p>“Boston crew?” Jen asked suspiciously as she handed Rio her phone.</p><p>“Celtics crew, more like,” Rio corrected with a smile as she went to hover by Agatha as she sat down on the armchair and pulled Nicky into her lap. Rio assessed for a second and then went to lean over them both from behind the armchair so she could stretch her arm out and frame them in the phone.</p><p>“These fucking sleeves,” she muttered as she adjusted herself to not crush them against the chair or Agatha’s head and Agatha only laughed as she watched the little show in the screen in front of her. Nicky giggled too.</p><p>Once satisfied and done with her huffing, Rio looked up at the screen and though she couldn’t be sure, she thought she could see Agatha meeting her gaze through the camera. It made her heart stop, made her whole body feel warm, and as she hit the peak of her spiral, she snapped the photo.</p><p>Rio straightened to check it and lost her breath at the sight. There was Agatha, glowing and grinning at the camera, sandwiched - and clearly happily so - between Rio and Nicky. A rose between two identical, beaming faces.</p><p>“Show me, Rio.” Agatha asked with her hand held out to take the phone and Rio handed it to her, watching as Agatha and her son looked at the image.</p><p>Rio looked up as she heard her mom whispering something to her dad and caught Jen’s gaze briefly and saw something she’d never seen before in her dark eyes; Jen looked terrified.</p><p>Rio missed Agatha holding the phone back up and asking for another as she strode over to Jennifer and without meaning to she snapped her out of her daze. “Can we talk?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“<em>Jen.</em>”</p><p>“Not <em>now</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“Honey, one sec,” Agatha said behind them, ushering Nicky off her lap so she could make it to Jennifer and Rio as they faced off together in the centre of the room.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Jen and Rio said at the same time - one with more conviction than the other.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha tried, reaching for Rio’s hand just as a door opened and Ralph appeared again, his bow tie hanging loose about his neck.</p><p>“Hon, could you tie this for me?”</p><p>Agatha shot Jen and Rio one last look and pressed Jen’s phone back to her before she moved around them and went to help Ralph.</p><p>Rio watched her go and turned to Jen who was already busying herself with her phone. She risked looking up at Rio only for a second and then the moment was gone and Rio knew she wouldn’t get the answers she needed that night.</p><p>But one answer was already in the room with her. Ralph was lifting his chin as Agatha swiftly fixed his bow tie and Rio knew with the right angle and the right amount of force she could quite easily snap his jaw.</p><p>“Mija,” Miguel said.</p><p>Thoughts of broken jaws and grateful Agathas dissolved in her mind as she turned to her dad.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio grinned again, remembering who and where she was. “Let’s go.”</p><p>“Finally,” Alice breathed, moving to kiss Jen goodbye before she held out her hand to Rio to pull her into the hall.</p><p>Rio didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to Agatha but she waved at Nicky and shot Agatha a small smile as she disappeared out the suite and down the hall with Alice and her parents in tow.</p><p>The image of Agatha fixing Ralph’s tie burned itself into her retinas, carving it insidious promise that Agatha wouldn’t leave this man into her fragile hopes. But then her dad’s hands found her arms and he gave her a squeeze as he walked proudly alongside her and Rio saw herself in his eyes for a second and she became proud, tall, and unashamed.</p><p>The little group gathered back outside Rio’s suite to pickup her makeup artist who would be hanging around in the wings all evening for quick touch ups during ad breaks.</p><p>And then they made their way, a spectrum of nervous and excited, to the Dolby Theatre where the 97th Academy Awards were being held.</p><p>The journey to the theatre took longer than expected due to the heavy amount of traffic as the constellations of stars descended upon Tinseltown for the biggest night of the year.</p><p>But Rio and Miguel kept everyone entertained, Miguel by telling old stories that everyone had heard a million times before of Rio dressing up and putting on skits when she was younger, and Rio by constantly interjecting and correcting small details that her dad was now purposefully getting wrong just so his daughter could correct him and be distracted from the nerves he knew would be bubbling away in her stomach.</p><p>Eventually, they arrived on the entrance to the carpet. And nothing her dad could do now would help with the nerves that threatened to show themselves in Rio’s throat any time soon.</p><p>The excitement she’d been dealing with all day was now eradicated as the door was opened and the roar of the crowds hit her properly for the first time. Rio knew this would be different. She knew it would be more intense than anything she’d ever experienced, but there was knowing and experiencing. Two very different things.</p><p>She was ushered away from her dad by a lady with a black earpiece and a clipboard and she just about managed to squeeze his hand one last time before she was pushed forwards. She had to enter the fray first, her parents and Alice now second class citizens as far as The Academy and the fans were concerned.</p><p>She held her head high, kept her sights forwards. She saw the red carpet, the photographers, the people with clipboards, men in tuxedoes, women in red-soled shoes. She felt the fabric of her dress, the heavy ring on her right hand, the pinch of her new shoes, the change from hard sidewalk to plush carpet beneath her feet. She heard the screams of her name, she heard the frantic instructions shouted into headsets, the noise of car doors opening and closing. She smelt the perfume of a woman brushing past her, the soft scent of jasmine that was typical of L.A. She tasted the mint gum she’d recently removed from her mouth.</p><p>But her anxiety was still through the roof.</p><p>A hand found her lower back and she didn’t need to turn to know who it was. Her mom was now with her, flagrantly ignoring the previous instruction from the attendant to stay behind Rio. Her mom knew she needed her to.</p><p>Rio took a breath, finding more solace in that delicate reminder of her mom’s presence than the 5-4-3-2-1 method she’d just been trying to work through.</p><p>She felt braver as she stepped from her mom’s comforting hold and into the centre of the carpet.</p><p>But she’d never heard her name being bellowed so loudly before.</p><p>Cacophonous and overwhelming, she grinned through the noise, posing as best she knew how in every direction the shouts came from. But it didn’t take long until her chest began to feel tight with anxiety.</p><p>Alice stepped in when she noticed the twitch of Rio’s fingers and Rio tried to fight the threat of her widening eyes as she was pulled to the edges of the carpet and into the safety of the crowds.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she gasped out, finding her mom’s hand quickly as she tried to focus on her breathing.</p><p>“It’s okay,” her mom whispered soothingly, brushing a gentle knuckle down her daughter’s cheek, “you’re doing so well, mija.”</p><p>Rio nodded and breathed out to the count of four as Alice guarded her from the front and began to move her up the carpet. Rio’s heart rate began to slow again but she felt tense still, jittery, even, and she wished she’d been able to finish her last glass of champagne before she’d arrived.</p><p>“Rio, we’ve got the first few press go rounds now, feeling up to them?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.”</p><p>Alice eyed her suspiciously but Rio nodded again and pulled her mom in closer, “I’m fine, really. Just nervous.”</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said quietly, shooting Anna a quick smile before leading them both to the first interviews.</p><p>Rio’s reception was like that of a conquering hero and she beamed as she introduced her mom and dad to the interviewers and fell back into her professional mode of being able to answer questions easily, charmingly, fluidly.</p><p>Having her parents by her side helped too.</p><p>Most questions were soft-balled because Anna and Miguel were there and Rio time and time again got to stand and smile shyly as Miguel Vidal told everyone who would listen just how proud he was of his daughter.</p><p>But the first round of interviews soon ended and Rio was directed to the centre of the carpet again. The little interlude of interviews with her parents had filled her up again so it took time before she was circling the drains of fear once more. She sucked in a breath and held it as she posed, as she smiled, as she endured the barrage.</p><p>And then, out of the corner of her eye, Agatha was standing waiting for her turn.</p><p>Rio dared to look properly, exhaling the breath she’d been holding for too long, and she saw Agatha smile at her. Agatha’s whole face lit up when she caught Rio’s gaze and she did something that made the world seem okay again: she winked. And Rio laughed at the sheer relief that she felt so viscerally when Agatha was close, when she was shining her light on her.</p><p>And the shouts changed. They were asking for Agatha now. Agatha and Rio. AgathaRio. AgathaRio! <em>AGATHARIO!</em></p><p>Rio held out her hand to the woman who looked calm and steady and found she didn’t have to wait long for Agatha to make her move to her.</p><p>They’d unknowingly already practiced how to stand together without Rio’s dress getting in the way. So they replicated the position they’d been in in Agatha’s suite, where they’d taken pictures just for themselves, and now allowed the world to see them as they posed together, arms so comfortable around the other that they didn’t even have to look as they slotted into one another.</p><p>“Alice said you’re anxious?”</p><p>Agatha spoke from the side of her mouth, muttering to Rio without moving her lips as best she could.</p><p>“Well I’m better now.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and used it for the photographers to capture even as she turned her gaze to Rio, “Because of me?”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha and felt her fingers flex against her arm, “Pushing it.”</p><p>“Get a drink with me before you go in.”</p><p>But Rio could barely hear Agatha anymore because she’d looked up when she saw someone coming towards them and that someone just so happened to be Agatha’s husband.</p><p>Rio broke her hold of Agatha and smiled widely as Ralph approached. She raised up and kissed his cheek, and managed not to squirm when his large hand hit the small of her back, a little too low for her comfort but not low enough to cause a scene. She felt sick as she passed Agatha on to him but she was a professional, and these thousands of cameras wouldn’t lie if they caught her looking at all annoyed or reluctant.</p><p>“I’ll leave you with your wife,” she said with that same wide smile that felt like a betrayal to her very being.</p><p>But she had no choice.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her side and Rio turned to smile that same false smile at her before she stepped along the carpet and gave Hollywood’s most beautiful couple their space.</p><p>The second Rio was out of Agatha’s hold her chest felt tight again but it was different this time. It wasn’t that she was overwhelmed it was that she was jealous.</p><p>The cameras flashed as she continued to pose, moving every few seconds to make her way along the carpet. In a brief moment of relief between the persistent lights she looked up and caught sight of Jennifer not watching Agatha but watching her instead.</p><p>She looked pensive, almost calm, but the flashing lights meant that Jen was a flickering mirage and the only reality anymore was that Rio was alone on the carpet and ten feet to her left Agatha was tangled up with her husband.</p><p>Rio smiled and posed her way through the rest of the red carpet and soon found her mother’s warm hand back in her own as she left it. Alice was leading them both inside the Dolby Theatre and Rio had to choke down a few breaths just to feel human again. Her dad rubbed her back to soothe her.</p><p>Inside the lobby there were more attendants, more workers desperate to usher the stars and their parties to the right places. There were a few photographers around, and Rio was more aware than usual that her every move was being captured on film.</p><p>She kept her smile up until they found their way to the bar and once up against it Rio released her breath again, closing her eyes to focus her nerves back into the excitement she’d felt earlier.</p><p>“White is a <em>bold</em> choice, Rio Vidal. No red wine for you tonight.”</p><p>Rio turned to the familiar voice and grinned at the sight of Wanda Maximoff gliding over to her with a bright smile. She was in a structured black dress, her red hair swept back into an unfussy updo. She looked at ease, and Rio wondered if when people looked at her they could say the same.</p><p>She hummed as she accepted the delicate press of Wanda’s warm cheek against her own.</p><p>“Well don’t you look beautiful.”</p><p>“Likewise.”</p><p>And Rio meant it when she said it, because Wanda looked incredible in her dress and Rio took a second to appreciate it, and looked up to catch Wanda’s gaze with a now genuinely relaxed smile.</p><p>Wanda twinkled at her as Rio introduced her to her parents and she had to look away when she caught her mom giving her a look that she knew to mean: “what about <em>her</em>, mija?”.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and turned back to the bar to start passing around the champagne.</p><p>“So,” Wanda said conspiratorially, her eyes back on Rio now Anna and Miguel had cornered Alice to ask her more questions about the seating arrangements, “Got your speech?”</p><p>Rio barked a laugh and raised her brows as she gave her own champagne to Wanda and ordered another with a raised hand and a smile at the bartender. “Absolutely not. Alice thinks I’m crazy not to but I pay her to believe in me. <em>You’re</em> just being ridiculous. We both know it’s Agatha’s.”</p><p>“I believe in the power of Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio hummed as she accepted her freshly poured champagne and as she turned to cheers Wanda she saw Agatha enter the bar area and make a beeline for the little group, Jen by her side and Ralph trailing behind.</p><p>Wanda moved a little closer and Rio dropped her gaze from Agatha to glance at the redhead, seeing her tense as she also clocked Agatha Harkness striding over. Rio sighed quietly and bit down on her lip as Agatha stopped just beside Wanda and only just managed to shoot her a tight smile. “Maximoff.”</p><p><em>Maximoff</em>, Rio thought to herself. Agatha had regressed in her acceptance of Wanda.</p><p>“Agatha! You look-…”</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Rio blinked and felt mortified before she just felt… comforted. She nodded, a smile tugging at her lips as she focused on Agatha even as Ralph appeared beside her, his hand curling around her hip possessively.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Wanda and smiled a little, “Nothing. Just… the red carpet was intense.”</p><p>Wanda’s hand reached for her arm and Rio couldn’t help but turn her gaze to Agatha to see how she felt about it. She didn’t look pleased.</p><p>Agatha moved forwards, breaking Ralph’s hold, and slipped in beside Rio to get to the bar. And Rio felt her hand find her own and she had to pretend nothing was happening as she heard Agatha order and their fingers locked together, knuckle to knuckle.</p><p>Agatha’s cape would be a godsend that night. It hid her arm from view, Rio’s now tucked just beneath it too.</p><p>“You’d think you’d be used to it by now,” Ralph was saying opposite. “Though I guess it’s all new to you. I’ve been to, what is it, Agatha? Five of these. Piece of cake, really. Smile, nod, shake hands with the right people, ignore everyone else. Walk in the park.”</p><p>Rio turned to Wanda who was looking like she could smell something unpleasant as she looked up at Ralph. It almost made her laugh out loud.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched and then her hand was dropped as Agatha turned with two new glasses of champagne in her hands. She handed one to Jen and kept the other to herself as she now leant back against the bar and Rio felt her knuckles graze her hip. Though it was Agatha’s left hand against her now - there was no protection.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and in an attempt to change the subject she addressed Wanda: “When did you arrive?”</p><p>“Maybe ten minutes before you. Enough time to drink a shot of-…”</p><p>“Aggie, darling. Forget someone?”</p><p>Rio and Wanda both turned to Ralph and raised their brows and Agatha opened her mouth to say something but Anna Vidal jumped in. “Ralph, perhaps if you want a drink you can always ask.”</p><p>Rio watched as Ralph slapped his trademark grin on his face and placed his arm around her mother. She saw her dad raise his brows at her over her mom’s shoulder and felt Agatha press into her side.</p><p>“I’m a traditionalist, Annie. What can I say.”</p><p>“Anna,” Rio corrected flatly. “And being a traditionalist doesn’t mean-…” She felt Agatha grasp her fingers. She paused briefly and swallowed her words. “I’ll get you a drink.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said firmly, her eyes trained on Ralph, “Ralph, best pick whatever scotch you want. We don’t have long before we have to go in.”</p><p>Anna Vidal smiled knowingly and Rio tugged at Agatha’s hand and made her turn to her. But Wanda spoke first and motioned to Agatha, stealing her attention from where it had been on Rio. “Agatha, who did your styling? It’s insanely good.”</p><p>Rio could have kissed Wanda for trying her best to diffuse the situation but she could only watch as Agatha turned perpendicular to the bar, and something happened that she wasn’t expecting. Agatha had released her hand and had instead moved as she’d turned to grab Rio’s ass.</p><p>The angle Agatha was now at, with her cape draped over her right arm so as to hide where her left had disappeared to, and where Rio’s back was against the bar, it would be impossible to spot.</p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open and she narrowly avoided dribbling the champagne she’d just gone to sip. But Agatha seemed unperturbed and Ralph was squeezing into the bar behind her, oblivious to his wife’s hold on Rio.</p><p>“Looking to steal him?”</p><p>Wanda missed the double meaning.</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened again and she saw a flash of panic in Wanda’s eyes. “C’mon, Agatha,” she managed to get out, “does it look like Wanda needs a new stylist?”</p><p>She motioned to Wanda’s dress and smiled at her, but her mind was on the hand still on her ass, wondering if it were a reaction to Ralph claiming he were in a ‘traditional’ marriage or if it was more about Wanda.</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda laughed, obviously deciding to brush off Agatha’s comment, “You’re just saying that because we’re about to be married and spend four months together.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and hid it badly by taking a sip of her champagne.</p><p>Rio turned to her and smiled serenely, deciding she was in safe waters with Agatha’s secret but possessive hold on her, “Christmas wives.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and didn’t quite meet Rio’s gaze as she squeezed her ass and then pulled her hand away entirely.</p><p><em>Shit.</em></p><p>“Sweet,” Agatha said absently, turning over her shoulder to see if there was an exit strategy available to her which made Rio huff quietly. But she couldn’t reach back out for Agatha to return her hand to her so she remained silent and took another sip of champagne.</p><p>In the rest of the little group her mom was trying her best to speak to Ralph but looked pained as she was doing so. Her dad was watching him with interest and Alice was grinning at something Jen was saying.</p><p>Rio glanced at Wanda and then her mom, unsure who she should rescue first from both of their awkward situations. But she was closer to Wanda and couldn’t abandon her now.</p><p>“I still need to learn my lines,” Rio said casually, trying to salvage what she’d just pushed a little too far.</p><p>“Don’t go slacking on me, Vidal. Can’t show me up in front of Calderu.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes, “Her Majesty will be pleased with me, I promise.”</p><p>“Everybody’s pleased with you.”</p><p>Rio grinned and Agatha pushed off the bar suddenly, leaving her hand on it so when she leant around she was still in contact with Rio. “Should I leave the two of you alone?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened and then she settled and smiled, and Rio thought she was doing a pretty good job of not looking intimidated by the three time nominee and one time winner. So Rio saved her. She moved and placed a hand on Agatha’s hip, “Actually, I should save my mom.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t protest when Rio applied pressure and pushed her back. As Rio brushed past she made eye contact with Agatha and saw her jaw was set, her chin raised, her eyes unreadable.</p><p>But she couldn’t say or do anything to help the situation. So she stepped around her, trusting that Wanda could hold her own for a little while as she got her mom’s attention. And hoping that without herself standing their as bait between the two, Agatha might go a little easier.</p><p>“Mom, we should finish these and go, okay?”</p><p>Anna nodded once, her lips pursed and she said: “Me alegro mucho de no estar al lado de este hombre.” <em>I’m so glad I’m not next to this man.</em></p><p>Rio fought her smile as Ralph raised his brows and looked confused. “Okay so who will be acting as translator tonight? Hon?”</p><p>Rio turned her head and Agatha had moved in closer. Wanda had been caught by Jessica just arriving and for that, Rio was grateful.</p><p>“Lo siento por mi marido, Anna, Miguel. Se cree muy gracioso. Miguel, ¿me acompañas a mi asiento?” <em>I'm sorry for my husband, Anna, Miguel. He thinks he's funny. Miguel, will you walk me to my seat?</em></p><p>Agatha’s voice when she spoke in Spanish was softer somehow, a lower register. And Rio watched her in surprise as she smiled at her dad and moved towards him. Miguel looked taken aback but thrilled to be asked so politely to be escorted by the most famous woman in the building.</p><p>As they linked arms Agatha turned over her shoulder to look at her and for a brief second Rio saw her softening before her eyes. She smiled and Rio smiled back as her dad and her heart moved off together, directed by Alice to a door that would take them to the main theatre.</p><p>“Allow me, senoras?”</p><p>Rio looked around at Ralph and almost laughed at his American sneer on “senoras” but his hand was now on her lower back again and this time she twisted and lightly pushed it away. “If you wouldn’t mind taking my mom? I’ll be right out.”</p><p>Ralph inclined his head, too arrogant or too stupid to be offended by Rio pushing him away. Anna only smiled politely as he offered his arm to her and Rio watched as they left to follow Agatha and Miguel.</p><p>An arm around her waist pulled her attention back even as Alice turned to her with a warning: “Two minutes. Then come through, okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rio grinned as she leant back against Jessica who was turning her into the little group that had gathered.</p><p>She spent five minutes mingling, congratulating everyone on looking so beautiful, exchanging delicate cheek kisses so as not to disturb anyone’s makeup, and gossiping about who might win what.</p><p>But she knew Alice would be stressing. And she knew Agatha would be wondering if she were with Wanda. So she excused herself before she wanted to and walked alone into the theatre.</p><p>Inside the belly of the beast the air felt different, exalted, almost. Beneath the high, curved ceilings, down to the grand stage at the front of the space, rows upon rows of red velvet seats waited for their famous occupiers to arrive. Rio looked up at the balconies that lined the space and saw she was being watched already by their inhabitants.</p><p>She felt small here, a tiny pencil mark to be preserved in the annals of Hollywood history.</p><p>An attendant found her as she began her way down to the front row and he offered his arm to help. She gladly accepted and as they made their way he gushed over her and she felt shy about the attention but glad of the distraction as the filling theatre crowds turned their heads to see one of the Best Actress nominees make her way to her seat.</p><p>The attendant - a wannabe actor named Josh - squeezed Rio’s hand as he arrived with her at the front row and Rio turned to him, kissed his cheek, watched as he blushed an intense red to rival the seats themselves, and smiled as he hurried off to hide his face and tell his coworkers he’d just been kissed by Rio Vidal.</p><p>But Rio now had eyes for her dad who was standing with Agatha, laughing with her. It made her heart swell two sizes too large at the sight.</p><p>“Mija,” Rio turned, her mom smiled where she sat beside Alice. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Es como si no pudiera respirar, mamá.” <em>A little like I can’t breathe, mom.</em></p><p>She didn’t want Ralph, standing nearby, his foot on one of the seats, leaning against his knee to chat to an unamused Jen, to understand what she was saying.</p><p>A hand on her lower back, more welcome and more familiar than Ralph’s had been, told her body to breathe normally again, and Agatha’s voice relaxed her heart. “Estás bien. Eres increíble. Eres Rio Vidal.” <em>You are good. You are incredible. You are Rio Vidal.</em></p><p>Rio turned her head to Agatha, saw her smiling, her brows raised, almost teasing, but definitely reassuring.</p><p>“Mi corazón, tú y Agatha son las personas más bellas, talentosas y merecedoras de este edificio. Deslumbrarán como siempre.” <em>My heart, you and Agatha here, are the most beautiful, most talented, most deserving people in this building. You will dazzle as you always do.</em></p><p>And Agatha moved away to hover near Anna as her dad moved in to pull Rio into a tight embrace. “Te quiero. Respira hondo y toma la mano de tu mamá.” <em>I love you. Take deep breaths and hold your mom’s hand.</em></p><p>Rio smiled sadly, suddenly overwhelmed with regret that she hadn’t managed to get a seat for her dad in their row. But she kissed his cheek firmly, squeezing his arm as she did. “I love you.”</p><p>He smiled at her one last time, a great, big, proud smile, and then turned to kiss his wife, and disappeared off to find an attendant to take him to his seat.</p><p>The lights flashed and Rio turned from watching her dad disappear to see the rest of their odd little grouping begin to move to their correct positions. In the rush Agatha moved again to squeeze her side and Rio whispered to her: “Thank you for including him.”</p><p>“I like him,” Agatha said as she paused before her, her eyes darting about to check they weren’t being overheard before she focused in on Rio, “I like your family.”</p><p>Rio nodded and knew Agatha wasn’t lying. She smiled a little and watched as Agatha’s soft expression fell into something more mournful and she murmured, “I’ll find you when this is all over.”</p><p>“You’d better.”</p><p>Rio flashed a grin at her as she saw a photographer appear nearby and Agatha must have noticed him too because she pulled her hand away and turned to sit down. The last touch of Agatha Harkness was stolen from her because they were still a secret, still a thing to be hidden.</p><p>And Rio’s nerves morphed into nausea once more as she took her seat beside her mother.</p><p>She could barely register Wanda’s brother taking his seat beside her, was barely able to acknowledge his introduction and Wanda’s warm smiles. Because Agatha was the other side of her mom, but too far still, always too far.</p><p>The loud room was silenced just as Rio finally began to ease her racing heart. Her mom held her hand and that movement seemed to signal to the universe that Rio Vidal was ready to begin.</p><p>The lights dimmed and an eerie hush swept through the theatre. The cameras circled and the lights on stage twinkled their magic as the great curtains swept up and with a collective intake of breath and the swell of the orchestra, the show began.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were alert and wide as she watched it all unfold with a slick precision that was hard to miss in the live broadcast and easy to see from the front row.</p><p>The faint movements of the technical team behind the stage caught her eye every so often and she knew she shared with them the same nervous energy that made her grip her mom’s hand tighter with every passing second.</p><p>Every category was a reason to release some of that energy. She clapped and cheered with the room as she witnessed dreams come true and speeches that had only ever been delivered before to shampoo bottles and steamed up bathroom mirrors.</p><p>And then it was time for her category and she felt a shift in the theatre. The cameras were circling around and Rio felt herself tense as she locked her smile on her face.</p><p>Her mom moved beside her and Rio was glad of the excuse to look because she couldn’t stand the pomp and ceremony when it was focused on her. Her hand was being moved into the middle of her mom’s lap and Anna was reaching too for Agatha’s.</p><p>As Agatha turned to see she locked eyes with Rio and they exchanged grins as they both realised what Anna Vidal was doing.</p><p>She’d captured them both in her two hands and brought them together in her lap, allowing her hold to release and for Agatha to reach for Rio, and for Rio to do the same. Rio held Agatha’s hand like her life depended on never letting go and she turned to the stage as she felt her mom cradle their hands together, giving them at least some semblance of privacy as they were broadcast to the world.</p><p>Rio’s name was read out, a small speech given about her performance, about her confidence and ease on screen, a round of applause for her nomination. Agatha’s was read next. She was lauded for her captivating screen presence, for her dedication to her craft, for her generational talent. The room erupted for her too.</p><p>And then, when everyone nominated had heard their names and received with them the praises due a group of Best Actress nominees, all eyes fell to the golden envelope in the presenter’s hands.</p><p>The sound of it being opened was somehow magnified ten times over in the silence of the room.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened impossibly around Rio’s. Her mom squeezed them both.</p><p>“And the Oscar for Best Actress goes to…!”</p><p>Rio bit her lip.</p>

<h4>2021 | Alice &amp; Rio’s Apartment</h4><p><em>“Rio!”</em></p><p><em>“God, fuck! In a minute! I burnt the fucking-…”</em></p><p><em>“Jesus, Rio, you’ll miss it!”</em></p><p><em>Rio growled and threw the bag of piping hot popcorn onto the counter. The kernels burst from it like a buttery fireworks display and Rio growled again but turned her back on the mess to rush through to the living room where her friends were gathered on the tiny, uncomfortable couch and the floor in front of it.</em></p><p><em>“It’s insane to me that she’s a real person. Like, living, breathing, you know?”</em></p><p><em>Rio huffed again as she squeezed in between Alice and Wanda and moved one of the flat cushions to cradle in her lap.</em></p><p><em>“Popcorn’s burnt.”</em></p><p><em>“You tried your best,” Wanda reassured as Alice laughed, “We have beer. Don’t worry about it.”</em></p><p><em>Rio grumbled a little and wriggled to try and steal more space but was unsuccessful in her attempts as Alice nudged her elbow sharply into her ribs.</em></p><p><em>“Shh,” Carol hushed urgently, flapping her hand from where she sat on the floor. “They’re announcing it.”</em></p><p><em>Rio scowled as she reached over for her now-warm beer and settled back again to focus on the tiny television screen in the tiny apartment she shared with Alice.</em></p><p><em>The picture now showed five previous Best Actress winners all standing in a semi-circle on the stage. They all, in their own ways, looked glamorous, beautiful, confident. To Rio they were goddess of stage and screen and she’d seen their work more times than she could count.</em></p><p><em>Though, admittedly, she thought one of the group was overrated. But no one else agreed so she often just kept that opinion to herself.</em></p><p><em>This way of announcing the nominees and eventual winner was new, had only been done once before, and Rio felt it was a little too schmaltzy.</em></p><p><em>Each were taking it in turns to reel off some spiel about the nominee they’d been assigned to publicly compliment. And Rio leant forwards in her seat, feeling Wanda’s hand rub her mid-back, as the esoteric Lilia Calderu filled the screen.</em></p><p><em>“Agatha Harkness!” She announced, smiling indulgently as the Dolby Theatre erupted in applause.</em></p><p><em>The favourite to win. Rio’s favourite ever.</em></p><p><em>“If she doesn’t win, I’ll-…” Alice started but stopped immediately when Rio and Carol shushed her again.</em></p><p><em>“Your power knows no bounds,” Lilia continued, twinkling from the stage down at where Agatha must be sitting in the front row.</em></p><p><em>“Your understanding and control of the craft is a gift to us all.”</em></p><p><em>And suddenly the picture on screen changed and Agatha Harkness was there in all her glory. Rio bit down on her lip, felt Alice beside her lean forwards a little too.</em></p><p><em>Agatha was smiling, she looked modest, touched. The crowd around her was applauding Lilia’s words, confirming them to the world.</em></p><p><em>“She’s so fucking hot,” Alice muttered as Lilia continued and the camera stayed focused on Agatha.</em></p><p><em>“Your performance in ‘The Concert Pianist’ was nothing short of extraordinary, my dear. And you are extraordinary in everything you do.”</em></p><p><em>Agatha inclined her head and Rio dropped her gaze to her lower lip that was now pulled between her teeth. She’d seen that lip up close, almost felt it against her own four years ago now.</em></p><p><em>“You truly are the best of us,” Lilia continued and the theatre erupted again to confirm what everybody already knew: Agatha was the best.</em></p><p><em>“I’m so in love with her,” Carol said absently and Rio kicked her gently in the side, her eyes still trained on Agatha’s face as she beamed up at the stage before the camera moved to the next presenter.</em></p><p><em>“My culture is not your costume.”</em></p><p><em>“Oh, come on. Everyone’s in love with her. She doesn’t belong to you, Rio.”</em></p><p><em>Rio sipped her beer and muttered, “I wish.”</em></p><p><em>She felt Wanda’s hand move against her back and she relaxed a little, but kept her eyes on the screen as the showcase of each actress came to an end.</em></p><p><em>The main presenter appeared back on the screen and little boxes of each nominee appeared beside her, Agatha in the top most right hand side. She looked calm, a smile only just tugging at her lips, and Rio wondered if she actually felt it or if her heart was thudding as loudly in her ears as Rio’s currently was.</em></p><p><em>“And the Oscar for Best Actress goes to…!”</em></p><p><em>The four women in Rio and Alice’s little living room all inhaled sharply as the presenter slipped open the golden envelope.</em></p><p><em>Rio leant forwards.</em></p><p><em>“Agatha Harkness!”</em></p><p><em>Alice cheered and leapt to her feet beside her and Rio grinned at the tv, swerving away from Alice’s legs to get a shot of Agatha as she rose to her feet. She watched as she kissed the man she knew to be her husband and felt a jolt of something in her chest as she turned her head from his and accepted only the briefest of cheek kisses before she was in the arms of her director.</em></p><p><em>Rio laughed as Carol pushed and pulled at her knees and she placed her beer down onto the safety of the coffee table before she looked back up and watched now as Agatha climbed her way up to the stage, her red dress billowing out behind her as she did.</em></p><p><em>“Jesus she’s unreal,” Rio breathed out, and wasn’t aware of it but Wanda had pulled her hand away.</em></p><p><em>“Imagine how fucking lucky her husband feels. He’s such a dick. He stood on my foot at that mixer we went to last fall,” Alice said as she stole Rio’s beer and sat back down again. “I like her manager though. Mean in a sexy-…”</em></p><p><em>“Alice. Shut up.”</em></p><p><em>Agatha was now at the microphone, holding her new Oscar in both hands. As the camera zoomed in Rio noticed her blue eyes shining with unshed tears and she wondered how anyone got anything done with Agatha looking like that anywhere near them.</em></p><p><em>Even seeing her across the room at parties she felt struck dumb by her. And any time she’d felt like they’d locked eyes she’d almost collapsed on the spot.</em></p><p><em>“You really know how to make a gal feel special.” Agatha laughed modestly, taking a second to look out over the crowd of people on their feet for her.</em></p><p><em>Carol shuffled over and leant her elbow on Rio’s leg.</em></p><p><em>“I wouldn’t be here tonight without my incredible cast and crew. With all of your hard work and dedication to this little movie. I’m in awe of all of you.”</em></p><p><em>“She’s not in awe of anyone,” Alice scoffed, “she’s-…”</em></p><p><em>“Shut up!”</em></p><p><em>“I’d like to thank The Academy for recognising this movie that meant so much to us as we were making it. My fellow nominees who…”</em></p><p><em>Rio chewed on her lip and placed her hand on Carol’s shoulder.</em></p><p><em>“… you’re just a dream to be around. Thank you for making this experience so magical for me.”</em></p><p><em>Agatha looked down at the Oscar as the applause washed over the audience.</em></p><p><em>“To my husband…” she looked up again, and looked out to the crowd where the camera switched to a view of Ralph. He had a big grin on his face and Rio felt irrationally angry about someone so handsome. “I have no words.”</em></p><p><em>“If I were married to Agatha Harkness-…” Alice started and Rio shushed her again, stealing her beer back.</em></p><p><em>“Performing is something I’ve done my whole life. I live and breathe this craft and it means everything to me that I’m standing up here tonight.”</em></p><p><em>The crowd erupted and Rio shifted forwards a little, wondering why Agatha looked more emotional talking about her craft than her husband.</em></p><p><em>“I share this with my manager, Jen, who has been by my side since college. And everyone who sees themselves up there on the screen, or on the stage. Anyone who shares my dreams.”</em></p><p><em>The crowd applauded again and Agatha smiled, a dazzling, watery smile that made Rio’s stomach flip.</em></p><p><em>“Finally, before I go, if I may, I’d like to dedicate this to the love of my life, my son, Nicky. Honey, mama loves you beyond life itself. To the moon and all the farthest stars. I can’t wait to squeeze you so tight when I get home. Thank you.”</em></p><p><em>She raised the Oscar and nodded her last thanks to the crowd before she strode away to more earth-shattering applause.</em></p><p><em>The four women in the little apartment were silent for a while, watching Agatha Harkness as she was ushered from the stage. It was Rio who broke the spell eventually: “I actually might be in love with her.”</em></p><p><em>Alice laughed and Rio looked down as Carol smiled up at her, “I’m afraid she would never be interested. Did you see how handsome her husband is?”</em></p><p><em>“Yeah but he’s an ass,” Alice added in Rio’s defence. “Rio’s only a dick.”</em></p><p><em>“Great, thank you.”</em></p><p><em>“I think you’d stand more of a chance with her mean manager,” Wanda said with a grin, “I hear she’s on our team.”</em></p><p><em>“Hello what now?” Alice was suddenly back on the couch, eyes wide as she leant around Rio to get to Wanda.</em></p><p><em>Rio laughed and shoved Alice off of her and reconfirmed in her own mind what she had been suspecting since the moment she’d shared with Agatha in the bathroom: that maybe she stood a slim chance with Agatha. And the other thing she was now sure of, more so than anything before in her life, was that if she won an Oscar and the person she loved were in the audience, she’d have plenty of words for <strong>her</strong>.</em></p><p> </p><h4>2025 | The Dolby Theatre</h4><p>“And the Oscar for Best Actress goes to…!”</p><p>The room was still, silent.</p><p>And all Rio could feel was her heartbeat so loud in her ears and the intense, steady pressure of Agatha’s fingers wrapped tightly around her own.</p><p>She knew that three rows back from her, deep into the tangle of bodies in plush red chairs, that Alice would be leaning forwards in her seat, her own hand probably crushing the life out of her dad’s.</p><p>She could picture the people at home all placing their bets on whether it would be Agatha Harkness or Rio Vidal who would take home the trophy. She imagined their snacks laid out before them, the cool beer in their hands, the soft pyjamas they probably wore.</p><p>She wanted to be them. Wanted to be watching this from afar, undetached, unimpacted by whatever name was read out from the little gold envelope before her.</p><p>But she was here. She was clutching the hand of the woman she loved. The eyes of the world were on them but their touch was just for them.</p><p>Her mom squeezed her hand, Agatha’s fingers twitched.</p><p>She sucked in a breath.</p><p>“Rio Vidal!”</p><p>Rio’s body went rigid, petrified by the shock. And the fingers that once clutched at Agatha were ripped open as Agatha and her mom moved.</p><p>Anna leant over the armrest and pulled her daughter into a hold so tight that it shocked Rio back into her body. She was breathing again, but stiff still, her eyes wide and her mouth hanging open.</p><p>She rose slowly from her seat, helped by the hands of those people who had run over to get to her. But one pair of hands disregarded the rest and pulled Rio into a hold so tight she lost her breath again.</p><p>“Agatha,” she whispered without knowing really what else to say. But she held on tight, ignoring the other hands that tried to pull her to them and from <em>her</em>.</p><p>“You have to go, Rio. You have to go.”</p><p>Agatha released her hold, loosening without letting go, and Rio stared wide-eyed at her, unsure why tears were forming in bright blue eyes. She reached for her cheek and Agatha smiled, let her do it, whispered the words: “Rio. Baby.”</p><p>A pair of lips found her right arm and Rio turned to see Wanda beaming at her as Agatha began to push at her waist, directing her away from the small crowd that had formed and up to the stage. Wanda managed to kiss her cheek too and Rio smiled absently at her, realising she was beginning to cry too as the familiar feel of Agatha’s hands on her fell away.</p><p>Two men darted out to help her up the stairs and Rio turned naturally to her right to accept the help of Wanda’s brother rather than the alternative option of Ralph Bohner.</p><p>She smiled at the man whose name she’d already forgotten and clung to him until she was at the top of the stairs and able to make her way over to the Oscar that was now hers.</p><p>The presenter squeezed her and kissed her cheek and she turned to her waiting audience.</p><p>The room was on its feet, all still applauding, some cheering. And Rio had seen this before but only through the lens of the television, only when she was one of the masses in their pyjamas, watching the glamorous, unreal famous people accept their golden statues.</p><p>But down in the first row were the people who grounded her. Anna and Agatha now stood, arm in arm, both grinning up at her, one openly crying, the other just about holding it in.</p><p>“Dios mío,” Rio began, unconsciously slipping into her mother tongue as she stared down at Anna and Agatha. Her brow furrowed in confusion as a tear slipped from her eye. It seemed unfair suddenly that she’d been given this award and yet had no say in where she stood. Because she wanted to be where they were. She wanted to be wrapped up in them.</p><p>“No sé.” <em>I don’t understand</em>. She tried again, her gaze now locked into watery blue eyes as they shone up at her. But Agatha was nodding, encouraging her, and she winked as her smile widened and Rio released a laugh, halfway between relief and disbelief.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a second and turned back to the audience still on their feet for her. “This is… too much for one person to handle.”</p><p>She felt rather than heard the ripple of laughter through the theatre and took a breath as she reminded herself that this was her one shot at it. That this most likely wouldn’t happen again.</p><p>“Mi primer agradecimiento se lo prometí hace mucho tiempo a alguien a quien he amado durante años.” <em>My first thank you I promised long ago to someone I have loved for years now.</em></p><p><em>Love.</em> not <em>in love</em>. She couldn’t say it.</p><p>Rio knew most wouldn’t understand her, some would be annoyed she was speaking Spanish rather than the traditional English, but she couldn’t help it. Her speech would be translated and dissected over and over again anyway.</p><p>This felt most natural. It felt most herself.</p><p>She took a breath and turned back to Agatha, her arm no longer looped with her mother’s but instead around her shoulders, holding her as she cried.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio smiled around her name, watched as Agatha smiled at the sound of it too, her free hand moving to her diaphragm as if to steady her breathing, “You’re the best person, the best actress, the best mother. I…” and she felt the words choke her, felt how they swelled in her throat, how they prevented her from saying any more.</p><p>She’d made a promise years ago that she would tell the woman she loved how much she loved her, if she were lucky enough to have a woman to love. And she was. She had her. But only secretly. Only in the dark. So she settled for choking on her words instead, letting them dissolve in her throat and settle heavily in her chest.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to shake them away as she dropped her gaze to the award in her hands and let the applause for Agatha speak for her instead.</p><p>“And to the other best mother in my life,” she raised her gaze to her mom and grinned at her, laughing as she saw Anna shake her head at her and wipe quickly at her eyes, knowing as she did that she was on camera.</p><p>The crowd laughed with Rio as she took a second to steady and swallow down again the words that had almost escaped her earlier.</p><p>“Te amo. Tú y papá me habéis enseñado a amar y a ser amado. Y estoy aquí hoy gracias a ti. Te amo, mamá. Te amo, papá.” <em>I love you. You and dad have shown me how to love and how to be loved. And I am here today because of you. I love you, mom. I love you, dad.</em></p><p>Through the applause again she heard a whistle and she looked up in the direction it came from. Her dad’s whistle. One she’d heard a million times before when she was on a generational run across the basketball court, when she was streaking ahead during track, when she was taking a bow at curtain call.</p><p>She grinned so hard she laughed again. “Thanks, dad.”</p><p>The crowd laughed with her and Rio knew she had them in her clutches, that for one brief moment in time the whole world was under her spell.</p><p>She took another breath and let herself take it all in, needing a second to calm her racing heart.</p><p>“I don’t accept this lightly. I know what a huge honour it is to even be amongst you all tonight. And I’m so grateful to be here. So hugely in awe of everyone. So thrilled to be here with my fellow nominees.”</p><p>More applause. Some hollering.</p><p>“Wanda, Jessica, Isla, Sylvia, and Agatha. All of you… it’s incredible to me I’m even considered worthy of being here amongst you.”</p><p>More clapping. She looked up and saw Agatha was frozen in place, the pale hand on her front now twisted in the velvet.</p><p>“My beautiful cast and crew, I love you all so much. I share this with you. I wouldn’t <em>be</em> here without your talent and support and joy.”</p><p>She tried to find them in the crowd but could only see the faceless masses and Agatha down at the front, still clutching her dress, still holding her mom, still beaming her teary grin up at Rio.</p><p>“I really should go before I say anything that’ll get me in trouble.” <em>Not a lie.</em></p><p>Laughter. Her mom shaking her head again.</p><p>“Thank you for this. Thank you to the Academy. Really. I’m… speechless, thank you. Te veo.”</p><p>She held her award up and grinned at her audience and then turned to leave the stage.</p><p>Rio Vidal didn’t breathe again until Alice found her. She was aware she was being taken somewhere, aware there was a camera in her face, aware people were brushing her arms as she went past and smiling their congrats at her but she couldn’t take any of it in.</p><p>She smiled and nodded and grinned and laughed but she felt separate from it, so out of her mind with disbelief that she couldn’t feel her own body.</p><p>Only when a familiar touch grabbed her side and she was turned into the arms of her best friend did she understand what had happened.</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“No, Rio. Holy shit.”</p><p>“I’m going to have a panic attack.”</p><p>Alice pulled back with wide eyes and her tear-stained face and she held Rio firmly in front of her, nodding quickly as she assessed the promise in Rio’s words.</p><p>“Breathe with me,” she urged, taking in slow, obvious breaths so Rio could follow along. She did so and found her chest loosening after a while, her body giving into the adrenaline coursing through her veins as it quivered occasionally on Alice’s hold.</p><p>When Rio felt more in control she nodded and Alice pulled her back in for a hug and Rio was grateful she wasn’t making her keep to a tight schedule for once in their working relationship. She just held her, let Rio breathe against her, let her recover.</p><p>Rio pulled away only when she knew she could handle it and smiled dazedly down at Alice who still looked concerned. “Can you believe it?”</p><p>“Babe, I’ve believed it since we started this whole thing.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and raised her arm to wipe away the lipstick on Alice’s face but Alice moved before she could and lifted her right arm to rub away the lipstick that Rio had on her.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>Alice laughed then, and it took over her completely. She almost bent double and Rio caught the laughter too and dissolved into it as if she hadn’t just been having a total crisis in her best friend’s arms.</p><p>They recovered together and moved together to the press rooms where Rio was applauded upon entering and cheered when she held her new trophy up for the world’s press to see.</p><p>“Rio! Congratulations!”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said with a laugh as she tried to find which of the press was now talking to her.</p><p>“Over here.” A man waved and she turned to him with a nod.</p><p>“Hello!”</p><p>“Hi. Your speech, was it a conscious decision to speak in Spanish?”</p><p>“Are you consciously speaking in English right now?”</p><p>There was a smattering of laughter and Rio smiled as she was directed to the next question.</p><p>“Congrats, Rio. Did you have any idea of the way tonight would go?”</p><p>“God, no. I thought it was Agatha’s all along.”</p><p>She turned to the next and smiled as she was congratulated again.</p><p>“You thanked Agatha first in your speech. We’ve had the translation through now. Do you consider her a mentor of sorts?”</p><p>And Rio laughed because what would Agatha say to this?</p><p>“A friend, first. But… I do look up to her, obviously. She’s twice the actor I’ll ever be.”</p><p>Another, and then another, and another, and Rio soon lost track of how many questions she’d answered. But they were all relatively innocuous, and she got away with mostly smiling and nodding and giving one-line sound bites for each publication and channel.</p><p>Alice was soon ushering from from the makeshift stage again and she left the room to more applause and soon found herself in another corridor where Jasmine her makeup artist was waiting to touch her up and make her photograph ready.</p><p>When her lipstick had been reapplied and her hair adjusted she was taken to pose with her fellow winners. The weight of the golden statue in her hand began to feel normal, began to almost anchor her down to the ground where she was still in danger of floating off into the clouds.</p><p>“Is that it? Please tell me I can get drunk now.”</p><p>Alice laughed as she pushed Rio along through another crowded area full of flashing cameras and people jostling for Rio’s attention.</p><p>“We gotta get the statue engraved, babe. Make it official.”</p><p>Rio pretended to be annoyed by this but really her name on an Academy Award was something she’d dreamt of since she was old enough to have dreams. So she grinned widely and made no more complaint as an attendant, after congratulating Rio profusely, took her over to the little area where there were hoards of other winners looking to get their metal made official.</p><p>Rio sidled up to the handsome Best Supporting Actor and exchanged comfortable small talk with him as she was handed a glass of champagne and photographed from every possible angle. She was so pleased, in that moment, that Alice had insisted Jasmine tag along with them that night.</p><p>But soon the award was back in her hands and now, amongst the details of the award, it read: RIO VIDAL.</p><p>“Holy fucking shit.”</p><p>She mingled some more, Alice telling her to relax and finish her champagne which she did in record time because she needed it and because she was desperate to see her parents and to get through all of this so she could find Agatha again.</p><p>Alice helped to extract her once she was done. She’d done her job and she’d done it well so she relaxed now and her grin became more soft as she swung her golden man through the hallways. That was, until Alice broke the bad news that the next room she was taking her to she’d need to be on her best behaviour for.</p><p>“A couple big journos, okay? Actually, there’s a third one and she’s a <em>nightmare</em>. But nothing you can’t handle.”</p><p>“Jesus. What? I thought I was done with the press.”</p><p>Alice sighed heavily and as they stopped outside the door she turned to Rio and held her arms, “You’ve got this. I believe in you, remember. Big deep breaths.”</p><p>Rio nodded and forced a smile, forcing it to turn into a grin wide enough to hide her fear.</p><p>Alice smiled back at her and turned to open the door. But she didn’t walk in first like she usually would to announce Rio’s arrival. She instead pushed it and held it and stepped aside for Rio to go in before her.</p><p>But Rio didn’t move. Because standing inside the little room were three of her favourite people.</p><p>Anna, Miguel, and Agatha.</p><p>“You bitch,” she muttered for Alice’s ears only but her best friend simply beamed at her and ushered her in.</p><p>“You have ten minutes. Go!”</p><p>Rio laughed as she made quick strides to launch herself at her dad, finding her mom’s arms around her almost immediately too. She cried in between them, felt her dad brushing down her hair and her mom rubbing her back.</p><p>“Nosotras estamos muy orgullosas de ti.” <em>We are so proud of you.</em></p><p>Rio felt her mom grip her harder and she released a shaky laugh as she lifted her head to look at them both and grinned through their tears.</p><p>Alice didn’t even pull Rio away when Anna kissed over her daughter’s face.</p><p>Rio laughed again as she moved back and looked up to see the third person who’d been waiting for her. Agatha stood quietly off to the side, a faint smile on her face as she watched the reunion, her left hand clutching her right arm.</p><p>She looked shy, like she’d stumbled into something she shouldn’t be part of. But Rio wanted her here, she <em>had</em> to know Rio wanted her here.</p><p>“Ve a abrazarla.” <em>Go hug her.</em></p><p>Anna pushed her daughter towards Agatha. But Rio didn’t really need the encouragement. She practically stumbled her way to her and paused when she was directly in front of her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes looked glassy and Rio lost her train of thought for a second as she stared into them.</p><p>Neither of them moved.</p><p>“Did you schedule in this meeting? I’m an Oscar winner now. Very important. Very busy.”</p><p>Agatha smirked at her. “Alice gave me a special pass for tonight, superstar.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>Rio bit on her lip to hide her own smirk and turned to look over her shoulder at her parents, shooting Alice a look too. “Could we have a second?”</p><p>She watched as they all turned, her dad not without a squeeze of her arm, and left them to it.</p><p>Anna was the last to leave and had corralled the others before her and Rio turned back to Agatha missing her mom watching her for a second before she finally closed the door behind her.</p><p>“A special pass?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, her gaze moved slowly down her right arm, seemed to linger there for a second, then dropped to the Oscar hanging from Rio’s right hand. “It’s actually a lifetime pass.”</p><p>“Lifetime, huh? Seems… official.”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly as blue eyes flashed back up to meet her own and Agatha grinned at her, teasing and wicked.</p><p>“We only have five minutes, Rio.”</p><p>“You just said a lifetime.”</p><p>Agatha laughed as Rio grinned. Agatha stepped forwards and Rio raised her chin as pale hands slid to hold her head, her thumbs brushing tenderly over her cheeks.</p><p>“How do you feel?”</p><p>“A little drunk, weirdly. A little emotional. Very surprised.”</p><p>“You deserve it.”</p><p>“I do?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“You’re not…” Rio grinned, watching as Agatha’s gaze honed in on her smile. “Jealous?”</p><p>“I’ll let you have this one. There are plenty more for me to win.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha continued her movements against her cheeks. Her words were teasing but her face was soft and as Rio’s laughter died down she breathed in slowly, the soft scent of familiar perfume relaxing her even as her body quivered from the excess adrenaline still coursing through her.</p><p>“I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little as she leant in to kiss Rio, capturing her lower lip and making Rio whimper quietly and it took her a second to get her brain in gear to be able to kiss Agatha back.</p><p>When Agatha pulled away she dropped her hands from her face and moved the cape part of her dress to wrap around Rio and they tangled themselves together, with Rio’s shining Oscar resting now against Agatha’s back.</p><p>“Your mom has been crying since you won.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was soft and low against her ear and Rio smiled and turned her head into her more, blinking owlishly as she rested her forehead against Agatha’s. She took a deep breath.</p><p>“You looked pretty teary yourself from where I was standing.”</p><p>“You wish,” Agatha said with a grin as she angled up to kiss Rio. It was delicate, unassuming, and finished too quickly. But Rio smiled all the same as Agatha leant in again to kiss the corner of her smile, to press her nose in against Rio’s warm cheek.</p><p>“Did you like my speech?” Rio asked quietly, feeling her heart rate slow to a steady pace again in Agatha’s hold.</p><p>Agatha nodded against her, placing a kiss to her cheek before she pulled away to meet Rio’s gaze, “You looked incredible up there.”</p><p>Rio smiled and squeezed Agatha’s waist, moving her hand back to brush over the soft velvet against her hip. “It should have been yours.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and pressed her face in against Rio’s cheek again, falling into silence for a few seconds before she whispered, “It was always going to be yours. I <em>wanted</em> you to get it. Enjoy it.”</p><p>“And you’ll get the next one?”</p><p>“Oh, honey. I said enjoy it. Not get used to it.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha grinned against her cheek, “I mean it.”</p><p>Rio exhaled a laugh and pulled back, finding it difficult with how tight Agatha’s hold was on her. “You can’t threaten an Oscar winner.”</p><p>“I have a special pass, remember?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and held up her Oscar, moving it between them and beaming up at Agatha. “He’s handsome.”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“Never been attracted to a man before.”</p><p>Agatha moved her arms down Rio’s body, linking her fingers over the small of Rio’s back where their hips pressed together.</p><p>“Has winning an Oscar awoken something in you that I won’t like?”</p><p>“I’m still a one woman gal, if that’s what you’re worried about.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and maintained eye contact with Rio as she leant in and kiss the statue on his back. “Then I’m okay with him.”</p><p>“Rio! We’re coming in!”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, the spell of Agatha’s gaze broken as the reality of where they were crashed down around her. Agatha pulled back and Rio smiled sadly as Agatha kissed her cheek quickly and then took a step back and brushed down her dress.</p><p>“Smooth,” Rio mouthed across at her and received a smirk in response just as the door opened again and Rio turned to greet her adoring parents.</p><p>She felt a hand on her side and a body briefly press against hers from behind as Agatha leant in to kiss her cheek again and Rio grinned because of it. “I’ll see you soon.”</p><p>She watched her leave, pausing briefly to hug her mom and kiss her dad before she hit the door, turned to smile briefly in Rio’s direction, and then left.</p><p>Rio felt like she’d taken her heart with her.</p><p>“Vidal!” Alice called, clapping her hands in front of Rio’s face to get her to snap out of it.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled at her friend. “Yes. Ready. Let’s go.”</p><p>“Umm,” Alice said quickly, holding her hand up as she turned to shout for Jasmine.</p><p>“Really, Alice? We’re only going to the car.” Anna moved in to brush her thumbs over Rio’s cheeks and smile at her daughter. Rio huffed a little but closed her eyes as her mom began to fix her face until Jasmine could work her magic again.</p><p>“Lots of tears, huh?” Jasmine said with a grin. “Agatha didn’t look so polished either when she walked past just there.”</p><p>Rio’s lips were being repainted so she couldn’t say anything but she caught her mom giving her dad a look and Rio knew what that look meant. It meant that she might be the Best Actress but she was a lousy liar.</p><p>Perhaps it was inevitable, she thought, her desire to be with Agatha was growing stronger and stronger each day and she was hopeful that Agatha felt the same. They were bound to show themselves to people in one way or another. And maybe that’s why Jen was getting so demonstrably frightened.</p><p>When Rio was back to camera ready she took her mom’s hand and followed Alice out to join the fray again. She expected to see Agatha somewhere close but all she got instead were familiar but unknown faces congratulating her and pulling her into hugs.</p><p>She smiled through it, searching for Agatha or Wanda or Jennifer or Jessica or even Lilia. But she supposed those with any sense, or at least with good teams around them, would have snuck out first to get back to their hotels to change and prep for the after parties.</p><p>Once free of grabbing hands, the little group piled into the waiting SUV and Rio breathed out in relief, closing her eyes as she relaxed back into the leather and handed over her Oscar to Alice to inspect.</p><p>“Academy Award to Rio Vidal. Best performance by an actress in a leading role. <em>All The Wrong Gods</em>. 2025. Holy shit.”</p><p>Miguel laughed and stole the Oscar from Alice to inspect it himself.</p><p>“How much do you think I could make for that on eBay?”</p><p>“Don’t even joke about that.”</p><p>Rio grinned and felt her mom squeeze her hand and a soft whisper in her ear as Alice started to babble to her dad about what this would <em>actually</em> mean for Rio’s career.</p><p>“¿Ella no está contenta con Ralph?” <em>She isn’t happy with Ralph?</em></p><p>Rio turned slowly to her mom and frowned a little as she studied her soft expression. “No. She’s not.”</p><p>Anna nodded and squeezed Rio’s hand. Rio watched as she looked down for a second and then said, but didn’t look up to meet Rio’s gaze again, “Ella estaba ansiosa por verte.” <em>She was anxious to see you.</em></p><p>“Mamá.” Rio shifted a little.</p><p>But in a way only a mother could Anna silenced Rio without having to say anything. She squeezed Rio’s hand and lifted her chin to look at her properly and smiled with the warmth every mother should have reserved only for their child. Rio knew she didn’t have to say anything, knew her mom would never ask her to, and would always be there regardless.</p><p>Anna and Rio returned to the other conversation being held in the car after their little moment of mutual understanding. And Rio found that she picked up everything Miguel put down for her with her usual enthusiasm and a growing sense of excitement that she would soon be in a party where everyone would know her name but only a few could get close.</p><p>Agatha closest of all.</p><p>It wasn’t long before the vocal group made it to the hotel room Alice had arranged for them to hunker down in and get Rio into her party best.</p><p>But it turned out no one wanted to do their jobs.</p><p>Rio was greeted by her glam squad and a million balloons and streamers. A surprise edition of Beyoncé topped off the party atmosphere as the soundtrack of choice and Alice could not make anyone lock in even though she tried her hardest to be as stern as she possibly could.</p><p>But Rio wrestled her down - just not literally this time.</p><p>And with Alice eventually on side the squad, the parents, the manager, and the actress, all danced about the room celebrating what Rio insisted was - and they all secretly thought to be - their joint success.</p><p>The party lasted the length of three bottles of Veuve and when the last glass was finished the work finally began.</p><p>Rio was taken into the bedroom and stripped of her custom Versace and placed into another custom Versace number. Only this time, rather than the off-white of her first dress, she was now in the exact opposite kind of gown.</p><p>This dress had been a collaboration with Versace, a dress created for and with Rio. It was designed to show off her body but it was more than that: it was made to show off her spirit.</p><p>The dress was a vivid red, commanding and eye-catching. It clung to her like the marble veil of a Grecian statue. One side swept up to a strap over her shoulder, leaving the other bare, choosing to defy symmetry.</p><p>There was a daring cutout along her torso on her right side showing off her abs in a window of smooth tanned skin. The skirt fell straight to the floor except for a slit up to her thigh that would turn each of her steps into a show.</p><p>“Holy shit,” was Alice’s response when Rio appeared back in the living room to the sounds of the fourth bottle popping.</p><p>“Was the slit always that big?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Rio laughed as her mom came over in her own new outfit to inspect her and muttered something about her daughter being all grown up. “¿Te gusta, mamá?”</p><p>“Sentirás frío.” <em>You will be cold.</em></p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but her mom leant up to kiss her cheek and smiled, “You look beautiful. You take after me.”</p><p>And Miguel laughed as he moved over to kiss Rio’s other cheek, “Sí, eres tan hermosa como tu mamá.” <em>Yes, just as beautiful as your mom.</em></p><p>Rio grinned and gave both her parents a hug before she turned to Alice who was once again tapping away at her iPhone.</p><p>“Alice. It’s party time. C’mon.”</p><p>“Unfortunately for me I’m now managing an Oscar winning actress which is so much more-…” Rio snatched her phone, held it high in the air and smiled as Alice scowled at her.</p><p>“Work can wait. Just be here with me and celebrate, okay?”</p><p>“I’d smack you if your parents weren’t here.”</p><p>Miguel leant around his daughter and grinned, “Smack away.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and shoved her dad away as she handed the phone back. “Really. Relax, please. Work can begin tomorrow.”</p><p>Alice took her phone back and, because she knew Miguel might have allowed a little slap to Rio’s arm to happen but Anna never would, she waited until they were both looking away before she slapped Rio’s arm and muttered, “So ungrateful.”</p><p>Rio snickered and placed a red-lipped kiss to Alice’s cheek, admiring the signature she’d left with a grin, “We won, Alice.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> won, you idiot.”</p><p>Rio’s grin softened and she shook her head and took Alice’s hand. “Let’s go.”</p><p>As she pulled Alice to the door she turned one last time to her squad and performed a dramatic bow to them, receiving a round of applause in return.</p><p>“Rio! Rio!”</p><p>Rio span around in her strappy sandals and raised her brows only to immediately dart forward and grab the thing she’d left behind. “Shit.” She took her Oscar from her hair stylist and grinned at him, “Thanks.”</p><p>“Rio!!”</p><p>Rio grimaced and span back around and avoided Alice’s heavy glare as she slipped past her and into the hallway to catch up with her parents.</p><p>They eventually made it to the Vanity Fair After Party at the Wallis Annenberg Centre for the Performing Arts. The venue was twenty minutes away which meant that the four piled into the back of the sleek black SUV had just enough time to knock back two tequilas each. Or, three for Miguel, as Anna stopped after the first.</p><p>Rio’s anxiety was under control this time around. Perhaps it was the decent amount of alcohol in her system, perhaps it was the Oscar held firmly in her lap, perhaps it was the love she felt in that little car. But she felt good. She felt better than good.</p><p>She was on top of the world.</p><p>When they arrived Alice went back into business mode, although Rio was pleased that in the car she’d almost totally relaxed and hadn’t touched her phone once. She jumped out before Rio and helped her out the car and made sure her dress was covering all the right parts before she walked with her to the second red carpet of the day.</p><p>The noise was already too much but Rio gripped her Oscar tighter in her hand and marched with Alice to the centre of it all. The reaction to her was immediate, unbelievable.</p><p>Alice had to release her to allow her to move to the middle and Rio felt the loneliness that often plagued her when she was standing in the middle of a crowd of admirers. But she posed and smiled and winked and held up her Oscar for the world to see.</p><p>Just as it was beginning to get all too much, Alice moved in to hurry her along. There would be plenty of time for photos inside and Rio felt her chest loosen as they stepped towards the safety of the party.</p><p>But the noise didn’t stop when they walked in and Rio was taken off guard because she’d turned for her parents so didn’t see the crowds waiting for her.</p><p>Great yells and calls of her name rang through the space and Rio snapped her head back to see the who’s who of Hollywood charging for her. All had smiles on their faces and others were bowing to her where they stood.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio laughed as she was launched upon by three cast members. She continued to laugh as she was passed about the place like a joint at a frat party. She kissed every cheek she came across and only had to slow down the hugs when she had a glass of champagne in one hand an her Oscar in the other.</p><p>And somehow, she lost Alice in the mix. Her parents had slipped away too - intentionally or not, Rio didn’t know. But she’d found herself in the unfortunate position of being cornered by some studio bigwig who was complimenting her winning performance whilst staring at her breasts.</p><p>Apparently an Oscar didn’t mean she could get out of playing the game.</p><p>But her saviour arrived just as she was beginning to wonder if perhaps this man had a turn in both eyes, only the turn was <em>down</em>.</p><p>She was saved by warm arms wrapping snuggly around her.</p><p>“Reginald,” Agatha said coolly from where she was now pressed against Rio, her fingers splayed out to touch as much skin as possible in the cutout of Rio’s dress. “I think your girlfriend is over by the bar.”</p><p>Reginald spluttered and blushed more red than Rio’s dress and then disappeared into the crowds.</p><p>“Wife left him last year when she found out he was schtupping his secretary, now girlfriend.” Agatha’s voice was low and husky against her ear and Rio shivered at the sound of it, feeling Agatha press closer into her, under the guise of an elongated greeting.</p><p>“Agatha,” came a slightly less welcome voice close by. Jen appeared, brow set, eyes narrowed, “No one is trying to take her from you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned in Agatha’s arms to grin up at her but lost whatever witty remark she was about to deliver because of the sight before her.</p><p>Agatha was in silver. A sleeveless dress with a high neck. Her hair that had once been in a pristinely messy low bun was now loose in tumbling waves about her shoulders and she was looking at Rio like a predator who’d just caught her prey.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Jen warned quickly when she saw where brown eyes were dropping to and where blue eyes had already settled..</p><p>And Rio found herself stolen by Agatha’s manager. She was pulled from Agatha’s grip into a hug that was surprisingly warm. “I will ruin you if you even think for a second that trying for another one of those against Agatha will work in your favour. And… congratulations.”</p><p>Rio laughed and smiled as Jen pulled away, her face at least a little softer despite the threat. A hand on her back told her Agatha had moved back in and she shot her a glance before turning back to Jen, “I think the bigger issue than me beating Agatha again is that she just used the word ‘schtupping’.”</p><p>“Finish your champagne,” Agatha said with a smirk as she squeezed Rio’s side.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Just finish it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and judged the glass to be a little over half full and in that sense, downable, and then did exactly that.</p><p>“Your speech was good,” Jen said absently, sipping her own champagne as Rio grimaced and leant towards a nearby waiter to place her glass on his tray. “Charming. You’re charming.”</p><p>“Are you drunk, Jennifer?”</p><p>Agatha moved to her right side.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Jen said with a huff, “I guess that’s how you got so many votes. That and Agatha practically delivering you the actor’s branch.”</p><p>Rio smirked and felt Agatha take her hand. She looked down at it, and fought against asking if <em>this</em> was why Agatha wanted her to finish her champagne.</p><p>“Rio’s already been told that this is her one and only so we don’t need to worry.”</p><p>Rio scoffed as Agatha began to draw soft circles with her thumb on her hand and shot her a scowl. “So you <em>would</em> be worried?”</p><p>“It’s an expression.”</p><p>“Like ‘schtupping’?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at a grinning Rio and Jen cleared her throat, “Hey. Calm it down. God, even me and Alice-…”</p><p>“Alice and I,” and arriving Anna corrected with a smile as she slipped her arm around her daughter.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said with an innocent smile, “Jen was correct, Anna. She always comes first.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Jen spluttered with a mouthful of champagne and Rio laughed as Agatha squeezed her hand and went to gently slap her friend’s back.</p><p>Rio turned with a smile to her mom and raised her brows in question, “Where’s dad?”</p><p>“Encontró a Antonio y lo está molestando.” <em>He found Antonio and is bothering him.</em></p><p>“Banderas?” Rio groaned quietly and raised up on her tiptoes to try and spot her dad through the crowd. But it was so busy and the lights were dimmed enough that as far as five people deep she was no longer able to make out facial features.</p><p>“Where’s Alice?” Jen asked now she’d recovered from her drive by assault.</p><p>“She disappeared earlier when I was grabbed by-…”</p><p>“Hola!”</p><p>Before she even turned Rio grimaced and instinctively tugged Agatha a little closer as Ralph snuck around his wife and beamed his big grin at them all. As if they’d be pleased to see him.</p><p>“Agatha, the Gallaghers want to see you.”</p><p>Rio watched as he held his hand out to her and Agatha hesitated but didn’t take it. “Fine.”</p><p>She turned to Jen and smiled tersely before she looked around at Rio and Anna. “I’ll come find you.” She sealed her promise with a quick kiss to the back of Rio’s hand and then turned to march away with Ralph following up the rear.</p><p>Anna squeezed Rio’s middle and Jen pushed at her shoulder to get her attention. “You okay, Vidal?”</p><p>“Couldn’t be better.” Rio grinned at her, and felt her gaze bore into her which tempered the smile slightly and she was just about to ask what the hell Jen’s problem was when a new arrival in the group stole her attention.</p><p>“I am <em>so</em> sorry, Rio.”</p><p>Wanda was reaching to pull Rio into a tight hug, stealing her unintentionally from her mother’s hold. Rio returned it with a frown. “What for?”</p><p>“The lipstick. You had lipstick on your arm when you were up in stage. And- god! Fuck! Amazing! <em>Amazing</em>! Congratulations!”</p><p>Rio laughed as Wanda hugged her impossibly tighter, clearly trying to squeeze the forgiveness out of her as she did. “Wanda.” Rio patted her back uselessly. “Babe. Too tight.”</p><p>Wanda released her immediately and looked wide-eyed as she pulled back but held onto Rio’s shoulders, “You won an Oscar.”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“You beat Agatha.”</p><p>“Less of the ‘beat’, please,” Jen chimed in with a scowl, looking Wanda up and down with distaste.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and shimmied out of Wanda’s hold to pull her in with her arm around her shoulders. “Jen’s just pissed at me.”</p><p>“And you’re not with me?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned back to Wanda. “No. Why would I be?”</p><p>“I just…” And Rio frowned as she tugged Wanda in and kissed her cheek. “Relax, okay? I won a fucking Oscar. We’re here to celebrate”.</p><p>And with Rio’s word, it shall be done.</p><p>Jen softened enough to accept the idea of more champagne and for them all to move closer to the dancing. Eventually Alice appeared back to them and told tales of the amount of people wanting a formal intro to Rio that she had - much to Rio’s delight - pushed back on to allow her client to relax that evening.</p><p>At some point Miguel appeared again, more than a little merry on the tequila he’d been sharing with Antonio. And Anna decided to leave now would be a blessing to everyone; least of all her husband’s head in the morning.</p><p>But Rio didn’t see Agatha again for a while, and she lost Jen too, until one particularly graceful spin beneath an actor’s arm on the edge of the dance floor made a flash of silver enter her vision. She managed to remain upright and extricated herself from the man before she made her way to Agatha and arrived at her side.</p><p>“Oh, Rio Vidal!”</p><p>Rio smiled politely as she slipped her arm around Agatha. “Hello. Sorry to interrupt.”</p><p>“Not at all!” Rio had no idea who this man was but he seemed polite and she really wouldn’t mind even talking to Ralph if she could stand all night with Agatha in her hold.</p><p>“Jason, this is Rio. Rio, Jason,” Agatha said, indicating both in turn and then placing her arm around Rio’s back too.</p><p>“Jason is a VC at my firm,” Ralph said. Nevermind, Rio thought, she definitely minded having to talk to Ralph, even when wrapped up in his wife.</p><p>“Pleasure to meet you,” Rio trilled, wondering how long it would be until she could whisk Agatha away from this financier and her shitty husband.</p><p>Agatha clearly felt the same because she squeezed Rio’s side. Just as Ralph opened his mouth again the cavalry arrived in the form of Jen and Alice and Rio felt her shoulders relax at the sight of them and she grinned as she caught Alice’s gaze.</p><p>“So, Rio, what will you do with your new little trophy? Take it to some bars and pick up some chicks?”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha pull her closer but it somehow felt protective rather than possessive. She glanced at her and then smiled serenely over at Ralph.</p><p>“Oh, Ralph. I don’t need an Oscar to pick up women.”</p><p>Alice snorted across from her and even Jen smiled but tried to hide it behind her champagne glass.</p><p>“Won’t pick up many hanging off my wife like that.”</p><p>“She’s cold,” Rio countered without thinking, “I’m keeping her warm.”</p><p>Ralph handed his glass to Alice who took it only because she was shocked into it and he shrugged off his jacket. Before Rio could protest and before Agatha could, he was moving to place it over her shoulders.</p><p>And Rio lost her hold on Agatha, and smiled tightly at the sight of her in her husband’s jacket. But Agatha only grinned at her and pulled her back in again. Rio’s arm slotted beneath the jacket and around Agatha’s waist once more as Agatha draped her arm over Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>And Rio had to look at the floor for fear she was grinning too damn much about it.</p><p>“There,” Agatha said with some finality, “Warm again.”</p><p>Ralph sniffed and Rio dared to look up at him, feeling beside her that Agatha already was too. And he looked momentarily stunned. His square jaw was tighter than Rio had ever seen it and he cleared his throat as he knocked back the rest of his whiskey.</p><p>“Jason,” he said after too-long a silence to be casual, “Another, my good man?”</p><p>“Yes! Delicious.”</p><p>Jason performed a rather strange little bow to them all and Rio watched them disappear off towards the large bar at the back of the room.</p><p>“What a fucking-…” But she stopped herself just in time to bite her tongue.</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said as if Ralph hadn’t been there at all and Rio hadn’t just stopped herself from slandering her husband. “Ten minutes.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and looked between the two women and then turned to Alice who looked equally confused.</p><p>“Ten minutes, what?”</p><p>“Us. Follow me.”</p><p>Agatha turned on her heel and began marching off in the opposite direction of Ralph and his little finance bro friend and she didn’t move for a while, momentarily stupefied in surprise.</p><p>“Ten minutes, Rio,” Jen reminded. “Now. Go. Now.”</p><p>Rio blinked and then hurried after Agatha, tottering behind her until she finally caught up and muttered, “Agatha? What the fuck. Where are you going?”</p><p>“Shh,” Agatha hushed, only briefly glancing at Rio over her shoulder as she continued on through the crowds. “I’m taking you somewhere.”</p><p>“Umm,” Rio frowned. “Where?”</p><p>“A place.”</p><p>“God, Agatha. And how exactly did you find out about this ‘place’?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t say anything as she moved with purpose now, speeding up and ignoring anyone who tried to grab her. Rio did the same though was a bit more polite about it and either shot people apologetic smiles or simply waved as she flew past.</p><p>So distracted by having to silently apologise over and over she didn’t even realise when she suddenly found herself in a random hallway that was much brighter than the hall they’d just been in. The walls were more highly decorated and the building was clearly older and Rio realised that Agatha had taken them into what must have been the restored old Post Office that joined onto the more modern part of the building.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>Agatha was looking around now, her eyes on the ceilings and the walls and Rio smiled in amusement, wondering what she was looking for.</p><p>“A busboy said it’s where they go to light up.”</p><p>“A busboy spoke to you?” Rio found that hard to believe, and even harder to believe that a busboy not only spoke to the great and intimidating Agatha Harkness but told her where he and his buddies went to smoke a joint.</p><p>“Well, no. Jen.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and stopped abruptly when Agatha did in front of a service elevator down the length of the hallway and off to the right. “Are you kidding?”</p><p>“Do you want to come or not?” Agatha turned to her with raised brows and her hand already on the handle.</p><p>“You made Jen find someplace we could sneak off together?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio looked from her brows to her hand and only took a second before she nodded and grinned, “Obviously I do.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha huffed as she ripped open the door and stepped in after Rio.</p><p>Rio stood back as Agatha heaved the heavy door shut again and then pressed the button that indicated down.</p><p>Rio smiled to herself as she stared at the back of Agatha’s head and wondered if she were being so snappy because she was nervous or if Ralph back there really had riled her up the wrong way.</p><p>“You know Jen once told me that you and Ralph would get on better if you had more sex.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha stiffened, even beneath Ralph’s jacket she could see the telltale signs of Agatha’s back straightening an inch or two and remaining rigid as she stood there.</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>“Mmhm. That was before she knew you never did, obviously.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything even as the elevator came to a stop and she wrenched open the door, stepping out before Rio could.</p><p>Rio laughed to herself as she followed Agatha but her laughter died slowly as she realised that they were now deep within the bowels of the venue where it was dark, cold, and deserted.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said with a frown, still following behind, “Are you sure about this?”</p><p>“We don’t have a choice.”</p><p>“Actually I hear there are many hotels nearby. In fact, I already have a room. Perhaps we could-…”</p><p>But Agatha had stopped abruptly at a random door and turned to raise her brows at Rio, “Have you changed your mind about this?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then can you please be quiet and get inside.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and Agatha opened the door to what was essentially a janitor’s closet. It was a concrete square room with an old vacuum in the corner, an upturned table with a smattering of ash over it and a suspicious white power sprinkled about it.</p><p>The little pile of empty baggies nearby only confirmed what Rio already knew it to be.</p><p>But Rio moved through the room until she found a clear enough spot and rested back against the cool concrete of the wall.</p><p>She laughed as she watched Agatha turn the lock in the door. “Who will find us down here? A couple busboys looking for a line?”</p><p>“Just being cautious.”</p><p>The light swinging from the ceiling flickered and she heard the buzzing of electricity somewhere overhead. Like a sparking hummingbird seeking its nectar.</p><p>“Not a very glam rendezvous.”</p><p>“Pourquoi non?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows as she turned back to Rio and moved closer, her gaze dropping to the golden statue still hanging by her side.</p><p>“You speak French?”</p><p>Agatha hummed from low in her throat, her gaze now roaming the length of Rio’s body and leaving a blazing trail of heat beneath it. She moved closer dropped Ralph’s blazer on the dusty floor. Rio straightened a little, watching with wide eyes as Agatha took her time in taking her in. Her fingertips rested against her hips, lighting skimming over the fabric until she was brushing up her torso, teasing slower along Rio’s exposed abs until, eventually, her hand found Rio’s throat and Rio raised her chin slightly and her brows with it, enjoying the slowness of it all, the way Agatha was clearly taking her all in, her left hand only now back to grazing her hip.</p><p>“I went to the best private school in the country. Of course I speak French.”</p><p>Rio made a soft noise, feeling Agatha’s thumb brush to the base of her throat.</p><p>“If you wanna speak French some more, I wouldn’t mind.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>Rio grinned as Agatha pressed in against her, pushing her more firmly into the concrete wall. “It makes you impossibly sexier.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow and moved her gaze to Rio’s lips, raising her thumb slowly to apply a little pressure to her lower one and make Rio pout it out. “We can’t kiss,” she whispered, her brows now knitting together, “Nothing that’ll make it obvious.”</p><p>“You took me all the way down here,” Rio said with an amused smile, turning her head to escape Agatha’s thumb, “and you’re telling me I can’t kiss you?”</p><p>“I didn’t say you couldn’t do other things.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and Agatha’s eyes widened just a little and her grip tightened on her waist. She pressed closer and Rio felt the keen sting of the cold, hard wall against her upper back.</p><p>“You really won’t let me kiss you?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand skimmed down to wrap tenderly around her throat again and Rio raised her brows and waited patiently for Agatha to make a move. She expected her to go back on her word.</p><p>“No kissing,” she murmured, frowning at her own words as the hand on Rio’s waist moved up to bury in the back of Rio’s hair, protecting her head from the wall. “Pas ce soir.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and was rewarded with a soft squeeze at the sides of her throat, “What are you doing to me?”</p><p>“I think we have at least thirty minutes, don’t you?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio insisted a little more firmly than before and Agatha’s eyes flashed in response, her steely blue gaze gradually darkening as the light continued to flicker overhead.</p><p>“We can’t just stand like this for thirty minutes.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and then began to gather up the fabric of Rio’s dress with her left hand, “Is that right?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but just as she felt a rush of cold air hit her upper thigh the light flickered out completely and they were left in the semi-darkness. Agatha paused what she was doing and glanced over her shoulder, though for what, Rio wasn’t sure.</p><p>“Scared? I’ll protect you, cariño.”</p><p>Agatha turned back around and met Rio’s grin with a smirk of her own, now continuing her explorations underneath Rio’s dress. “I think <em>I’m</em> the one with <em>you</em> pinned up against the wall.”</p><p>Rio laughed until Agatha turned her hand and cupped her through her underwear and she groaned quietly when she squeezed her throat. “But it feels like you’re enjoying it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes looked practically black in the semi-darkness and Rio bit down on her lip as she pulled her underwear aside and touched her for the first time since their night together in the hotel. She tried not to moan with it, tried not to gasp out as Agatha took her time exploring her, finding her already soaked and desperate.</p><p>Why she was going so slow, she had no idea.</p><p>She made no real attempt to give Rio what she knew she wanted and instead was simply exploring, clearly enjoying the soft keening of the woman pressed against the wall and quivering for her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio eventually breathed after what felt like an age of Agatha touching her without giving her anything. She rocked her hips a little. “Please.”</p><p>“Please what, honey?”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em> begging,” Rio laughed out as she felt Agatha’s fingers dip further down, circling her entrance now. “Jesus.”</p><p>“An Oscar in your hand and you’d still give it all up for me to touch you.”</p><p>Rio groaned and gasped and felt her cheeks flush and Agatha grinned at the sight of it. “Would you?”</p><p>“God. Yes. Yes. Just-…”</p><p>And Rio practically mewled as Agatha pressed her first knuckle inside of her, barely giving her anything at all. Rio huffed and rocked her hips for more but Agatha held firm, her hold tightening around her throat.</p><p>“You’re being <em>withholding</em>,” Rio accused, groaning as the fingers around her throat flexed.</p><p>“Did you like it when she kissed you?”</p><p>Rio frowned and tried to rock her hips again but was met with a squeeze once more and Agatha remained only one knuckle deep.</p><p>“When who…?” <em>Wanda</em>. Rio groaned and rocked her hips more insistently but Agatha only pulled her hand away entirely, “It was just my arm, my cheek. Jesus, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head a little, a warning as Rio rocked her hips again and clutched at Agatha’s arm, “Please.”</p><p>“Her lipstick was on you when you were on the stage.”</p><p>Rio sighed and moved her hand to cup Agatha’s face, she attempted to lean in but Agatha forcefully held her back making Rio gasp suddenly.</p><p>She groaned as she moved her hand to grasp Agatha’s wrist. She watched as Agatha’s gaze dropped to her own hand around her throat and she gasped quietly at the intensity of her blue black eyes.</p><p>She swallowed with difficultly and the said in a low voice, “Then you <em>know</em> how to stop it happening again.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold tightened and Rio gasped, her airway suddenly constricted until Agatha released again and she could suck in a desperate breath.</p><p>“Kiss me,” Rio begged, frowning at the sight of Agatha’s eyes darting over her face, unable or unwilling to meet her gaze now. “Put your lipstick,” she panted softly, “all over me.”</p><p>Agatha leant in and Rio tightened her hold on her wrist, gasping quietly when she felt Agatha’s breath against her parted lips. Their noses brushed, once accidentally, the second time on purpose as Agatha seemed to soften, and when she spoke she was quiet, almost timid with it, “I can’t. Not in the way I want to.”</p><p>Rio nodded, Agatha’s hold now performative rather than unyielding as it once had been, and she gasped when Agatha finally pressed back into her, thrusting harder this time, and pressing her full weight against her.</p><p>Rio moaned properly, unashamed of the volume as Agatha fucked her against the wall. And Rio’s hand clutched at the fabric of Agatha’s dress, her hips desperately trying to rock even as she was held in place and Agatha found her clit.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck.” Something about the anticipation of it, the teasing and the proximity had made Rio sensitive, and Agatha wasn’t being gentle anymore. The way Agatha’s bicep tensed and flexed with every movement of her arm. Rio couldn’t look away from it, mesmerised by the show of her muscle, more grateful than she’d ever been to the person who chose for Agatha to go sleeveless that night.</p><p>She fucked her harshly, pressing a second finger inside without warning, stretching her jealously, her lips still tauntingly close to Rio’s, her hand around her throat tightening with every moan.</p><p>And Rio came with a cry, and then hissed when Agatha pressed more firmly against her clit, and she almost dropped the Oscar still in her hand because of it. “A-Agatha, enough.”</p><p>Agatha pulled from inside of Rio and made her shiver at the suddenness of it but she dropped her head and nudged the bridge of her nose into Rio’s jaw, and Rio gasped quietly as she felt her thumb brush its gentle apology over her clit.</p><p>“I want to,” Agatha said quietly, her breath spilling warm over Rio’s throat as she picked up the fragments of their conversation, “So desperately.”</p><p>Rio nodded as best she could, turning her head downwards to press her cheek into Agatha’s. “Lo sé, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha moved her hand away slowly, making sure Rio’s underwear was back in place before she wiped her hand gently against her thigh. Rio shivered as her dress tumbled back down as Agatha pulled her hand out entirely and Rio sighed as her eyes closed and Agatha leant against her properly. She arched up to allow her arms to snake around her back and she held her, feeling her breathing even out against her skin.</p><p>“Agatha? This is getting harder. Sneaking around, I mean.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha admitted, but didn’t move away.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and knew this could go one of two ways. And the easiest route to go down would not make for a fun night. She sucked in her sadness and whispered, “But something to discuss next week? Because right now, as dark and frightening as this place is… it’s also hella sexy that you’ve dragged me here, revealed you speak French, and fucked me against the wall.”</p><p>To her relief Agatha laughed and the promise of it against her neck made Rio feel warm all over. Agatha was pulling back, a faint smile across her lips, “The French really got to you, huh?”</p><p>“Oui.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and in a much better accent corrected: “<em>Oui</em>.”</p><p>Rio grinned and raised her brows, “See? Very sexy.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes again but her smile was sadder and Rio sighed as she reached to hold her cheek, watching wistfully as Agatha closed her eyes and leant into it.</p><p>She let her rest for a second, let her sit in her own thoughts and watched them wash over her until she could not longer stand to witness it. “Agatha?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Maybe you can speak to me in French while I go down on you?”</p><p>That made Agatha’s eyes open.</p><p>Rio grinned. “S’il vous plaît?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile slowly grew up her face as Rio said in all seriousness, “I believe you once had a fantasy about me going down on you with an award by my side? Seems only appropriate I do it now with an Oscar, no?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip in a move Rio assumed was to try and keep her cool by not grinning too much and Rio only smirked as she pushed Agatha away and began to turn them, soon pressing Agatha back against the wall in the spot she’d just been in.</p><p>“Hold your dress for me?”</p><p>When Agatha was mute like this, Rio knew she had her exactly where she wanted her. So she smiled serenely, and lifted her own dress to give herself enough give to be able to drop down to her knees.</p><p>She hesitated for just a second before she grabbed Ralph’s blazer from where Agatha had so disinterestedly thrown it earlier and she made a show of folding it so she could rest her knees on it and not risk her custom dress.</p><p>Because she was about to fuck his wife. And also: <em>fuck Ralph.</em></p><p>When she looked up again she saw that Agatha had followed her instructions and Rio smiled at the sight. Her pale legs beneath the silver dress were toned and Agatha was tense, that much was clear.</p><p>Rio reached her right hand up to caress over her thigh slowly, trying to relax the tension there as her eyes fixated on the white lace that covered her next meal.</p><p>Rio leant in slowly and kissed just above Agatha’s right knee, smiling as she pulled away and saw the lipstick she’d left there. She pressed more kisses up her thigh until there was a trail of lipstick, each kiss now painting the journey to Agatha’s pussy.</p><p>Agatha’s breathing had picked up a little but she was still silent as Rio placed her Oscar down and with both hands she tugged at Agatha’s underwear until it was halfway down her thighs. She leant back and manoeuvred it off of Agatha, helping her get it over her heels until she had hold of it and wrapped it securely around the gold man now back in her lap.</p><p>“That’s so unhygienic,” Agatha muttered as Rio looked up at her with raised brows.</p><p>“Not sexy at all?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and Rio laughed as she raised the Oscar up, “I think it’s <em>incredibly</em> hot to have your-…”</p><p>“Are you going to do anything or are you just going to keep yapping?”</p><p>“Yapping?”</p><p>Rio laughed again and moved her hand up to push Agatha’s legs open a little more, “I suppose there are better things I could do with my mouth.”</p><p>She looked up as she leant in and scratched tenderly up and down Agatha’s thigh. Agatha released a shuddering breath from above her and Rio smiled as she raised the Oscar between them and locked eyes with her as she sucked on the golden statue’s head.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Agatha warned quickly, though her eyes were wide as Rio made her cheeks hollow and then released the head with a soft <em>pop</em>.</p><p>“No?” She grinned as she leant in closer and flicked her tongue out to swipe the tip of it delicately through Agatha’s wet cunt, pausing only for a second before she pressed in a little more and applied gentle kitten licks until she felt the tip of her tongue nudge against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha gasped, the hand not holding her dress now making its claim on Rio’s hair, holding her in place. But Rio had to be delicate, she had to be careful and neat. She had to not spend the rest of the evening with Agatha all over her face - as much as she wanted to.</p><p>She groaned quietly as she pulled back a little and with her right hand she pressed her middle and forefinger in against Agatha’s clit, rubbing in slowly circles alongside it.</p><p>“Baby,” she husked out, looking back up at the woman standing before her, “Will you please let me fuck you with my Oscar? Please?”</p><p>Agatha groaned above her and Rio slowed her movements down, watching as Agatha’s hips stirred with every brush of her clit. “Baby.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a shaking breath and Rio grinned as she looked down at her, “Clean it again.”</p><p>So Rio did. She raised it to her lips and this time took more than the golden head into her mouth. She pushed down to the mid torso and watched as Agatha’s tongue darted out to lick her lips as she enjoyed the show.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha breathed out and Rio moaned around the award before she pulled it out again.</p><p>She was quick to replace her fingers with it, quick to press the head of the trophy against Agatha’s clit, applying as much pressure as she dared as she moved her hand down to tease at Agatha’s entrance, able to push both fingers in when Agatha moaned loudly and her hips jerked to encourage it.</p><p>She felt Agatha squeeze around her fingers and Rio set a slow rhythm, allowing Agatha to rock her hips like a metronome, keeping the time and the strength of Rio’s thrusts under her control.</p><p>The Oscar’s head rested against Agatha’s clit, and Agatha rubbed herself off against it with every movement and moan.</p><p>Rio couldn’t not stare, her mouth felt dry and her clit throbbed with desire at the sight of Agatha getting herself off on her Oscar and fingers. But she needed to taste her again, she needed her to come against her tongue or she felt like she might die.</p><p>Agatha whimpered when Rio pulled out of her but Rio moved the award down, placing her free hand against Agatha’s hips to hold her in place as she cautiously pressed the head against her needy hole.</p><p>It was smooth metal, wet now from Rio’s spit and Agatha’s slick. About two finger widths thick, and rounded well enough for Rio to press inside of Agatha, causing them both to moan loudly, one at the sight the other at the feel.</p><p>“Holy shit,” Rio mumbled as she stared at the place Agatha was now riding her Oscar, her name shining back at her from the engraved base, Agatha’s damp underwear wrapped around the statues legs.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped above her, moving her hips again as Rio pulled the head halfway out and the thrust back in, only going as deep as the shoulders. “I need your tongue, honey. Now.”</p><p>Rio obliged immediately, moving her fore and middle fingers to tease out and frame Agatha’s clit  as she rolled the tip of her tongue round and round it and fucked her slowly, carefully with the head of the Oscar.</p><p>Agatha was needy with her hips, trying to direct Rio to get closer, to give more. But Rio had to be salient, had to be neat about it, and she managed to not give in by the time Agatha came with a broken moan and a rolling of her hips that made Rio feel feral.</p><p>She pulled away slowly, removing the Oscar and scissoring her fingers to open Agatha up more so she could dip down and dip her tongue into where she’d just been fucking her.</p><p>Agatha tasted warm and somehow sweet. She lapped at her a little longer before drawing a thick strip back through her up to her clit and then placed a soft kiss to the small bundle of hair at the mound of her pussy.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio murmured quietly, letting Agatha feel the words against the skin of her thigh, as she kissed over the lipstick she’d already left there.</p><p>Agatha shuddered a breath above her, her fingers tightening briefly in her hair before she released it and curled her hand around to lift Rio’s chin up.</p><p>The room was still dark but Rio’s eyes had adjusted now and she could see the tenderness stitched into every line and curve of Agatha’s face. Agatha dropped down slowly, crouching before Rio with her dress still up around her waist and her knees bare and either side of her. But she didn’t look away. She kept her gaze on Rio’s face and for a second Rio thought she might tell her she loved her too. But she instead leant in and kissed Rio softly, so softly it made Rio melt from the inside out and when she pulled away she whispered, “How did we get here?”</p><p>“You grabbed my hand and dragged me to-…”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha swallowed and shifted to rest her knees on Ralph’s now filthy jacket either side of Rio’s legs, “I mean,” she paused and took the Oscar to place it to the side, “with us?”</p><p>“Is that a rhetorical question?” Rio asked with a frown and an uncomfortable weight suddenly in her chest as she rubbed lightly over Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>“I just never thought…” but Agatha trailed off, her frown matching Rio’s and now lost from view as she moved to press delicate kisses to Rio’s cheek and temple, her thumb following the trail and making sure to wipe away any lipstick mark left behind. Rio leant into her, moving her hands up to anchor on Agatha’s hips, her eyes fluttering closed as Agatha cradled her face.</p><p>Rio shifted, and dropped her head to the crook of Agatha’s neck, and in doing so was able to breathe her in properly, and Agatha moved her hold to be more secure around her, until they were just two actresses curled up together in the darkness of a deserted janitor’s closet.</p><p>“We should leave,” Agatha whispered after a couple minutes of silence where Rio could think of nothing other than how good it felt to be pressed against Agatha.</p><p>“Can’t we just live down here?”</p><p>“I’d rather not, thank you.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she pulled away and saw the same reluctance she felt across Agatha’s soft features. “My makeup okay?”</p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha whispered as she brushed her thumb across Rio’s lower lip. “Help me put my underwear back on?”</p><p>Agatha stood up again and she unwilling untied the lace thong from the Oscar. “I think it looks better where it was.”</p><p>“Did you just tell me I don’t look good in a thong?”</p><p>“You <em>know</em> I didn’t mean that.”</p><p>Agatha huffed as she rested her hand for balance on Rio’s shoulder and lifted her leg for Rio to slide her underwear up her ankle. She repeated the movement until Rio blindly lifted them up Agatha’s thighs and secured the underwear properly, feeling her way to make sure the fabric wasn’t twisted.</p><p>“There, good as new.”</p><p>She squeezed Agatha’s ass for good measure and grinned up at her as she clung on.</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You have to let go now.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but didn’t release her hold and in fact only squeezed tighter which caused Agatha’s hips to twitch just slightly in her direction.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned softly. Rio’s lips quirked up at the sides and she stuck her tongue in her cheek as she slowly loosened her grip and brought her hands back down to rest at Agatha’s ankles.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said in that same soft tone that made Rio scramble to her feet faster than if she’d been shouted at. Agatha hummed as she draped her arms across Rio’s shoulders and leant back against the wall. “Maybe I’ll bring my Oscar to Berkeley. See if we can get him all the way inside you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and dropped her gaze to Agatha’s lips, “Is that one of the toys you were talking about?”</p><p>“No but I think we should try it anyway.”</p><p>Rio smirked, her hold now around Agatha’s waist, squeezing her close, “What would The Academy say if they knew?”</p><p>“Oh, they’d just be thrilled their ugly little awards were getting some use.”</p><p>A flickering above their heads made them both look up and Rio raised her brows as the light stuttered back to life. She squinted and blinked against the sudden brightness and felt Agatha pull away. “We should go.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t argue because they’d already pushed their time together to the limit and she knew that Alice would be having kittens at this point. She was just glad her parents had left the party and she wouldn’t have to lie to them about where she’d been.</p><p>Agatha pressed her Oscar back to her and grimaced when she did. “Perhaps wash that when we get back up there.”</p><p>“Why? It’s now more precious than ever.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but Rio caught her fighting a smile as she stepped from the dusty little room.</p><p>At the last second Agatha turned back and snatched up Ralph’s forgotten jacket and smacked it against the wall a few times to knock off the dust. Rio smirked at the sight and watched as Agatha brushed it down to remove the evidence of the tryst taken place in the bowels of the Wallis Annenberg.</p><p>“Tell me you’re not going to put that back on.”</p><p>“Of course not,” Agatha said with a grin, pausing just by Rio as she stood at the door. “I’m going to make Ralph put it on.”</p><p>Rio was momentarily lost for words as she watched Agatha stride into the darkness but she gathered herself and tottered after her in her heels, managing to catch up and grab her hand before they got to the service elevator.</p><p>“You’re evil.”</p><p>“You don’t want my husband punished just a little bit?”</p><p>“I want him dead, actually. But I’m not sure I’d get away with it.”</p><p>They stepped inside and Agatha released Rio’s hand, letting Rio do the work of pulling the heavy concertina door closed. “You want him dead?”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>Rio caught something shy in Agatha’s gaze and she raised her brows, aware Agatha wouldn’t let her near again for fear they were being watched by some security guard not paid enough to spend his days watching the comings and goings on a random service elevator in a random converted Post Office.</p><p>“That’s almost romantic,” Agatha eventually said, stealing a quick glance at Rio as she made to open the door when they arrived above ground.</p><p>From there they walked back together, both silent, both allowing their hands to brush as often as possible without ever acknowledging it. By the time they’d slipped through the deserted halls - coming across only one or two frantic busboys on the way - Agatha had draped Ralph’s jacket delicately over her arm and Rio was clutching her Oscar like the proud winner she was - only now she was prouder because of where she’d just been allowed to put it.</p><p>They went their separate ways without so much as a glance and Rio managed to disappear into the ladies and under the pretence of peeing then washing her hands she ‘accidentally’ knocked her award into the sink and quickly swiped at it with soapy hands to ensure anyone who wanted a photo with it later wouldn’t leave with the memory of Agatha Harkness’s orgasm on their hands, or worse, their lips.</p><p>She dried it quickly with a luxurious fabric hand towel and just as she was leaving she saw a familiar face staring at her through the mirror looking less than happy to see her.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Alice! You almost gave me a heart attack.”</p><p>“Do you know that you were missing for forty three minutes?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and saw her own cheeks flush in the mirror, “What do you mean? I’ve been around.”</p><p>“<em>Around?</em> I’ve just seen Agatha appear as if from nowhere looking like she’s the cat that got the fucking cream.”</p><p>Rio winced and through the mirror looked to try and see if she could spot any feet beneath the stalls.</p><p>“I’ve already checked.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio said quietly, taking her time to place the Oscar on the side as she turned to look at her friend properly. “We were careful.”</p><p>“Forty three minutes worth of careful?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, more out of frustration than disagreement, and dropped her gaze to the floor. “We just needed time to be-…”</p><p>“Babe you’re about to have a whole week together.”</p><p>“Do you understand how hard it is to never get to touch her? Or kiss her? Or-?”</p><p>But the door had swung open and Rio slammed her mouth shut as Lilia Calderu walked in. “Well, well, if it isn’t my daughter-in-law!”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, so shocked by this exclamation that she took a second to clock on. But of course Lilia was talking about the movie they were about to film together. “Lilia, hey.”</p><p>“And, Alice, you must be so proud.”</p><p>Alice smiled as best she could into the hug that Lilia was currently giving her. Rio found this funnier than she should have, given the current circumstance.</p><p>“And <em>you</em>!” Lilia released a bewildered Alice and held her arms open to Rio to pull her into an inexplicably strong hug. But there was apparently a reason for it. Lilia pressed her lips to Rio’s ear and muttered against it, “You have dust along the hem of your dress.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flamed as she pulled away from Lilia and caught her eye for just the briefest moment and knew, more certain than she’d ever been in her life, that Lilia knew what her and Agatha had been doing.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and just as she was about to duck down to fix her little issue, Lilia did it for her.</p><p>“Oh, Lilia you don’t-…”</p><p>“Consider it my gift to you for your win.”</p><p>Rio grimaced in mortification and dared to glance at Alice who looked horrified but kept her mouth shut. As Lilia straightened again, now satisfied that Rio was dust-free, a gaggle of women entered the bathroom and Rio went from mortified to humble and thrilled in less than a second.</p><p>Lilia winked at her amidst the other women and then marched away to use the bathroom for it’s intended purpose.</p><p>Because Rio knew that Alice couldn’t be mad at her in front of anyone, she encouraged the women around her, asking if her speech was okay, if she looked as nervous as she felt, and whether or not they’d be on the dance floor later.</p><p>But Alice would only wait so long.</p><p>Rio was soon extracted with military precision and heaved out of the bathroom back into the party. “We’ll talk about it when we’re home.”</p><p>“It really wasn’t that bad,” Rio said from the corner of her mouth as she took a champagne from a nearby tray.</p><p>“Forty five minutes, Rio!”</p><p>“You said forty <em>three</em> earlier.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes and just as she was about to respond an arm wrapped around her waist and Jen pressed her cheek against her temple, holding Alice close as she stared across at Rio. “Back again, are we?”</p><p>“Everyone is really keeping a close eye on my comings and goings.”</p><p>“Was that clever word play, Vidal?” Jen asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Rio smirked but shrugged as she sipped her champagne. “Where’s Agatha?”</p><p>“Not put a tracker on her yet? She’s with Ralph.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but looked around in surprise when Jen touched her arm, “Hey, how’re you feeling about it all?”</p><p>“About…?” Rio frowned as she turned properly to Jen, Alice still standing in front of her, “Jen, why do you keep asking me all these strange questions? It’s like you think I’m going to drop her or something.”</p><p>But Jen dropped her gaze and Rio looked to her best friend who looked as confused and concerned as she felt. “Look,” Jen said sternly, just as Alice had opened her mouth to speak, “I love her, okay? I want to make up for that fact that-…” she huffed and moved from being wrapped around Alice to standing beside her. “I want her to be <em>happy</em> and I want you to know that she <em>is</em> and I’m worried that… I just want you to remember that she’s complex and <em>scared</em> and sometimes people who are scared don’t-…”</p><p>“There you are!”</p><p>Rio flinched as she turned to the last person she wanted to see. Ralph.</p><p>“Ralph,” Jen said in a flat tone, her look of consternation gone suddenly as she looked up at the man who, Rio noted with a jolt of satisfaction, was now wearing the jacket she’d just been kneeling on to eat out his wife.</p><p>“Aggie’s in the ladies and I couldn’t see you through the crowds. Need to wear more sparkles, Jen.”</p><p>Rio looked away for fear she looked far too pissed off with him to even attempt to laugh at his stupid joke as he now tugged at Jen’s particularly glittery sleeve.</p><p>“And you,” he said suddenly, draping an arm around Rio’s shoulders and leaning in so Rio could smell the whisky on his breath. “I haven’t had a chance to properly congratulate you. You missed me when you won. Don’t tell me that was deliberate?”</p><p>Rio turned her head and found that Ralph’s face was a lot closer than she was expecting and she had to fight the instinct to sneer as she simply raised her brows innocently at him, “Deliberate? Ralph I could barely remember my own name. Of course it wasn’t.”</p><p>Ralph eyed her for a second and then seemed to decide that no one in their right mind would deliberately avoid a kiss from him or a hand up to the stage so he grinned and did something so horrifying that Rio almost shoved him. He placed a big, hard, kiss to her cheek, the arm that had been around her shoulders had moved so his hand was on her hip and he pressed himself closer than Rio had ever felt him.</p><p>It was stifling, sickening, enraging.</p><p>When Ralph pulled away he hadn’t noticed how Rio was feeling at all and just grinned at her, his handsome face large due to his proximity, his blue eyes upon closer inspection dull and unfocused and Rio, forgetting herself for just a second asked: “Are you drunk?”</p><p>He laughed and leant in again, his breath hot and sticky against her ear, “Are <em>you</em>, Rio?”</p><p>He laughed again, but it reverberated against her eardrum this time and Rio’s equilibrium shifted as the intensity of it created a wave of dizziness and it was in this rush that Ralph’s hand slipped from her hip and ghosted over her ass. Rio stumbled from it, only to be caught by his other arm, strong and steady.</p><p>She let him help her stand, ignored Alice as she asked her what was wrong, and turned to him, saw the grin still on his face, the absolute certainty that was present in those drunk eyes that he was right, that he was desirable, that Rio should be so lucky.</p><p>“All the alcohol in the world,” she said in a low voice, aware that Alice and now Jen were circling around to her, “could never make me drunk enough.”</p><p>Ralph’s smile faltered only briefly, flickering like the light that had struggled so in the basement before, but Rio kept her chin up, her gaze fierce and didn’t look away. Ralph eventually did. He turned to Jen, his best chance at an ally, and grinned that same grin at her, still entitled, still sure he was owed the world.</p><p>“Hey,” Alice wrapped her arm around Rio, not quite understanding <em>what</em> had happened but knowing that something <em>had</em>.</p><p>“Fetch me a drink, Jennifer?” Ralph winked at Jen, and Rio kept her eyes on him, no longer hiding her disgust. “There’s a good girl.”</p><p>“Fuck you, man.”</p><p>“Alice,” Jen said quickly, stepping in where her girlfriend had stood up for her. “Not really in my job description, Ralph. But I’d be glad to walk you to the bar if you need the help.”</p><p>Ralph inclined his head and offered his arm and Rio was surprised when Jen looped her arm through it and shot them both a look before she walked away with him.</p><p>Alice jostled Rio to look at her and when she did she saw that Alice looked as furious as she felt. “What happened?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p>Rio knocked back her champagne and winced. “Nothing, Alice.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I believe it’s <em>my</em> day and I’d like to continue celebrating it. Given I can’t celebrate it how I’d like to-…”</p><p>“You always talk more when you’re excited or nervous or lying.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her tongue and stared at Alice for a little while before she eventually said: “I hate him. I hate that she’s married to him. I hate that he’s touched her and been inside her and-…”</p><p>“Babe,” Alice interrupted, more gentle now, frowning as she began to pull Rio to a quieter part of the room. “Deep breaths, okay? I don’t think he’ll be doing any of those things for much longer. Besides, you said they never even <em>have</em> sex, so at least you don’t need to worry about <em>that</em>.”</p><p>“You don’t know she’ll leave him.”</p><p>“Jen seems convinced.”</p><p>Rio sighed and looked up only to see people making their way over when she’d really rather be alone. Preferably alone with Agatha.</p><p>“Look,” Alice said more urgently this time, having clocked their impending interlopers, “This <em>is</em> your night. You’ve won a fucking Oscar. You’ve just had forty three minutes of what I’m sure was disgusting dusty sex with a MILF and everybody here <em>loves</em> you.”</p><p>“She’d kill you for calling her a MILF.”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Alice’s little speech had been timed to perfection, as if someone had written it for a scene, and they were descended upon as soon as her fingers had found Rio’s ribs to jab at her for being sarcastic when she’d been trying to be sincere.</p><p>But Rio slipped back into the woman everyone wanted her to be that night: the charming, gracious, Oscar winner.</p><p>And it worked. She played it so well that she began to feel it again. Thoughts of Ralph were forgotten as she was praised from every angle and introduced to more people in the span of the next hour than she could even comprehend.</p><p>She was the winner again, riding the same wave of joy and pride that she had been since she’d accepted the award. It hadn’t crested yet. It hadn’t even sputtered. Ralph wasn’t powerful enough to stop the tide.</p><p>And Oscar Winner Rio Vidal soon found herself leaning back against the bar, her elbows up against it, champagne in one hand, the Oscar in the other. Alice was talking to her about something that had already begun to become white noise though the people around them were eating it up. But Rio, Rio was distracted by the one person who could never become white noise.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was making her way across the room to her, her eyes honed in on Rio, and Rio felt frozen under her gaze, trapped by it, unraveled by it.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Agatha’s voice traveled through the din and Rio beamed as Agatha slipped her arm around her waist and pressed herself up close, taking a second to press a kiss to her cheek. And Rio felt her breathe her in, felt the warmth of her body in the press of it against her own. “Where have you been?”</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha pulled back to look at her and her hand slid from around her to rest on her hip. “Oh, revelling in my success, being adored.”</p><p>“Adored?”</p><p>“Tell me in French.”</p><p>“Adoré.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, “Adorada.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice was calling her name and Agatha turned from her to Alice and removed her hand from Rio’s hip in the process. Rio took a sip of champagne and watched Agatha from her place to the side of her, enjoying for a while just getting to look at her.</p><p>Alice was making introductions and Agatha took it all in her stride. And every so often, every few seconds, Agatha would turn to her, would smile or simply check she was still there. Rio wanted to reach for her in these moments. She wanted to smirk and pull her into her, hold her as Agatha continued to charm everyone in her orbit, and watch from close up as she dazzled.</p><p>She wanted to be as arrogant about it as Ralph was. She wanted to walk through the party and have everyone know that Agatha Harkness was hers and somewhere across the room Agatha was waiting for her to find her and kiss her, publicly, proudly.</p><p>She felt a gentle kick to her ankle and she turned to her side and raised her brows at Alice who was sipping her vodka soda through a metal straw. “Staring,” she muttered around the straw, making eyes at Rio then turning them to the subject of Rio’s attentions.</p><p>And Rio only laughed, sipped her champagne, kissed Alice’s cheek. “Who wouldn’t?”</p><p>She joined the conversation then, turning into the little group huddled together and found Agatha’s hand had found her wrist and was brushing her fingers over the soft skin there so tenderly that Rio could barely focus on the conversation - though she tried her hardest.</p><p>“Your mom told me you were going for dinner tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped around so quickly it almost snapped right off but she was glad of the excuse to talk to Agatha. “Yeah. A little place we found when I first moved here with Alice.”</p><p>“And then,” she watched as Agatha glanced at the people closest to them, “when will you leave the next day?”</p><p>Rio grinned and Agatha scowled at her for it, “As soon as I drop mom and dad off at the airport. So maybe around nine.”</p><p>“Why are you grinning?”</p><p>“It just sounds like you want to make sure I’m leaving as early as possible.”</p><p>“I just wanted to know when to expect you, is all.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her champagne and Rio laughed, “When are <em>you</em> leaving?”</p><p>“I’ll drop Nicky at school then head on up.”</p><p>“And you’re still set on,” Agatha looked around them again and Rio just smiled calmly as she finished her question, “separate cars?”</p><p>Agatha looked down for a second and then nodded, “It’s sensible.”</p><p>“I’m not sure what we just did was sensible so I don’t see-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmured quietly, turning more into her, separating them both slightly from the main group. “I need to think of… of more than just us. I need to think of Nicky. Okay?”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, and felt Agatha’s hand curl around her arm as someone tried to squeeze past Rio and Agatha was pulling her out of the way.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio murmured, “separate cars. No complaints.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her fingers squeezing Rio’s arm gently before she dropped her hold and returned her attention to the main group.</p><p>They stood, arms pressed together, Agatha’s fingers eventually curling around Rio’s on her Oscar, and the night felt suddenly like a dream.</p><p>But every dream ends in a wakening. Alice was the one to pull her from it. She exchanged words with Jen and they both then turned to their clients to deliver the news: it was time to go home.</p><p>“Five more minutes?”</p><p>“No, babe. Home. Now. Whilst the going is good, come on.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned to Agatha to hold the back of her head and place a firm kiss to her cheek. “I love you. I can’t wait to spend the week with you.”</p><p>Agatha tugged the corner of her lip between her teeth and pressed their cheeks together for a few seconds, before she whispered, “Call me when you leave, okay?”</p><p>“Okay, cariño.”</p><p>Rio pulled away then and found Agatha’s hand on her hip and took it to her lips just as Jen muttered, “Okay, Lancelot. Outta here.”</p><p>Rio grinned against the back of Agatha’s hand and let it go reluctantly to do as she was told and disappear off into the night. Only disappearing into the night wasn’t as easy as it used to be. It took them almost thirty minutes to get away from the people wanting one last shot at the Best Actress before she left.</p><p>Even Wanda tried to cajole her into staying.</p><p>But soon, Rio was striding into her little house in the hills with her Oscar held high in the air.</p><p>“Yesssssss!” She shout-whispered, only at the last second remembering that her parents were asleep up the stairs.</p><p>Alice laughed as she surveyed her friend from the door. “Plenty of water, babe. Go to bed. I’ll see you in a week.”</p><p>Rio turned on the spot, “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, Rio. Proud of you.”</p><p>And Alice was gone.</p><p>Rio stood in the twilight dark entrance of her home bought with the first movie star paycheck she’d ever earned, clutching the trophy that meant her whole life was about to change. But she remained, as ever, all alone.</p>

<h4>Monday</h4><p>The morning after the night before felt like a dream. She had won an Oscar. She’d won a <em>fucking</em> Oscar.</p>
<p>And if it weren’t for said Oscar now sitting pride of place on her bedside cabinet, glinting at her in the bright morning sun, she might not have believed it.</p>
<p>She reached to touch it, just able from her current position in the bed, to poke his knees. He was as handsome as ever. Though Rio, in her slight sleep-and-success-induced haze thought he looked just a little smug.</p>
<p>But then surely anyone who had been inside Agatha <em>fucking</em> Harkness looked smug.</p>
<p>The next thing she saw was her phone. Lying still and silent, she was almost tricked into thinking everyone who’d ever had her number hadn’t blown - and continued to blow - it up since her name had been read from that shiny gold envelope.</p>
<p>But she scrolled through the noise and found the name she was looking for.</p>
<p>Agatha had text her just once that morning. But unlike her usual texts, she’d included three photos with it.</p>
<p>She opened the first. There she was, wrapped up in Agatha’s arms, grinning at the camera. There she was again, in the second, smiling at Agatha, beaming at the woman beaming at her. And the third photo, the one that made her sleepy-warm glow morph into something other, something brighter, something sadder.</p>
<p>The last photo was of her, Agatha, and Nicky. And Rio saw Agatha’s son through the eyes of everyone else. He <em>did</em> look like her, and they <em>did</em> look like a family.</p>
<p>The text that came alongside the pictures was simple. It eased the churning of her stomach.</p>
<p>6:45am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Good morning, Academy Award Winner Rio Vidal. For your lock screen.</p>
<p>Rio chewed her lip, hesitated for a second before she opened safari on her iPhone. She ignored the fact that her last google was ‘how to remove coffee stain from clothes’ and instead googled ‘Agatha Harkness’. Which she’d also googled, according to her suggestions, recently.</p>
<p>What should have been a thirty second job now became a ten minute deep dive into some of the photoshoots and candid shots that existed on the - miraculously free of charge - internet for people like Rio to spend their time admiring.</p>
<p>And she’d have paid a king’s ransom annually to have access to such a treasure trove.</p>
<p>But she was looking for one in particular.</p>
<p>She found it. She screenshot it. She set it as her lock screen. She screenshot that. She sent it to Agatha.</p>
<p>8:47am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Actually, I already have a pretty good lock screen. Thanks though</p>
<p>She grinned as she locked her phone again, only to tap it to see the new image staring back at her. It was of Agatha from a photoshoot for MIAMI magazine, draped in a silky red dress, her legs spread open and her chest bare for the deep v-neck of the silk. She was scrunching her hair with one hand, the other resting confidently on her knee.<br/>
She looked powerful, magnificent, other-worldly.</p>
<p>Rio had seen it when it first came out and had stared at it for longer than she cared to admit. But now she had kissed that chest, she’d mapped it with her tongue. She’d knelt between those legs and she’d worshipped Agatha the way she deserved to be worshipped.</p>
<p>And so now the image of Agatha Harkness sat on her phone, ready to be admired whenever she went to pick it up.</p>
<p>But she didn’t pick it up again until much later that day; after her mom had made a feast of a breakfast and she’d played pick-up with her dad until he physically couldn’t take it anymore, and Rio laughed at his insistence he was having a heart attack whilst he continued to try and beat his daughter. Then they had lunch, and then, as she got ready to leave for their dinner reservation, she saw Agatha’s response.</p>
<p>8:52am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: A two year old photoshoot? Honey.</p>
<p>6:37pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: It’s hot</p>
<p>6:45pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Are you out for dinner?</p>
<p>6:47pm<br/>
Rio Vidal: leaving soon</p>
<p>6:48pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: Call me when you leave tomorrow.</p>
<p>When Rio and her parents got back that night, all appropriately full and warm from their meal, Rio curled up in the armchair and waited for her parents to go to bed before she took herself off too.</p>
<p>Finally alone she packed her bag, filling it with nothing but warm sweaters and her nicest lingerie.</p>
<p>She filled, too, a smaller bag, one she definitely didn’t want her parents to see. It was a backpack that had been a wrap gift from a movie she’d been in years ago. In this one she added a things for Agatha’s eyes only and with a full belly, and a fuller heart, she crawled into bed.</p><h4>Tuesday</h4><p>“Rio Vidal,” Agatha’s voice came through the tinny speaker of Rio’s little hybrid and the whole car seemed to light up with it - as if Agatha’s magic worked on motorised vehicles as well as the general movie-going, internet-using population.</p>
<p>“Why’re you full-naming me? Am I in trouble?”</p>
<p>“Do you want to be?”</p>
<p>Rio laughed, flicking the indicator as she moved to merge, “Only if the punishment matches the crime.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure that can be arranged.”</p>
<p>“Why are you calling, Agatha Harkness?”</p>
<p>“For one, you didn’t call me when you left. And two, I was bored.”</p>
<p>“I was busy with my parents and trying to battle my way through traffic. I’m an hour in, with four-ish more to go.” Rio’s eyes flicked to the screen showing the time left to the destination. “I think the boredom is only going to get a lot worse.”</p>
<p>“Then entertain me.”</p>
<p>“You think you say ‘jump’ and I say ‘how high’?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed as she adjusted her speed a little, “Okay, well I suppose we can use this time to go over our itinerary.”</p>
<p>“I assumed it was mostly being naked and in bed.”</p>
<p>“Well, a lot of it <em>is</em> that but it’s also our first time away with just us so I wanted to make it special.”</p>
<p>“And how are you going to do that, Rio Vidal?”</p>
<p>“Call me by my full name one more time, Harkness, and I won’t share.”</p>
<p>“Call me Harkness again and I won’t be naked.”</p>
<p>“I guarantee you’ll have your clothes off within two minutes of my arrival.”</p>
<p>“Very cocky for a woman who drives a white Toyota and hogs the middle lane.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked, looked up in her rearview mirror and spotted Agatha’s Range Rover behind her.</p>
<p>“You ass.”</p>
<p>Rio indicated again and pulled into the left lane. “How long have you been behind me?”</p>
<p>“Clearly not checking your mirrors.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and looked over her shoulder as she saw Agatha pull level, and she caught a glimpse of her through the window.</p>
<p>“You’re such a dick.”</p>
<p>“Nice to see you too, honey.”</p>
<p>Agatha was grinning, her eyes back in the road. Rio scowled and faced forward again. “So you caught up with me. Are you trying to prove a point or something?”</p>
<p>“That you need a better car, and to check your mirrors.”</p>
<p>“My car is perfect. It’s compact and I can park anywhere and it has enough room in the trunk for everything I need and-…”</p>
<p>“And it’s slow and small and unsafe.”</p>
<p>As if to prove a point, Agatha’s car pulled ahead and she indicated to merge in front of Rio.</p>
<p>“I hardly have precious cargo in here. It’s just me.”</p>
<p>“You are precious. Get a better car.”</p>
<p>“Did you just call me precious?”</p>
<p>“I’m buying you a better car.”</p>
<p>“Agatha, you’re avoiding the question.”</p>
<p>“Maybe a G Wagon or something.”</p>
<p>“Agatha. Precious me wants you to answer the question.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to hang up now.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed, “No! No, don’t! Let’s change the subject. Plans for the week.”</p>
<p>“Right. What did you have in mind?”</p>
<p>“Well, a quiet dinner tonight. Then tomorrow as many orgasms as you can handle. Then Thurs-…”</p>
<p>“Can we pause on tomorrow’s plans?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Well… what exactly were you thinking?”</p>
<p>“Are you regretting not letting me ride with you?”</p>
<p>“Shut up. Tell me.”</p>
<p>“We have four more hours to go, are you sure you want to know?”</p>
<p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio smirked to herself as she changed lanes again.</p>
<p>“Maybe not.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed: “Okay, then Thursday I figured we could do a movie marathon or something, just get all cosy and relax. And Friday I figure we can have a proper talk. About, well, about what we’re doing. It gives us a couple days to see if we’re compatible together before we do and on Saturday-…”</p>
<p>“Wait. Do you think we won’t be compatible?”</p>
<p>“No, I just mean-…”</p>
<p>“Are you worried you’ll be sick of me after-…”</p>
<p>“Agatha, no.” Rio glanced at the screen before focusing back on the road. She’d accidentally said the quiet part out loud. “I just mean it’s a different thing, being with someone for days and not just having a quick fuck of an evening and leaving the next morning. It’ll be nice. It’ll be <em>good</em> to be with you. Properly. You know that’s what I want.”</p>
<p>Rio had caught up to Agatha now and was putting her foot down to draw level with her. She glanced across and caught Agatha’s eye for a brief second. And then she rolled up her window and the slightly tinted glass meant Rio lost sight of her.</p>
<p>Rio sighed, feeling the heaviness of the silence. “It’ll just be good to talk.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Then on Saturday you’re going back to see Nicky and I’ll go for a hike or something.”</p>
<p>“Alone?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Then on Sunday I was planning on whipping out-…”</p>
<p>“Rio?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Do you wanna come and see Nicky with me?”</p>
<p>Rio almost crashed into the car in front. She braked just in time.</p>
<p>“What just happened?”</p>
<p>“I just-… really?”</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Pay attention.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I-… yeah, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>They were both silent for a little while and Rio glanced to see Agatha overtaking properly, her larger SUV powering along the highway.</p>
<p>“You did promise him you’d play basketball with him soon.”</p>
<p>Rio smiled a little and chewed on her lip, “Then, yeah. I’d like that.”</p>
<p>“I’ll drive us. That car and your driving… I don’t think I’d trust you to drive there and back in the same day.”</p>
<p>“I’m an excellent driver. You just took me by surprise, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be… good for you to spend the day with us. Maybe see what…”</p>
<p>“Agatha?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You realise that I love Nicky, right? I think he’s the best kid in the world.”</p>
<p>Agatha was silent for a while and then: “He loves you too.”</p>
<p>Rio began chewing on her lip, her gaze drifting to the back of Agatha’s car as she rode on ahead.</p>
<p>“I looked up those pap shots you mentioned to Jen. When she was being a bitch. The ones with your cousins? You <em>are</em> good with kids. It’s not just Nicky.”</p>
<p>“You looked them up?”</p>
<p>“I was curious.”</p>
<p>“Bit strange, isn’t it? Googling someone you know.”</p>
<p>“And please tell me how you got that new wallpaper on your phone?”</p>
<p>Rio grinned to herself and cleared her throat, deciding a change of subject would be the less embarrassing response.</p>
<p>“I have a very rambunctious little boy to try to win over for the shoot next week. So let’s see how good I am when running on barely any sleep and trying to help a kid remember his lines.”</p>
<p>“Have you met him?”</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t they pick a kid who looked like you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Apparently he’s a maniac though.”</p>
<p>“So he’s got your personality as well.”</p>
<p>“Very funny.”</p>
<p>“Just buy him milkshakes and annoy his mother. It worked on Nicky.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Did you want to spend the week with me? You realise you just asked to spend an extra ten hours trapped in a car with me too?”</p>
<p>“A sacrifice for the sake of my son.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit.”</p>
<p>“Best keep that language under control on set.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes, wondering suddenly how it was that she could no longer see Agatha’s car. Maybe she did need to buy a new car. A faster one.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me how to raise my fake kid.”</p>
<p>“I’m just warning you,” and Rio could hear the smugness in Agatha’s voice, “don’t bring that kinda language in front of <em>my</em> kid.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never sworn in front of Nicky.”</p>
<p>“You have, actually.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“In London. Outside the restaurant. And in my suite at the Oscars when trying to get a photo.”</p>
<p>“The first one wasn’t my fault. I was surprised. And pissed.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I’m just saying, a delightful Christmas movie about cancer can only be made worse by upsetting the kid every scene.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Did I upset Nicky?”</p>
<p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio smirked.</p>
<p>“Exactly. But that reminds me, you need to run lines with me.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“In exchange for every scene memorised I’ll give you one orgasm.”</p>
<p>“You better have a good memory.”</p>
<p>“You better be a good scene partner.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be the best you’ve ever had, Rio Vidal.”</p>
<p>“Oh I don’t doubt it, Harkness. Remind me who beat you to the Oscar this year though?”</p>
<p>“Some unknown actress. Charmed the right people, slept her way to the top.”</p>
<p>“I slept with you.”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“Suppose I did it for the Academy Award?”</p>
<p>“The fact that you’re planning a whole day in bed with me tomorrow suggests otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m playing the long game. Going Supporting for my little Christmas movie.”</p>
<p>“Has anybody won an Oscar for scenes where they’ll mostly be in sweaters with reindeer on them?”</p>
<p>“The fact that you spent a day in <em>my</em> house over Christmas suggests you <em>wanted</em> to see me in a reindeer sweater. Don’t be jealous I get to lounge around for months pretending it’s Christmas.”</p>
<p>“Nothing to be jealous of.”</p>
<p>“Not even Wanda?”</p>
<p>Rio’s gaze that had been previously trained on the road ahead flickered to the screen bearing Agatha’s name and the call time on it. Agatha was silent, Rio held her breath.</p>
<p>“I’m not jealous of Wanda.”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows and began to breathe again, “That’s new.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I’ve just realised that I have nothing to be jealous of.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed, “Okay, Agatha.”</p>
<p>“We never did cover off what you wanted to do tomorrow. <em>Exactly</em> what you wanted to do.”</p>
<p>Oh, Agatha was jealous. So jealous she couldn’t talk about it.</p>
<p>Rio grinned as she said: “I think I’ll let you imagine.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather you didn’t.”</p>
<p>“I thought you didn’t want to know.”</p>
<p>“My imagination might be worse.”</p>
<p>Rio gripped the wheel a little harder, her smile gone.</p>
<p>“Tell me how.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Agatha.”</p>
<p>“See? Two can play at that game.”</p>
<p>“You’re getting back at me for bringing up my Christmas wife.”</p>
<p>She heard Agatha scoff down the line. “Christmas wife.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned, “But before I get my Christmas wife I have a Berkeley Babe to enjoy.”</p>
<p>“Never call me that again.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s hideous.”</p>
<p>“California Cuddle Monster?”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to make me ram your car?”</p>
<p>“I can’t even see you anymore.”</p>
<p>“You need a new car.”</p>
<p>“And you’re going to buy me one, mami?”</p>
<p>Rio regretted it the moment she said it and she sucked in a breath as her eyes flickered to the seconds ticking along on the screen.</p>
<p>Ten of them went by.</p>
<p>“<em>Better</em>.”</p>
<p>Rio continued to hold her breath because Agatha’s one word response wasn’t something she felt she could handle when she had hours left to drive.</p>
<p>So they sat in silence for a while, with Rio eventually deciding that in order to drive she also had to breathe. She released her breath and tried to return her heart rate back to normal.</p>
<p>Rio glanced at the screen again and almost veered off the road when she realised that five minutes had passed and neither of them had said anything. She cleared her throat quickly and said awkwardly into the car: “When was the last time you took a trip? Without Nicky, I mean. And Ralph.”</p>
<p>“Only for work.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try my best not to make it feel like work then.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you just ask me to run lines with you?”</p>
<p>“In exchange for orgasms. Do you usually do that?”</p>
<p>“Only when my scene partner is appealing.”</p>
<p>“Not funny.”</p>
<p>“Now who’s jealous?”</p>
<p>Rio scoffed and shook her head, “I’m not a jealous person.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you said you wanted to kill my husband.”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> is different.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed, “I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have anyone else’s ring on my finger.”</p>
<p>“My fingers are ringless, honey.”</p>
<p>“Symbolically, then.”</p>
<p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio checked the screen to make sure the connection was still up. “Something to discuss this week.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>They fell into silence for almost ten minutes until Agatha broke it again, just as Rio was starting to spiral.</p>
<p>“Maybe we can talk tonight? I’d rather… let’s talk tonight.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked. She stared. She glanced at the screen on her dash and then looked back up to the road ahead of her.</p>
<p>“Rio?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m here.”</p>
<p>“So, get in, throw our stuff down, grab some food, and talk.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay.”</p>
<p>“You don’t sound thrilled, honey.”</p>
<p>“No. I’m just… surprised.”</p>
<p>She heard Agatha clear her throat and for a second she thought she would change her mind but instead Agatha said: “I’ll make dinner. You pour the wine. We can talk.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I kinda wish you’d picked somewhere closer so we didn’t have to drive all this way.”</p>
<p>“We’ll have six days where we don’t have to be anywhere or do anything for anyone.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned and chewed on the corner of her lip for a second. “Sounds like heaven.”</p>
<p>They were silent for a while, and then Rio began to talk again. She began to turn the conversation around for no reason other than because she was suddenly free to. Free to chat to Agatha because she had a whole week with her, which meant not every moment had to be heavy, or rushed.</p>
<p>So now, now she could complain about the lack of investment in the roads of California. She could ask Agatha how she ever got parked in her huge SUV. She could tease her about not having brought Agatha’s best friend - Oscar - because she’d thoroughly disinfected it and given it to her mom and dad to keep.</p>
<p>Agatha, throughout this, seemed to relax too. Rio had Miguel’s easy charm and ability to spin a yarn and Agatha clearly <em>was</em> charmed and was clinging onto her every word.</p>
<p>By the time Rio made it to the foothills of Berkeley she had to stop yapping to concentrate. And only one thing jolted her from her mission to find their home for the week: “I’ve just arrived.”</p>
<p>Rio glanced at the maps on her console and raised her brows. Agatha was somehow twenty minutes ahead of her. She thought she’d made up the time.</p>
<p>“I’m twenty minutes away,” Rio said with a frown, trying to concentrate. “I’ll see you soon.”</p>
<p>“Drive safe.”</p>
<p>The line cut. But not before Rio saw that they’d been talking, or at least had the line open, for over four hours.</p>
<p>She began chewing on her lip as she followed google maps closely now, winding through the streets of Berkeley’s hills.</p>
<p>She drove slowly past little cottages and glass monstrosities that sat in the hillside. Each house looked totally unlike the next and Rio couldn’t begin to guess what Agatha had rented for them.</p>
<p>A movement on her maps told her to turn up the next road and so she followed the curve of the hill until she was pulling up to a heavyset gate halfway along the cul-de-sac. She paused outside it, looking up at it curiously.</p>
<p>Agatha had picked Berkeley, she’d said, because it was a quiet suburb and the hills provided a protection no gates or high fences could provide. It was softer up here, as verdant and nature-filled as you could get in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And despite the drive, despite the hours of having only Agatha’s voice for company, Rio was grateful to her for her choice.</p>
<p>She made to get out the car - and her legs were pleased for it. They felt stiff and heavy as she turned her body to slide out. But the gate was already opening. Agatha knew she was here. She turned back to reverse and slowly drove in.</p>
<p>The house before her was more modern than she was expecting. It was white and square, all clean lines and box windows. Agatha’s car was parked in front of a two-door garage and Rio pulled up beside it.</p>
<p>She took a breath, inhaled slowly through her nose and out through her mouth. She was where she wanted to be. With Agatha. Alone with Agatha.</p>
<p>In the footwell beside her were the flowers she’d had as her companions for the trip. They sat in a bag of water and Rio dipped to pick them up.</p>
<p>Once her legs were on solid ground she stretched them, feeling the strain of the journey in her thighs as she picked up her larger bag from the trunk.</p>
<p>The trunk shut with a satisfying <em>thud</em> and Rio turned to what would become a core memory for years to come.</p>
<p>It was Agatha. Waiting for her, watching silently. There she stood, eyeing Rio with a kind of familiar curiosity. Her hands were tucked behind her back and she leant against the door frame. Her hair was back in a loose bun and she wore a deep navy sweater, light blue jeans, and bare feet.</p>
<p>Rio would have driven several more hours without stopping just to see her like this again.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said a little dumbly from where she still stood by the car.</p>
<p>“What took you so long?”</p>
<p>Rio grinned and watched as Agatha caught it. “Are you coming in?”</p>
<p>Adjusting the strap of her trusty leather duffel, the one that Alice wouldn’t let her take on work trips, Rio moved closer to her.</p>
<p>She held her bag by the handle over her shoulder and shrugged it on more as blue eyes fell to the flowers Rio was now holding out. “M’lady.”</p>
<p>“You bought me flowers?”</p>
<p>“Real ones this time.”</p>
<p>Agatha released her hands from behind her back and took the bouquet. “You’re a romantic, Rio Vidal.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed as she motioned with her head for Rio to come inside. It felt normal, almost frighteningly so, to just arrive home to a smiling, waiting Agatha.</p>
<p>Rio watched her for a few seconds as she led her in, checking her out secretly behind her back, and she closed the door behind them as Agatha continued on. But now she’d turned her attention from Agatha to the house they were to make home for the week. And she knew immediately why Agatha had picked it.</p>
<p>The living space was open plan. And directly in front of the entrance was the living room with all its pristine soft furnishings and a log fire built into the wall. But that wasn’t the reason. Beyond that, past the dining table, there was a wall of glass leading to a large balcony and the most impressive view of the hills Rio had seen.</p>
<p>The glow over the distant bay was almost as breathtaking as the woman who’d secured it for them.</p>
<p>“God, that view.”</p>
<p>“You like it?”</p>
<p>Agatha walked her through to the kitchen, around the corner from the entrance way in the open space. But Rio walked straight to the glass doors and dropped her bag by them. The sun was just setting and the sky was coloured with oranges and pinks which turned the landscape into a watercolour.</p>
<p>Just as Rio was about to search for the handle to step into it, she felt hands on her hips. “Can the view wait just a second?”</p>
<p>Agatha’s hold changed as Rio turned and she found Agatha wasn’t smiling like she had been before. She looked serious, almost annoyed.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Rio searched Agatha’s face for any indication as to what had happened. But she was unable to read her, unable to figure out what had changed between Rio arriving and now.</p>
<p>“Mi amor,” Rio breathed, frowning as she raised her hands to hold Agatha’s face. And suddenly, Agatha was smiling, was turning her head into Rio’s left palm, was kissing her there and grinning against her skin.</p>
<p>Rio narrowed her eyes and huffed quietly as Agatha pressed her back into the glass.</p>
<p>“Goddamn actress,” she muttered even as Agatha laughed and launched at her to kiss along her jaw and down her neck. “Shouldn’t be allowed to-,” she gasped as Agatha opened her mouth against her throat and she felt her tongue against her skin.</p>
<p>“Tease,” she managed to get out as Agatha pulled back up and pressed their lips together for the first time since the night of the Oscars. But Agatha wasn’t being delicate like she had to be then. She was firmer this time, safe in the knowledge that they didn’t have to hide anything from anyone.</p>
<p>Rio was moaning before she knew what was happening, because Agatha was clearly making up for lost time, for having to be quiet and delicate and patient.</p>
<p>They parted panting, both incapable of pulling away enough to actually be able to breathe properly. Rio’s hands were still tangled wantonly in Agatha’s hair and Agatha’s hands were spread across Rio’s torso, one pressing between her shoulder blades, the other against her lower back.</p>
<p>“A week of this?” Rio breathed out, her chest heaving against Agatha’s. “Fuck. You’ll kill me.”</p>
<p>Agatha before her looked different somehow. Perhaps it was the early-evening sun. Perhaps it was the pent up frustration of not being able to get to Rio for hours. Perhaps it was that she felt as relieved as Rio did that they could be themselves, together.</p>
<p>Agatha’s grin was slow to built but soon was spread across her face as she leant in to tug at Rio’s lower lip with her teeth and released only when Rio whimpered quietly. “Then we’ll die together.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed a soft, breathy chuckle and soothed her bottom lip with her tongue before she leant up and nudged their noses together affectionately. She smiled as Agatha leant in to kiss her again and her right hand slid down to her ass.</p>
<p>“You’ll give the neighbours a show.”</p>
<p>“No one can see. Don’t you think I made sure of that?”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows and smiled more widely, watching closely as Agatha kept her gaze down on her lips. “Did you have plans to do something you wouldn’t want anyone else to see?”</p>
<p>“You’re the one with the itinerary.”</p>
<p>“You make it sound so dull.”</p>
<p>“It’s a little anal.”</p>
<p>“Now <em>there’s</em> an activity from the list.”</p>
<p>Agatha blinked and Rio laughed as a rapid blush crept up her cheeks and she raised her gaze to Rio’s teasing eyes. “Oh?”</p>
<p>Agatha moved her left hand down to join her right on Rio’s ass and squeezed her there.</p>
<p>“You got it,” Rio baited, “that’s where-…”</p>
<p>“Stop talking or I’ll move it up the itinerary.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed properly this time, Agatha’s scowl only increasing the volume. “What happened to dinner and talking?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather kissing and-“</p>
<p>“Schtupping?”</p>
<p>“That’s it.”</p>
<p>And Rio laughed harder as Agatha began to wrestle her around, forcing her to relinquish her hold on her head and pinning her up against the window as she did. But she only managed it because Rio was vibrating with laughter and had allowed Agatha to win the fight.</p>
<p>“Agatha!” Rio continued to laugh as Agatha became more firm in her hold on Rio, her right hand now groping her left breast and her left hand sliding beneath her sweater to rest over her stomach. She was nudging her hair out of the way to press in against her neck as Rio supported herself against the window with her fingers splayed on the glass. Her laughter died on a gasp as Agatha nudged successfully through her hair and kissed the sensitive skin of her pulse point.</p>
<p>But her ferocity had slowed to something entirely different. She still held her close, unyielding in the pressure of her body against her back, but she was nuzzling in now, and Rio swallowed thickly as she adjusted their weight and cautiously reached a hand back to scratch at Agatha’s scalp as she kept her face buried against her neck.</p>
<p>“I’ve missed you.”</p>
<p>The words were barely a whisper, but Rio felt them seep below her skin and swim delicately around her heart. She turned her head more into Agatha and closed her eyes, her previously racing heart hammering a different rhythm in her chest, one that was slower but no less heavy.</p>
<p>“Yo también te extrañé, mi amor.” <em>I missed you too, my love.</em></p>
<p>Agatha’s hands began to move then and Rio rested her head back as the brunette began to paint her neck with her lips.</p>
<p>A soft gasp fell from her own as Agatha pushed her fingers below the waistband of her leggings and she groaned and threw her hand back against the glass as Agatha’s fingers danced their way down beneath her underwear.</p>
<p>“God,” Rio’s pulse was back to thunderous again. Her skin felt like it was on fire and all she could feel was the hand that squeezed her breast, the lips that were marking her neck, the long fingers now scissoring around her clit, making her hips stir desperately when Agatha had only just begun to touch her.</p>
<p>Rio began groan and she felt Agatha smile against her throat, her tongue tracing a slow line up to her ear which she soon had between her teeth.</p>
<p>“¿Te gusta así?” <em>Do you like it like this?</em> Agatha’s lips were against her ear, her breath hot and her voice husky, lower than even it usually was when she spoke Spanish and it made Rio moan quietly and turn her head into her.</p>
<p>“Sí.”</p>
<p>“¿Sí? ¿Estás seguro?” <em>Yes? You’re sure?</em></p>
<p>Rio laughed breathily and nodded, soon biting down on her lip as her elbows gave out and Agatha pressed her harder into the glass window.</p>
<p>“Dime.” <em>Tell me.</em></p>
<p>“Agatha, <em>por favor</em>.”</p>
<p>Agatha was rubbing tight circles over her clit now, applying just enough pressure to drive Rio wild. Just as Rio was closing her eyes, Agatha twisted her hand, replacing her fingers with her thumb and sliding her fingers until they pressed against her entrance, letting Rio know they were there.</p>
<p>“Pídemelo.” <em>Ask me for it.</em></p>
<p>Rio groaned and tried to rock her hips down onto Agatha’s waiting fingers but she wouldn’t give in, and instead simply pressed her face back into Rio’s neck and pushed her tongue against her pulse point.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Rio gasped, her hips still seeking what Agatha wouldn’t give her. “Quiero que me cojas.” <em>I want you to fuck me.</em></p>
<p>Agatha was smirking. She could feel it against her skin, feel the promise of her teeth on her neck as she did.</p>
<p>“Agatha,” Rio huffed, feeling the woman pressed against her nip against her throat.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Agatha breathed out against her skin, and Rio could hear her smile around the word, drawing out the two syllables. She nipped her skin again and made Rio groan once more just as she pressed her middle finger slowly inside of her.</p>
<p>“Fuuuuck,” Rio gasped out, rocking her hips down towards Agatha’s hand as Agatha fucked her slowly, now sucking harshly at her pulse point.</p>
<p>Agatha shifted her hand again to get more leverage and the heel of her hand pressed down against Rio’s clit and Rio’s hips became more insistent, and just as her groaning was picking up Agatha moved her other hand down to slip below her sweater and she felt her warm hand against her skin. Agatha grabbed at her breast and Rio rolled her head back into Agatha’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Déjame oírte.” <em>Let me hear you.</em></p>
<p>Agatha pressed her forefinger inside of her and made Rio moan louder than she had been before. And she rewarded her by curling her fingers inwards and fucking her harder against the window.</p>
<p>Rio’s arms gave out entirely and Agatha pressed her closer, knocking her ankle out further to give her more room. Rio was getting louder, and Agatha encouraged it, pinching and rolling her nipple between her fingers. Rio arched her chest into her, her mind blank of any thought other than Agatha as she fucked her and marked her neck.</p>
<p>The glass before her was steaming up with her warm cheek and hot breath against it. Rio’s hands felt clammy, the heat of her skin against the cool window making it harder to keep their positioning. But Agatha was fierce as she fucked her, giving her more the louder Rio was.</p>
<p>She twisted her hand to replace the heel of her hand with her thumb again and Rio almost screamed when she pressed it against her clit, the pressure making her orgasm build so suddenly in her lower abdomen that it crashed over her with little warning.</p>
<p>Agatha slowed her assault on her, continuing to fuck her gently now, riding her through it as Rio’s thighs began to quake. She was tired, she’d been thinking about Agatha all day, constantly wondering in the back of her mind how long it would be until she could kiss her, taste her.</p>
<p>Agatha’s thumb moved, seeking her clitoral hood to press over Rio’s clit with it, providing a softer comedown that made Rio whine a little until she slid her hand down and grasped Agatha’s wrist.</p>
<p>“Basta, mi amor. Basta.” <em>Enough.</em></p>
<p>She felt Agatha press her smile against her, felt her nuzzle into her.</p>
<p>“Welcome home.” Agatha whispered the words against Rio’s ear as Rio began to laugh. It was slow at first, ragged and low with her breathing. But it grew as she felt Agatha grin as she kissed behind her ear. The hand on her breast moved down and her fingers splayed over her diaphragm as her laughter got louder.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio gasped out, “Fucking me against a window.”</p>
<p>Agatha nipped at the shell of her ear, making Rio’s breath hitch and she pulled back to encourage Rio to turn, slipping her hand from her leggings to rest against her hip as Rio turned back.</p>
<p>Agatha’s hands were hot against her skin and Rio’s cheeks were flushed and ruddy but she didn’t care. She’d burn for eternity if she had to. If she could only have this.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how that’s funny.”</p>
<p>But Agatha looked almost as dazed as she felt and she simply smiled against her cheek, having already pressed back when Rio had turned around, her hold firm but her voice gentle. Rio sucked in a breath, her laughter drifting away as she closed her eyes and focused on the tender pressure of Agatha still holding her against the window. “It’s funny because a few months ago the thought of you holding my hand during a photoshoot was enough to send me reeling.”</p>
<p>Agatha began to nudge at her jaw with the bridge of her nose, ghosting her lips back to her throat. “Things change.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed quietly, moving her hands to Agatha’s hair to hold her head up so she could look at her. Agatha’s lips were pouting and swollen and her eyes looked glazed over as she stared at Rio’s grin.</p>
<p>“How much of your drive was spent thinking about that?”</p>
<p>“Well you wouldn’t share your plans so I had to come up with some of my own.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned even wider, and Agatha’s dark blue eyes moved up to meet her own. And Rio decided she could live forever in the faint lines that appeared when Agatha smiled back at her.</p>
<p>“You <em>did</em> think about that on your drive?”</p>
<p>“I got a little bored when you were complaining about the lack of investment in interstate maintenance.”</p>
<p>Rio narrowed her eyes and Agatha grinned some more.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>wanting</em> me to return the favour?”</p>
<p>Rio kept her face unmoved as hands slid down to her ass and she only raised her brows as Agatha took a few seconds to respond: “Well, I’d never <em>demand</em> you did.”</p>
<p>“Only very unsubtly hint?”</p>
<p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio hummed into a soft kiss. When she pulled back she grinned and raised her brows, already making quick work of the button on Agatha’s jeans. “Try not to come so quickly this time.”</p>
<p>Agatha scoffed and Rio grinned as she pulled the zipper down and quickly slid her hand into Agatha’s underwear.</p>
<p>“Holy shit,” she uttered without meaning to, surprised by how wet Agatha already was.</p>
<p>But her fingers had barely begun, she was only just cupping Agatha, feeling her wetness practically pool in her palm when Agatha pushed Rio back and placed her hands either side of her head against the glass.</p>
<p>“You were <em>really</em> thinking about me in the car, huh?”</p>
<p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and Rio grinned when she rocked her hips down towards Rio’s hand. “Can you stop talking now?”</p>
<p>“A minute ago you wanted me-…” Agatha placed a hand over Rio’s mouth and Rio was initially shocked out of a reaction but soon she was grinned again and raised her brows in amusement as Agatha continued to scowl at her.</p>
<p>“What?” Agatha asked with a shrug, “I figured if you were quiet you might actually do something.”</p>
<p>Rio hummed, because that was all she could do. And Agatha raised her brows expectantly. But Rio didn’t give in so easily.</p>
<p>She luxuriated in the feel of Agatha so wet for her, and she hummed some more as she stroked lavishly through her pussy, not touching her anywhere she really wanted, instead just letting her know she had her exactly where she wanted her.</p>
<p>“Rio.”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to ask again.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded and paused her explorations and pulled her hand slowly out of Agatha’s pants.</p>
<p>Agatha looked wild. Horrified.</p>
<p>She stared as Rio took hold of Agatha’s wrist with her other hand and pulled it from her mouth only to replace it immediately.</p>
<p>She licked her soaked palm. A long, slow, deliberate lick from the heel of her hand to the tip of her fingers. The moan wasn’t planned, but it was loud and unashamed as the taste of Agatha took over her senses.</p>
<p>Agatha’s jaw had dropped, her eyes now black as she stared at what Rio had just done.</p>
<p>But Rio couldn’t enjoy her appetiser. Agatha was on her before she was even able to close her mouth again, to swallow down the taste of the woman.</p>
<p>The kiss was ferocious, and if Rio had any working neurones, she might have been worried for the window.</p>
<p>But soon her hand was back down Agatha’s pants, back where it belonged.</p>
<p>And she gave Agatha exactly what she wanted. So much so that Agatha lost the ability to kiss and was now moaning and gyrating, clutching at Rio desperately.</p>
<p>And Rio grinned as she tried to catch her breath, keeping her eyes on Agatha’s little ‘o’ shaped mouth as she concentrated on the expert hand working her up.</p>
<p>Agatha leant into her more fully, her mouth soon opening more as she moaned and raggedly panted into Rio’s open mouth. Her brow was furrowed, her eyes wide and dark, and Rio kept her pace steady now, gave just enough to keep Agatha tilting on the very edge.</p>
<p>She lifted her head, flicked her tongue out on the underside of Agatha’s upper lip, eliciting a soft moan. It felt better than she’d ever imagined to have Agatha this way, to have her whole body trembling because of the slow, deliberate movements of Rio’s practiced hand.</p>
<p>She felt powerful, blessed with the knowledge that no one before her had Agatha like this: open, vulnerable, <em>wanting</em>.</p>
<p>And when Agatha came, she came with soft moans into Rio’s mouth, her hips stuttering against her hand, her eyes closing and her brows knit together as she focused on the waves of pleasure Rio was conjuring for her.</p>
<p>“F-fuck, fuck.”</p>
<p>Rio eased her thumb slowly, letting Agatha ride it out until her hips began to still, but she didn’t pull out. She waited until Agatha came back to herself, pressed a slow, deliberate kiss to the corner of her lips, moved her left hand down to her neck.</p>
<p>“Otro,” <em>another</em>, Rio whispered as Agatha kissed her more squarely. Agatha nodded just once, and moved her other hand in to hold Rio’s head properly, angling it up as she murmured against her lips: “kiss me.”</p>
<p>Rio leant in but Agatha smiled and pulled back an inch, making Rio frown and hesitate.</p>
<p>“Kiss me,” Agatha repeated, her smile sharpening, her tone commanding.</p>
<p>Rio leant in again without hesitation and Agatha moved back once more, making Rio huff quietly, still frowning down at the smirk mere centimetres away from her. She curled her fingers more inside of Agatha and watched his lips twitch at the feel, felt her hips rock slowly.</p>
<p>“Are you going to let me? Or keep teasing?”</p>
<p>She lifted her thumb from where it had rested pressed beside Agatha’s swollen clit and allowed it to ghost over it once, twice, enjoying the sight of Agatha’s fluttering eyelashes as she tried to maintain her cool.</p>
<p>“Because with how fast you come, mi amor, by the time you’re done teasing… I’ll make you come so hard you’re seeing stars. And not just the one with her fingers buried inside you.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s blush deepened, making Rio grin. But she leant back in, brushed their lips together, smiled when Rio tried to kiss her properly but was denied, “Make me come and I’ll kiss you again.”</p>
<p>Who was Rio to deny the great Agatha Harkness. She could work for her kiss. She’d work forever for a kiss.</p>
<p>Rio pulled her fingers from her, only to then add a third and push in slowly, feeling Agatha adjust, clench, squeeze.</p>
<p>And Rio revelled in it. In being able to make Agatha gasp and twitch, her blue eyes obsidian now as she closed the gap between them and the kiss she’d been denied was now delivered to her lips, urgent, and desperate.</p>
<p>Rio short-circuited.</p>
<p>Rio Vidal, womaniser, self-confessed sex god, with an ego that made her generous in bed and arrogant enough to know that most women would always come back for more, <em>this</em> Rio Vidal, well she forgot who she was as Agatha broke her own rule and kissed her again.</p>
<p>Because she’d been ready to work for it.</p>
<p>And now Agatha was giving it to her practically for free.</p>
<p>She moaned into Agatha’s mouth, unsure now where her tongue ended and Agatha’s began as the kiss became more aggressive.</p>
<p>Agatha’s teeth sank into Rio’s lower lip and Rio was shocked back into her own brain, shocked into fucking Agatha harder, into matching the pace of the kiss with the desperation of her hand working Agatha up as mercilessly as she could.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Agatha to break. And she did so beautifully, loudly, her fingers grasping and her mouth still seeking.</p>
<p>And Rio could barely breathe anymore, her hand aching, almost numb with the exertion. Her lips were swollen and sore, her back aching from the press of Agatha’s whole body weight against her into the glass, but it was all worth it, all so goddamn worth it.</p>
<p>When she pulled out, Agatha chased her fingers with her hips, groaning a little at the loss. But Agatha was no longer denying Rio anything. She continued to kiss her, pausing only so they could both breathe, their heavy breaths beating back and forth into each other’s mouths.</p>
<p>They remained like that a while, moored together by their hungry hands and hungrier mouths.</p>
<p>And Rio smiled into every kiss, waited impatiently for the next one, then the next, then the next.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t do this forever.</p>
<p>Agatha eventually made the executive decisions.</p>
<p>“Unpack,” Agatha murmured between kisses, her voice low, husky, “shower,” another kiss, “change,” another kiss, “come back,” another, “pour the wine.”</p>
<p>Rio smiled into each kiss, raising her brows when Agatha suddenly changed tact and placed a final, lingering kiss to her cheek. “And what will you do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll start on dinner. I’ll wait for you.”</p>
<p>Rio’s smile turned into a grin and she stole another quick kiss as Agatha began to pull away. She looked flushed, and Rio was pleased with what she saw. “Is this what it’s like to live with Agatha Harkness? Hot sex then a home cooked meal?”</p>
<p>“Only if you’re lucky.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed, “They don’t call me Rio the luckiest son of a bitch Vidal for nothing.”</p>
<p>“Actually they call you Rio incredibly irritating <em>Elena</em> Vidal.”</p>
<p>“How do you know my middle name?”</p>
<p>“I spent the day with your mom, remember?”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed as she watched Agatha grin and make her way to the kitchen. But Rio stayed where she was, simply enjoying the view. Agatha looked a little unsteady on her feet. “She better not have taken out the baby photos.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but she did.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed, shooting Rio a grin over her shoulder. Rio just shook her head and pushed from the window, glancing back out to the the setting sun. How ironic, she thought, that the day their relationship could finally begin, the day the sun would rise on it, they’d arrived to the sun setting.</p>
<p>She grabbed her bag and disappeared into the house. It turned out to be larger than even it looked on the outside. All white walls and large windows.</p>
<p>Down the hall there was a large bathroom off to the left with a sunken bath and a wall to ceiling view of the hills and water beyond. To the right was a smaller room clearly used as an office. Further down led to the stairs and beyond that was the first bedroom she’d come across, large and with that same impressive view.</p>
<p>Up the stairs there was another bathroom, a little smaller, and with less of a view. The bedroom closest to it was larger than the one below but Agatha’s bag wasn’t there so Rio continued in her search.</p>
<p>The third bedroom was where she found Agatha’s bag, a suitcase in fact, resting neatly against the far wall. The main bedroom had the same floor to ceiling windows as the living room but no balcony. Rio stopped to look at the view for just a few seconds before she turned to throw her bag on the bed and then disappeared into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Her body was surging with adrenaline as she stripped and stepped into the walk-in shower. She lathered herself with jojoba soap that boasted its organic spa origins and stood with her head angled down below the rainfall shower head.</p>
<p>The quiet of the bathroom, the water falling over her head, the soothing concoction of spa organic coconut shampoo now creating a creamy lather in her hair, allowed her to fantasise about the woman waiting for her in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Perhaps this week Agatha would see what <em>could</em> be, what they could have together. Perhaps she would turn around to welcome Rio back, inhale her spa-approved scent, and tell her she loved her, had been holding it back for reasons even she didn’t understand, but was ready now, was determined to say it as often as possible.</p>
<p>Then they’d eat a delicious meal, drink delicious wine, live deliciously together.</p>
<p>The fantasy dissolved as Rio rinsed herself and stepped from the shower but her heart was buoyed once she was wrapped in the fluffiest towel she’d ever felt against her skin. Maybe Agatha wouldn’t say all those things. But she had her for a week. And that was something to be cherished.</p>
<p>She dried herself and changed into a cream knitted sweater and sweats and towelled her hair until it was no longer dripping wet, and left it to dry naturally as she padded down back to Agatha, following the scent of a sofrito sizzling away on the stove.</p>
<p>Stopping by the partial wall dividing the living space from the kitchen, she leant against it, folded her arms over herself and simply watched.</p>
<p>Agatha had piled her hair back on top of her head in an impossibly chic bun, somehow salvaging it from the birds nest Rio had created for her earlier. She stood by the burner, gently prodding the sofrito mix in the pan. In the background an invisible speaker somewhere was playing some big band number that Rio knew but couldn’t name.</p>
<p>She watched as Agatha reached for the oil, watched as her pale fingers stretched out, empty of any sign that this woman didn’t belong to her.</p>
<p>It was enough impetus to move forwards and announce herself.</p>
<p>And she did so by placing a gentle kiss to Agatha’s exposed neck, squeezing her waist, as casual as breathing. “Red or white?”</p>
<p>“Your hair is wet,” Agatha accused as Rio pressed her face into the back of Agatha’s neck and snaked her arms around her.</p>
<p>“You’d deny me this?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s pretty clear I wouldn’t deny you anything.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned, a very happy memory flashing to her mind, “I didn’t bring Oscar, by the way. I cleaned him, thoroughly, gave him to my parents.”</p>
<p>She could almost feel Agatha roll her eyes and she continued to grin against her, as Agatha said: “You already told me that. I knew you’d keep bringing it up.”</p>
<p>“Bring what up, baby? The fact I fucked you with my Academy Award? That you wanted it so badly you <em>rode</em> it.”</p>
<p>“Irritating, see?”</p>
<p>Rio laughed, placing a final kiss to Agatha’s skin before she pulled away in search of wine. “Red or white?”</p>
<p>“Red. It goes better with the food.”</p>
<p>Rio hummed as she muttered to herself, “And your cheeks.”</p>
<p>“I heard that.”</p>
<p>Rio continued to grin as she sourced the selection of red, noticing without commenting, that a lot of it was Barolo. She picked one of a recent vintage, not knowing or caring much about what that really meant anyway, and found a corkscrew to open it.</p>
<p>“We have enough food for the week,” Agatha was saying, her attention still on her culinary efforts. “And the wine fridge is stocked. We shouldn’t need to leave.”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows as the cork popped out. “You worried I’ll run around town screaming about what we’re doing here?”</p>
<p>“No, just… wanted to make sure we had as much time together as possible.”</p>
<p>Rio started to look for glasses, eventually finding the cupboard they lived in. Her heart swelled in her chest. “Sounds ominous.”</p>
<p>“Rio.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Rio reassured, smiling a little as she poured. “I’m kidding. I want as much time with you as possible too.”</p>
<p>She went to place Agatha’s wine by her side and she leant around to smile at her, and saw that Agatha looked concerned, her lower lip tugged between her teeth.</p>
<p>“You know,” Rio said softly, “This crush of yours. On me.”</p>
<p>“More than a crush,” Agatha corrected quickly, and whether it was the heat from the pan or the impact of Rio’s earlier teasing, her cheeks and the tip of her nose <em>were</em> a little pink.</p>
<p>“Your more-than-a-crush,” Rio corrected, “it’s very sweet. I’m suspicious you’re a romantic.”</p>
<p>Agatha didn’t say anything and Rio just grinned, clinking their glasses together before she turned to lean back against the counter and sip her wine. She’d picked well. Or, Agatha had.</p>
<p>“This is nice. Doing domestic things with you. Just-…”</p>
<p>“Honey,” Agatha interrupted her, “Can you not commentate our whole week?”</p>
<p>“You’re uncomfortable with me telling you I’m enjoying myself?”</p>
<p>“I’m uncomfortable with you telling me-…”</p>
<p>“That all the boring things like cooking dinner, or even doing laundry, might be made tolerable because I’m doing them with you?”</p>
<p>Agatha glanced her way and Rio saw a hesitance in her gaze that was soon replaced by a smile as Agatha reached for her glass. “You’re such a-…”</p>
<p>“Romantic? Lover girl?”</p>
<p>“Loser.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed and Agatha grinned into her wine.</p>
<p>“Wait until we go public, you’ll see how much of a loser I really am.”</p>
<p>Rio ignored that Agatha’s smile had faded somewhat, ignored the tightening in her chest that it caused, focused on the fact that Agatha was now kissing her cheek, holding the spoon so Rio could take it.</p>
<p>“I’m going to shower. Keep an eye on this. When it’s softened, take it off the heat.”</p>
<p>Rio could only nod, only smile. It hadn’t been a denial, or a refusal, it had been simply been ignored. So as Agatha took her wine and walked away from her Rio turned to the task at hand, choosing to press down her anxiety and focus on what was in front of her - mixed vegetables and mixed signals.</p>
<p>Agatha had promised to talk. Tonight, in fact.</p>
<p>So Rio could wait a little longer, could simmer on the promise.</p>
<p>Now, Rio admittedly wasn’t the best cook, and also had a mind that delighted in distraction, in play, in anything that was more exciting than pushing softening onions, garlic, celery, around a pan. And so it didn’t take long for signs of burning to appear, for Rio to mutter ‘no no no’ as if a mantra would de-char the dinner.</p>
<p>By the time Agatha arrived back - skin annoyingly glowy again - Rio had finished her glass of wine and was chopping more vegetables in the hopes they could just start again. The pan was off the heat and to the side.</p>
<p>“Do I smell burning?”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t really be left in charge of-.”</p>
<p>But Rio lost her train of thought as Agatha wrapped her arms around her from behind and kissed her cheek. “We can pick out the worst bits and it’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Rio huffed and looked down at half the onion she’d already desecrated on the chopping board.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll just do the cooking and you stick to the wine.”</p>
<p>“I can make a mean grilled cheese,” Rio offered with a grin as she turned to Agatha. “And I’m surprisingly good at pie.”</p>
<p>“Pie?”</p>
<p>“Pie.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed as she moved away and went to salvage what she could. The smell was worse than the reality, and Rio left her attempts at correcting her mistake to top up the wine glasses again.</p>
<p>Soon she made herself useful by setting the table and lighting candles. Agatha sourced the rest of the ingredients and went about piecing them all together.</p>
<p>It was easy, homely. And Rio had to bite her tongue for fear she’d spoil it if she acknowledged how perfect it all felt to her - just moving around a kitchen with Agatha. She hadn’t felt like this since the last time she was home watching her parents dance around the kitchen together.</p>
<p>And with a twinge of longing she realised that she wanted Agatha there for it next time. She wanted Agatha in her kitchen, dancing alongside her, Nicky squashed between them, a makeshift, pieced together, <em>wished for</em> family.</p>
<p>To cover the silence caused by Rio’s refusal to break it and Agatha’s concentration on the food, Rio trimmed and arranged the flowers in a vase she found, soon displaying them on the dining table as a centre piece.</p>
<p>Eventually, when everything was in the oven they moved across to the table and Agatha held her glass up to cheers. “To never letting you cook.”</p>
<p>Rio pursed her lips but relented and cheersed to that, avoiding Agatha’s amused gaze. “You’re so smug.”</p>
<p>“What else are you bad at?”</p>
<p>Rio laughed as she sipped her wine, “Nothing. Just that.”</p>
<p>“Remembering names?”</p>
<p>“I-…” she narrowed her eyes at Agatha, “<em>Twice</em> you’ve caught me out on that. But I’m <em>actually</em> fine with names.”</p>
<p>“Right. What else? Let’s see… bad at driving.”</p>
<p>“Untrue. Your truck is just bigger than my car. You’re sizest.”</p>
<p>“So three things. I’m sure there are more.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and nudged Agatha with her foot, “And there’s nothing you’re bad at?”</p>
<p>Agatha raised her brows and smiled, but it didn’t meet her eyes, “Marriage, maybe.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s only because you have a husband.”</p>
<p>Agatha didn’t look away but she took a sip of her wine and Rio knew she was giving herself time to answer. “You think I’d be better with a wife?”</p>
<p>Rio grinned and watched as Agatha’s gaze dropped a few inches to look at it, “I think you’d prefer it, yes.”</p>
<p>Agatha hummed quietly and took another sip of her wine.</p>
<p>“Would you? Want to be married? To… someone other than Ralph?”</p>
<p>“Are you about to suggest buying me a bigger diamond again? I didn’t realise you were that drunk.”</p>
<p>Rio rolled her eyes and curled her right foot beneath her left thigh, “Stop avoiding the question.”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t really thought about it.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded slowly, and watched as Agatha turned her head to glance over at the clock on the wall, taking her time with it. She was lying.</p>
<p>“I have,” Rio said suddenly, making Agatha’s head whip round to her so quickly it almost made Rio laugh.</p>
<p>“Marriage?”</p>
<p>“Mmhm.”</p>
<p>“To-. I mean. You want that?”</p>
<p>Rio shrugged and tried to fight her smile again at the sight of Agatha so clearly struggling with asking what she wanted to ask.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I just tell you I was enjoying the domesticity?”</p>
<p>“And you’d want to… enjoy it with the state knowing?”</p>
<p>“With the world knowing, preferably.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded and took another sip of wine. When she was done, she placed her glass down and toyed idly with the stem. Rio watched as she thought hard about her next question: “Have you ever been close?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Rio shifted a little and blue eyes darted to her at the sudden movement.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t met anyone I’d consider proposing to.”</p>
<p>Agatha bit the corner of her lip and Rio waited patiently to see what she’d say.</p>
<p>“Have you now?”</p>
<p>“I <em>did</em> help a pretty woman with her bags today at the airport. Seemed like she’d be wife material.”</p>
<p>“Very funny.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned and watched Agatha reach for the wine bottle. “Are you asking me if I’d want to marry you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Agatha placed the bottle down after filling only her own glass.</p>
<p>“Good because a bigger ring than the one you already have would be expensive.”</p>
<p>Agatha exhaled a humourless scoff and Rio made a show of stealing the wine to fill her own glass.</p>
<p>“Besides,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio looked up as she placed the bottle down, but forgot how to work her fingers to release it when she caught the intensity of Agatha’s gaze, “You need to make sure we’re compatible first.”</p>
<p>Rio pursed her lips, watching as Agatha raised her brows arrogantly at her, as if she’d just won the war on ‘who wants to marry who’. “You know that isn’t what I meant.”</p>
<p>“I believe you meant you wanted to see if you could tolerate me.”</p>
<p>Rio knew when she was being baited. She <em>also</em> knew that Agatha was distracting her from the topic of marriage because the topic of marriage was a reminder of He Who Must Not Be Named.</p>
<p>And something else in Agatha’s tone told her that besides the <em>other</em> thing she’d been thinking about in the car, she’d probably been thinking about this too.</p>
<p>“You’re being pretty <em>in</em>tolerable now…”</p>
<p>Agatha smirked and shrugged as she sipped her wine, “Take me or leave me.”</p>
<p>“I believe I <em>took</em> you earlier. Twice.”</p>
<p>“So irritating.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned and moved suddenly to stand beside Agatha’s chair and softened when she looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>She asked the question as Rio slipped sideways into her lap, and in doing so made Agatha frown deeply, though her free arm was already wrapping itself around Rio’s hips.</p>
<p>“I figure if I literally hold your face you can’t look away.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>Rio nodded seriously, holding said face gently in her warm hands. Blue eyes were wide, observant rather than surprised now and Rio smiled at the sight, at the lips that had slightly parted, the pupils that seemed to slowly dilate the longer she sat there.</p>
<p>“I don’t tolerate you. I <em>love</em> you. When I said earlier about compatibility, I really meant to see if <em>you</em> would be comfortable spending a whole week with <em>me</em>. Because a little part of me thinks that maybe…”</p>
<p>And Agatha began to frown. She moved her other arm to hold Rio in place properly.</p>
<p>“Maybe sneaking around and the secrecy is part of the appeal and-…”</p>
<p>“It’s not. Rio. It’s not. I hate that. I hate-.” But Agatha’s closed her eyes and sighed heavily, taking a second as Rio’s hold on her face dropped to her shoulders instead. She looked up again.</p>
<p>“It’s not, Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded slowly, brushing her hands along to rest around Agatha’s throat. “Okay, I know. It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“We’re compatible,” Agatha insisted a little more firmly this time. “Even if you’re irritating.”</p>
<p>Rio blinked, took a second to process Agatha’s words, and as she saw a smile grow up her face she laughed with it, making to slip off of Agatha’s lap even as she was dragged back and Agatha began to laugh too.</p>
<p>“Bitch!”</p>
<p>And then Rio barked a laugh as Agatha jabbed at her side and Rio tried to push her arms from around her. But Agatha held on tight. And to Rio’s surprise and delight, she bit at her shoulder, opening her mouth wide and surely getting a mouthful of wool just to make Rio feel her teeth.</p>
<p>Rio laughed some more and pulled away, worried suddenly for her lungs as well as the red wine on the table and her white sweater.</p>
<p>“This is an expensive sweater!”</p>
<p>Agatha snorted and Rio stopped immediately, turning to her with a delighted grin. “What was that?”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Did you just snort?”</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed. “Agatha Harkness snorts? A real, true <em>snort</em>? I’ve heard little ones from you before but…”</p>
<p>“Off. Get off me.”</p>
<p>Rio laughed some more as she was forced to her feet and she span around immediately to smile at Agatha. “So. Two things I’ve learned about you recently: you snort <em>and</em> you wear glasses. The latter I’m <em>very</em> excited to see in real life.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t bring them,” Agatha uttered as she grabbed her wine to go and check on the food, her cheeks a little more pink than they had been previously.</p>
<p>“You must have.”</p>
<p>Rio grabbed her own wine to follow her through, absolutely not willing to give up on this. “So if I went through your bag I wouldn’t find any?”</p>
<p>“I’d have you arrested.”</p>
<p>“For what? Snooping?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’d claim you were looking for underwear or something because you’re a pervert.”</p>
<p>Agatha bent down and Rio took full advantage by slapping her ass as she moved past to lean against the counter.</p>
<p>“911,” Agatha trilled after jumping a little. “I have an actress here who-…”</p>
<p>“Academy Award winning actress.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure the penal code of California gives any grace to Oscar winners.”</p>
<p>“They will when I tell them where it’s been.”</p>
<p>“If I’d known you wouldn’t shut up about that I’d never have let you do it.”</p>
<p>Rio grinned as Agatha came to stop before her and immediately slipped her hands around to hold her ass, pulling their hips flush.</p>
<p>“I <em>love</em> that you let me.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Agatha thought for a second. “Did you… bring anything else that might be… explored?”</p>
<p>Rio’s smile widened a little even as Agatha avoided her gaze, now staring somewhere close to her midriff.</p>
<p>“I might have.”</p>
<p>Agatha was silent and still and Rio’s smile faded a little as she observed the thoughts visible across Agatha’s face. “Maybe I can show you them if you show me your glasses?”</p>
<p>Blue eyes flashed up then and Rio’s smile returned as Agatha tightened her grip on her, “Maybe.”</p>
<p>“Tit for tat or no tat.”</p>
<p>“Oh I’m tit?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled just a little and Rio turned to place her wine safely on the side. “You know…”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Agatha leant in to rest her forehead against Rio’s temple. Rio sighed and wrapped her arms loosely around her neck, “Tomorrow we have more time together than we’ve ever had before.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled a little and dragged her hands back around to Rio’s front, sliding them slowly beneath her sweater to splay across her abdomen and curl her fingers around her ribs. “Good job you have your little itinerary to hand.”</p>
<p>“And tomorrow’s schedule is keeping you naked all day.”</p>
<p>Agatha laughed and Rio grinned, tugging Agatha a little closer with her arms around her still. “I’m sure it won’t take much convincing.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it would.”</p>
<p>Agatha kissed her then and Rio grinned into it, her back bending over the counter with the force of Agatha’s enthusiasm. Agatha relented only so they could breathe and even then she wasted no time trying to catch her breath and instead journeyed her lips along Rio’s jaw, until she hit her throat and she added her tongue to tease at the sensitive skin there.</p>
<p>“Agatha. Agatha… gently. I have to film. I’m filming soon.”</p>
<p>Agatha huffed a hot breath against her skin and Rio laughed which made Agatha raise her head up. “You already have a bruise on the other side.”</p>
<p>“Yes but I don’t want any <em>more</em>.”</p>
<p>Agatha rolled her eyes but Rio pushed her back, turned them slowly around. “However, you’re not shooting next week so I can-…”</p>
<p>But just as she was leaning in Agatha stopped her, frowning. “Rio. Ralph.”</p>
<p>Rio stopped, blinked, horrified that for the smallest of seconds she’d forgotten the husband. She stepped back, a little shell-shocked and Agatha reached for her arms. “Hey. You okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I just forgot.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded and something in her gaze told Rio that she’d forgotten him too, until now at least. “Why don’t you go sit? Food’s almost done anyway.”</p>
<p>Rio smiled and pulled away. Remembering her wine at the last second she grabbed that too and went to sit down. She topped her glass up again and by the time she’d forced herself to stop thinking about breaking a certain someone’s jaw Agatha was bringing over the pot of food and placing it on the heatproof mat Rio had laid out earlier.</p>
<p>“Fuck that smells so-…” Rio paused as she peered over the edge of the dish and looked properly at what they would be eating. “Is that…?”</p>
<p>“Pollo guisado.”</p>
<p>“That’s my-…”</p>
<p>“Favourite. I know.”</p>
<p>Rio felt her cheeks flush suddenly but why she felt so embarrassed she didn’t know. “You made me my favourite?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>And Rio turned to Agatha and sat in stunned silence as Agatha stood and busied herself with serving. She looked at ease, unmoved by Rio’s incomprehension, focused instead on piling the plates with a meal Rio hadn’t had since she was last home.</p>
<p>“My mom told you,” Rio eventually deduced, her brain kicking into gear again as Agatha placed her bowl down before her on the placemat.</p>
<p>“Your dad, actually.”</p>
<p>Agatha sat down and Rio reached to tug her chair around some more which made Agatha look at her with a wry smile that Rio was soon leaning over to kiss away. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Agatha sighed against Rio’s mouth, and kissed her again, her hand moving to hold the back of Rio’s head so they could rest together for a minute. “You’re welcome. If it tastes burnt…”</p>
<p>Rio grinned and Agatha grinned back, eventually letting go so they could both eat.</p>
<p>It had happened so easily. They’d fallen into a domestic reality that was far better that any of Rio’s fantasies. Agatha was at ease with Rio simply being there. They sat so that, every now and again, Agatha could reach to squeeze her hand - usually after she’d said something to tease Rio or when conversation lulled and she simply wanted to be touching her.</p>
<p>And Rio found that instead of trying to show off, as she usually might, she relaxed into it. She felt calm and less anxious than she had been for weeks.</p>
<p>Because regardless of what she’d said about compatibility before, she’d already decided nothing could sway her from wanting this. Wanting it forever. And she thought that perhaps Agatha felt the same.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Agatha said out of nowhere when they were both done with their food, soft but firm, “You wanted to talk.”</p>
<p>Rio pushed her plate away and watched as Agatha sipped her wine, her blue eyes alert as they looked everywhere but at Rio. She was nervous. Rio could see it in the way she played with the place mat, in the way she bounced her leg, in the way her sip turned into five more.</p>
<p>“Will we sit somewhere more comfortable?”</p>
<p>This question seemed to take Agatha by surprise. Perhaps she thought Rio would go for the jugular immediately. But <em>”Will you leave your husband for me?”</em> wouldn’t be the best place to start, and besides, Rio wasn’t like that.</p>
<p>She stood, picked up her wine and the bottle, and motioned with her head for Agatha to follow her.</p>
<p>The walk to the couch felt longer than it was. Thirteen steps, all in. Each one heavier than the last. The concept of Agatha struggling to open up to her had weighed heavily on Rio’s mind for weeks now. The idea of her being frightened or ashamed or simply unwilling, was almost too painful to comprehend.</p>
<p>But she’d offered to talk now. So Rio had to tread carefully.</p>
<p>Rio sat at the end of the couch and leant back against the arm, placing the bottle of wine on the coffee table. She watched as Agatha hesitated and then mirrored her position at the other end and Rio forced a warm smile, watching as Agatha toyed with the stem of her glass.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so nervous.” <em>I’m nervous too.</em></p>
<p>“I’m not.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded, focused on Agatha’s fingers. Agatha was a great actress, the best of them, but a terrible liar.</p>
<p>“Ooookay,” Rio raised her brows as Agatha’s eyes flashed up to meet her own. “Then why do you look so scared?”</p>
<p>Agatha cleared her throat and dropped her gaze again and Rio, despite her smile, could have cried.</p>
<p>She chewed on her lip as she focused in on the pale fingers that tapped a rhythm on the stem of her wine glass. She didn’t want to spook her. “Why the name Nicholas?”</p>
<p>The question just came to her, stolen from an errant thought she’d had when she’d first met Nicky. It was something she was curious to know, but it wasn’t what she wanted to ask.</p>
<p>Though the lowball question, the excuse to talk about her son seemed to loosen Agatha a little. Her fingers stopped twitching, her jaw relaxed. “It means ‘victory’, or ‘victory of the people’. He felt like my one success. I wanted him to grow up and know that from the moment I knew of him, he was my hero.”</p>
<p>Rio’s chest ached with a desire to reach out to Agatha again. But she only smiled, only bit down on the corner of her lip.</p>
<p>“And not ‘Bohner’?”</p>
<p>“No,” Agatha said softly, “I never took it and no son of mine would either.”</p>
<p>“Is Ralph a Harkness?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded and watched as Agatha’s fingers returned to their tapping. Nicky had relaxed her. Ralph had spooked her.</p>
<p>“Favourite ice cream flavour?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Rio inclined her head, “It shouldn’t be a hard question.”</p>
<p>“Pecan.”</p>
<p>A laugh escaped her and Agatha briefly looked scandalised. “What’s wrong with pecan?”</p>
<p>“It’s just… pecan. Mine’s chocolate.”</p>
<p>“Basic,” Agatha retorted, her lips twitching. Her fingers had stopped tapping. She was relaxing again.</p>
<p>“Okay, favourite colour?”</p>
<p>“Rio.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted to talk.”</p>
<p>“I’m talking. Getting to know you. <em>Relaxing</em> you.”</p>
<p>Agatha sighed and scratched at her scalp, turning her head away. “You don’t need to baby me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I just want you to relax. This doesn’t have to be stressful.”</p>
<p>Agatha closed her eyes and Rio’s lower lip pulled back between her teeth again. She waited until Agatha looked back at her and saw her gaze was warm, her blue eyes the colour of the sea.</p>
<p>“I can’t talk with you so far away.”</p>
<p>Rio raised her brows and tilted her head as Agatha adjusted herself. She moved from sitting with her legs crossed to her legs straight out before her, now parted to welcome Rio in. Rio smiled as Agatha held her free hand out and she shuffled on her knees towards her before she turned and sat back against her.</p>
<p>Agatha settled more around her and Rio swallowed down a swell of emotions when she realised this was the first time Agatha had held her like this. It was the first time she’d <em>asked</em> to hold her. She was only this needy when half asleep, when… but Rio realised suddenly she’d never really had the opportunity to be with Agatha for any length of time when she <em>could</em> be needy with her in a way that wasn’t between moans and stolen touches.</p>
<p>Maybe Agatha, in unstolen time, simply wanted her close.</p>
<p>Her heart ached at the prospect of a week with Agatha always wanting her nearby. Reaching for her, <em>asking</em> for her.</p>
<p>And as if Agatha could hear the hopeful promises of Rio’s internal monologue, Agatha’s arm was around her waist and she rested her wine against her hip, and Rio felt her press her nose into her hair and breathe her in. It felt extremely intimate. And Rio felt good about it, felt warm from the knowledge that Agatha was calming herself with her touch, taking her time to feel her against her, to luxuriate in the presence of her, to breathe her in.</p>
<p>“It’s purple,” Agatha said into her hair. “Violet, rather than lavender.”</p>
<p>“Like the lakers,” Rio said with a smile, remembering that first day in Agatha’s house.</p>
<p>“Mmhm.”</p>
<p>Rio entwined their fingers then, squeezing Agatha’s hand.</p>
<p>“What else do you want to know?”</p>
<p>“Tell me about your childhood.”</p>
<p>Agatha exhaled slowly and Rio couldn’t be sure but it felt like she was trying to buy time as she did. She was silent for a while and then she admitted: “It was unhappy. Hard.” Agatha tightened her hold on her and Rio turned her head to angle into Agatha, feeling her shift immediately and press in close to her ear. She lingered for a second and then pressed a soft kiss at the highest point of her cheekbone. “I don’t talk about it much. Don’t like to think about it.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded and Agatha pulled back so she turned her head away again, and was silent for a while, letting Agatha take her time with it.</p>
<p>And then Agatha began to talk about it.</p>
<p>“My father died not long after I was born.”</p>
<p>Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand.</p>
<p>“Probably a saving grace. He was apparently as cruel as my mother.”</p>
<p><em>Evanora</em>, Rio thought. She’d heard rumours of her, of course. Read articles. There had even been a long read in the New York Times about her a couple years ago: <em>Evanora’s Empire</em>. It had been an exploration of her decades at the top of every list of business heavyweights, the political power she wielded, the empire she’d built by being friendly with the most hard-line in society.</p>
<p>She already knew Agatha didn’t like to discuss her. She’d seen it in Italy - when the sun had been warm and Agatha’s reaction to her mother being mentioned had been cold.</p>
<p>Rio began to chew on her lip again, trying to weave together the complex web that was Agatha’s life.</p>
<p>“I was raised mostly by a woman named Isobel. She was from Mexico. She was a maid. I had nannies, of course. But Isobel… she was kind, and soft. She used to sneak me candy and every week she’d teach me ten more words. My mother didn’t want me to speak to the staff… but she wasn’t around a lot.”</p>
<p>“Ten words?” Rio asked softly, “In Spanish?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The impact on Rio’s soul was immediate. She felt instantly aflame with hatred for Evanora. The woman who’d birthed Agatha but had not nurtured, not loved her. And Agatha had defied her because every child reaches for softness when all they know is the opposite.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Isobel died when I was fifteen. She had a sudden heart attack and… I didn’t get to go to the funeral because-…”</p>
<p>But Rio had shifted, had pulled away so she could lean around and look at Agatha. Agatha blinked slowly and Rio frowned at her, “Baby.”</p>
<p>“It was a long time ago, Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio shifted more and winced at the twist of it as she slipped her hand by Agatha’s hip to hold herself up, settling a few inches down from Agatha’s face in the soft cushions of the couch. “I’m so sorry you lost her.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled a little and raised her hand to Rio’s cheek, brushing her thumb gently across her cheekbone. “It’s fine, Rio. Really. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Rio didn’t believe her. But she pulled away slowly and turned back to her previous position and let Agatha pull her back against her. Agatha was quiet again for a while but she’d buried her nose in Rio’s hair and Rio turned into the touch, letting Agatha have a moment to gather herself.</p>
<p>“Anyway… My mother was always there in the background, checking my grades and making sure I was friends with the right people. And I toed the line… I kept my head down.”</p>
<p>Agatha cleared her throat quietly and Rio looked down at their entwined fingers, drawing soft circles against Agatha’s pale skin with her thumb.</p>
<p>“I started performing in plays… Shakespeare, mostly, and my drama teacher gave me scripts and drove me to auditions when she realised I had something. But I could never book anything because my mother wouldn’t… anyway.”</p>
<p>Rio shook her head a little, staring blindly ahead.</p>
<p>“Then I went to college and got a boyfriend. I hadn’t kissed anyone yet. I hadn’t ever... wanted to. Not really, anyway. No one I ever thought I <em>could</em> kiss.”</p>
<p>Rio squeezed her hand and felt Agatha sigh into her hair. “His name was Luke and he was so gloriously dumb but he was gentle and so he was my first. But my mother didn’t approve. He wasn’t from the right family.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” Rio murmured under her breath, and Agatha kissed the back of her head.</p>
<p>“My mother had made the call to Ralph’s mother before I even met him. I was engaged before I…”</p>
<p>And Agatha stopped, squeezed Rio’s waist and lifted her wine up. When the glass returned to Rio’s hip it was empty. Rio frowned at it, her hold on Agatha’s other hand now vicelike.</p>
<p>“He was the best I could have hoped for at the time. He was bland, vanilla, nothing. Being tied to him was better than being tied to my mother.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be tied to anyone,” Rio said quietly, feeling as she did a heat rise in her cheeks, a fury fire in her belly. “That’s bullshit, Agatha.”</p>
<p>But it was hypocritical. A bare-faced lie. Because Rio wanted Agatha to be tied to <em>her</em>. In another, happier moment she might have imagined Agatha walking down the street with a little red string attached to her wrist, tugging a willing Rio along behind her, the same red string circling her own wrist.</p>
<p>Only Rio would never force it. She’d loop the string around every part of herself and hold it as an offering to Agatha, praying one day she’d take it but never demanding she did.</p>
<p>Agatha shifted behind her to place her empty glass down on the floor and Rio took the opportunity to move, to hasten to her knees and turn back to look at Agatha properly. She looked tense, her fingers now twisting in her lap, her right toying with her empty left ring finger.</p>
<p>“It’s what it is.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean it’s okay.”</p>
<p>Rio cautiously placed her hands on Agatha’s thighs, trying to relax her face as Agatha’s jaw flexed.</p>
<p>“I don’t need saved.”</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to save you. I’m telling you… I’m…”</p>
<p>And Agatha looked up then, her sea glass eyes cautious as they met Rio’s earnest brown. “I’m so fucking sorry you thought marrying him was the only option. I’m sorry… I’m sorry you feel trapped.”</p>
<p>Agatha dropped her gaze again and Rio moved her hands up to her hips, twisting her fingers into the soft fabric of her sweatpants, “Come here. Come back to me. Don’t pull away.”</p>
<p>Agatha didn’t respond for a while but with Rio’s encouragement she slowly shuffled closer, finally letting Rio tug her into her lap. Agatha’s hands were cool as they rested on Rio’s neck and Agatha’s nose was colder still as she pressed it into Rio’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Is that enough?”</p>
<p>Rio frowned and turned her head to look at Agatha properly, watching her as she raised her hand to Rio’s cheek. “Enough what?”</p>
<p>“Talking.”</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>Rio was quiet for a while, the volume of her ‘no’ getting louder and louder in her own brain until she eventually whispered, “Does she know you’re queer?”</p>
<p>Agatha looked away.</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>Rio felt the fury burn her again and she had to grit her teeth to prevent herself from saying something she couldn’t take back. Agatha’s thumb moved down to brush across her lips as her gaze dropped to them. “Why are you reacting this way?”</p>
<p>Rio’s brows knitted together and she pulled back a little, watching as Agatha’s eyes flashed with sudden panic. “What other way would I react?”</p>
<p>“Surely the fact that I’m married is-…”</p>
<p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p>
<p>Rio sighed heavily and closed her eyes, trying in earnest to keep her temper at bay. “I hate that you’re married, of course I do. But I fucking <em>hate</em> even more that you’re married to a man that not only you don’t <em>like</em> but in a marriage that you were forced into by your bigot fucking mother.”</p>
<p>Agatha was silent. Immobile on top of her. And after a while Rio opened her eyes to look at her. And she saw that Agatha looked astonished.</p>
<p>“Ag-..?”</p>
<p>Rio’s question was lost as Agatha pressed their lips together. Fierce and heavy. Rio made a quiet noise against her and then came to her senses and kissed her back.</p>
<p>The kiss was initially firm but chaste until Agatha made it anything but. She pressed into Rio and wrapped her legs around her as they devoured each other with lips and teeth and tongue.</p>
<p>Until Agatha was clawing at Rio’s scalp, her hips beginning to rock desperately against her abdomen, her mouth relentless in its devotion.</p>
<p>Agatha tasted like red wine and something Rio couldn’t describe but that she thought of privately as <em>heaven</em>.</p>
<p>But Agatha pulled away long before Rio wanted her too, breaking the kiss with a strength Rio would never have had. And they panted into each others mouths, Agatha’s hips stilling even as Rio gripped them and held her flush to her stomach.</p>
<p>“I don’t,” Agatha began, barely able to get the words out for her heavy breathing, “I don’t need saving.”</p>
<p>Rio nodded, knowing Agatha was too proud to ever admit that her kiss had meant to opposite. “I know. Baby, I know.”</p>
<p>Agatha leant in and kissed her again, and Rio frowned into it, feeling the sting of Agatha clutching at the roots of her hair until she relented and broke away.</p>
<p>Rio blinked her eyes open again and saw Agatha already looking at her, saw the green in her dilated eyes, saw the flush across her pale cheeks. She kissed Agatha’s pouting bottom lip and sucked gently on it, pulling away reluctantly to look back up again.</p>
<p>“You’re safe with me,” Rio murmured as Agatha inhaled audibly, her eye lids fluttering closed at Rio’s quiet promise. “You always will be.”</p>
<p>“You’re doing it again.”</p>
<p>“Doing what?”</p>
<p>“Being too sweet.”</p>
<p>Rio smiled and Agatha’s lips twitched. They looked at each other for a while, until Agatha’s soft expression became more serious and Rio felt her heart thrum harder against her ribcage.</p>
<p>“Is it always this easy?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Being with someone.”</p>
<p>Rio gasped quietly as Agatha brushed their lips together, barely a kiss, more an instinct.</p>
<p>“I think when it’s the right person it feels easy, yes.”</p>
<p>Agatha kissed her again then, slow this time, somehow sure. And Rio’s hold on her changed so she could rub Agatha’s back, brushing her hands slowly up and down, coming to a halt only when Agatha pulled away again.</p>
<p>“I’m tired,” Agatha said matter-of-factly, and it was clear on her face suddenly, the heaviness of her reality beyond the walls of their little sanctuary suddenly laid bare for Rio to see.</p>
<p>“We should go to bed.”</p>
<p><em>We.</em></p>
<p>This was the first night they could be that. Rio, a woman who so secretly feared she’d always be just a <em>me</em>, felt her heart stutter in her chest, feasting itself on the Agatha’s crumbs.</p>
<p>Rio released Agatha to let her climb from her. She took the hand that she held out to her. She walked silently with her, just one step behind, and arrived into the bedroom with her. Agatha let her go and disappeared into the bathroom and Rio found an old t-shirt she’d packed to wear and threw off her clothes to change into it.</p>
<p>As she waited for Agatha to return she heard her voice over and over in her brain repeating the things she’d clearly been telling herself after being raised like a pig to slaughter: <em> “he was bland, vanilla, nothing”</em>. But now this nothing man was the anchor holding Agatha down beneath the surface. Her mother was the unforgiving tide, churning without mercy, forcing her daughter deeper instead of teaching her how to swim.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>Rio startled and looked up. Agatha had appeared again, her hair up, her face shining from where she’d washed and cleansed. “You okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rio said quickly, too quickly, that Agatha caught on and frowned as Rio stepped towards her. “Just a lot to think about.”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded and bit her lip as Rio kissed her cheek and stepped around her.</p>
<p>“We’re okay though?”</p>
<p>Rio’s hand was on the bathroom door handle, halfway to opening it as she turned back to Agatha with a frown, “Agatha, nothing you could tell me would make us not okay.”</p>
<p>Agatha smiled but it didn’t reach her eyes and she turned away before Rio could see.</p>
<p>When Rio crawled into bed beside Agatha that night she didn’t comment on the t-shirt Agatha wore that she’d clearly stolen from her bag, she didn’t say anything as Agatha silently manoeuvred them to entangle together, and she said nothing when Agatha began to draw soft circles along the small of her back.</p>
<p>But Agatha spoke when Rio finally closed her eyes: “You didn’t ask about Nicky’s middle name.”</p>
<p>Rio frowned into the dark, fighting to compute. “What?”</p>
<p>“His middle name.”</p>
<p>“His…? What is it?”</p>
<p>“River.”</p>
<p>Rio’s frown changed then as she raised her brows and slowly opened her eyes. Agatha was already watching her, already trying to gage her reaction. “River?”</p>
<p>“I met a woman once who was wild and brilliant and I wanted him to…”</p>
<p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p>
<p>“I just thought you should know. Go to sleep, Rio.”</p>
<p>Rio stared across at the woman before her through the dim, the woman currently wearing yet another piece of her clothing she’d just stolen. The woman who was raised in cruelty but was so far from cruel. The woman who was so tightly curled around her, trying to get closer, trying to melt into Rio.</p>
<p>“My love,” Rio whispered reverently, half dumbfounded, half desperate, “his name is River?”</p>
<p>“His name,” Agatha said slowly, tugging Rio’s leg until it was draped over her hip, “isn’t as important as you sleeping.”</p>
<p>She leant in and nudged their noses together, Rio’s frown as deep as ever. “Did you name him after me?”</p>
<p>Agatha nodded soundlessly, and Rio continued to stare, watching as Agatha grew shy and turned her face into the pillow.</p>
<p>Their first night together Agatha had said a week wouldn’t even be enough, a sentiment they’d both acknowledged since, and that Rio felt more viscerally now than ever before. Because how could any limited amount of time with Agatha be enough? With the feel of her against her, the scent of her floral perfume filling her lungs, the hypnotic blue eyes she would gladly drown herself in.</p>
<p>The soft, surprising ways she found to tell Rio what she was so desperate to hear, even without saying the words: <em>“I love you too.”</em></p>
<p>And so, in the hopes that maybe she could make it clear where she stood in a night so fraught with confessions and thick with ghosts of Agatha’s past, she said: “I want you to know,” Rio murmured, moving her hand from Agatha’s back to rest on her cheek. “That if we made a go of this, a <em>real</em> one, then I’d be whatever you wanted me to be for Nicky.”</p>
<p>Agatha hadn’t raised her gaze yet and Rio wondered if it was because she’d already said too much, already revealed too much of herself. She gave her time. She let her sit in the silence for a while. And only when it became clear that Agatha wouldn’t, <em>couldn’t</em>, say anything, she pulled her hand back.</p>
<p>Agatha closed her eyes and Rio smiled sadly as she pressed closer, debating on rolling them over and pulling Agatha on top of her, wanting to feel the weight of her. Wanting to be the thing that supported her on this earth.</p>
<p>But she didn’t. She simply watched, counted the freckles on her nose.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>Agatha responded by rubbing her bare thigh. Rio let the motion soothe her, helping her brain to calm, her body to melt more into Agatha’s. As Rio drifted, Agatha slid her hand up to the bend at her hip and tapped gently, purposefully, four times.</p>

<h4>WEDNESDAY</h4><p>Rio woke with no thoughts in her empty head. But a lightly snoring woman in her arms.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was facing away from her, curled in on herself, her hair that had once been up in a neat bun, was now spread like wildfire behind her.</p><p>Rio was barely holding on. But she had her.</p><p>She lay still for a while, transitioning from sleeping to waking. The process was slow, a result of a long drive, a heavy night, and a bottle of red wine.</p><p>Sure Agatha was fast asleep still, she peeled away and slipped from the room.</p><p>When downstairs in the soft morning light she put on the coffee and tidied away the remnants of last night’s dinner.</p><p>Agatha was to be the chef for the week, so Rio could be the one who cleaned. She did so quickly, quietly, wanting Agatha to wake to a spotless kitchen and not have to witness Rio’s frustrated sighs when she couldn’t source the right locations for each thing she tidied away.</p><p>Agatha <em>deserved</em> a spotless kitchen. She deserved an easy life; a soft morning buried in the hills with someone who wanted to give that to her.</p><p>Rio debated going back to wake her. She considered bringing her a coffee or her best attempt at scrambled eggs. But it was still early. And bed was where Agatha could be warm and safe, away from the fears that plagued her.</p><p>So Rio took her own fears, alongside her mug of coffee and the large throw she’d stolen from the couch, and went to settle on one of the loungers on the balcony. It was cold, crisp. The morning air was relentless in its chill. And Rio tugged her knees close as she wrapped the blanket snuggly about her and cradled her coffee.</p><p>Over the hills she could see the famous bay, laid out like a painting. A Frisco fresco.</p><p>As she warmed herself, she thought of Agatha, snug in their bed. She thought of Agatha as she had been, back when she was in Evanora’s clutches. She thought of Agatha in Ralph’s large hands. She thought of Agatha wrapped in her own arms, where she hoped she always felt safe and loved.</p><p>She thought of Agatha as she was, as she is, as she would be.</p><p>And in thinking of her, she realised she loved her, not just the woman she knew, but every piece of her. Every past, present, future, her.</p><p>She took a sip of her coffee. She burnt her tongue.</p><p>She poked the tip of it to her top lip, feeling the cool air sting as it washed over it.</p><p>They were like two sides of the same coin, her and Agatha. Rio had been loved, endlessly, joyfully, unconditionally. And Agatha had been kept, molded, squashed, but certainly not <em>loved</em>.</p><p>And yet they both wanted it, and wanted it desperately.</p><p>Rio had found what she’d been looking for in Agatha. And she hoped Agatha had found what <em>she</em> had been looking for in Rio.</p><p>Because Rio would never keep, would never try to mold, would never squash Agatha. She would only love her the way she’d been taught. The way she’d dreamt about loving someone until those dreams had shifted into dreams of loving <em>Agatha</em> like that.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio jumped, almost spilling her hot coffee over herself. She turned to see Agatha standing hesitantly by the door.</p><p>“Morning, mi corazon.”</p><p>She smiled with the grace of a person who was looking at something beautiful, something only for them to see.</p><p>Agatha seemed to deliberate before she moved, before she closed the door behind her. But then she hurried, tip-toeing along the cool floor of the balcony, rushing to dive into the space Rio had opened for her between her legs, beneath the blanket.</p><p>Rio chuckled as Agatha grumbled in the chill, curling herself beneath the blanket that Rio threw back over them.</p><p>“Here.” She passed her the mug so Agatha could warm her hands and soon placed her now free mug-warmed hand over Agatha’s stomach as she kept the blankets closed firm around them with her other.</p><p>“There was coffee on the side, you know.”</p><p>“I have yours now.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but Agatha had leant back, had turned her head to kiss her cheek, and suddenly Rio had no problem sharing coffee.</p><p>“Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise from the base of her throat as she curled her legs up to get more beneath the blanket. Rio grinned, pressed her cold nose in behind Agatha’s ear and felt Agatha shiver as she muttered, “you know, I’m sure there are more blankets inside.”</p><p>“And deny you the chance to curl up with me? I wouldn’t do that to you.”</p><p>Rio huffed out a warm breath and Agatha hummed as Rio’s thumb moved slowly across her stomach.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, the scent of the fresh coffee, the fresh air, Agatha’s perfume, it was ambrosia, and she was Tantalus. But she’d take her eternal punishment in exchange for just this, just this morning with Agatha.</p><p>There was nothing but the soft sound of birdsong nearby, the breeze in the trees, Agatha’s breathing, the soft movements of fabric when she began to sip the hot coffee. And Rio didn’t want it to ever stop being like this, just the two of them, just the wind and Agatha.</p><p>After another couple of minutes Agatha turned a little and offered the coffee up. Rio took it and was grateful she’d drank only half, and that she’d done so quickly, so it was still warm when Rio drank the rest.</p><p>“You should know,” Agatha said after a few more minutes of silence in that cool morning air. And her voice was soft, but carried in it something Rio knew she wasn’t going to like. “If ever I were to leave Ralph, my mother would bankroll him. He’d have her on side.”</p><p>So she’d been thinking about it. Thinking about leaving Ralph and how hard it might be. And though Rio felt sick about it, about Agatha’s own flesh and blood siding against her, she also felt a selfish sort of relief that Agatha was beginning to edge towards the idea of leaving her husband.</p><p>She sighed heavily, ducked her head down to rest her chin on Agatha’s shoulder and they both sat in it for a minute; Agatha in her fear, Rio in her fury.</p><p>“If it were ever to come to that, however hard it gets,” Rio kept her voice soft, conscious that the world around them was silent and they were they only ones disturbing the peace. “I’d be with you every step of the way.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head and Rio lifted her own up cautiously, watching as blue eyes turned soft and Agatha whispered: “I wouldn’t ask you to be.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t need asking.”</p><p>Agatha nodded just once and turned back away, taking the opportunity now to steal back Rio’s mug of coffee which was now cold. Rio sighed quietly, a happy noise, a contented one as she ducked her head back down and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Silence wrapped around them again like the haar spreading its ghostlike fingers through the foothills beyond. Rio felt Agatha shiver against her and she tightened her hold on her, tugging the edges of the blanket they shared closer around them as Agatha pulled her legs up more towards herself.</p><p>“Why don’t you stay here and I’ll run you a bath?”</p><p>Agatha turned her head back into Rio again, curling her body around to lean against her more fully, her left shoulder now tucked below Rio’s right arm, her head against her shoulder.</p><p>“Just me?”</p><p>“I can join you if you’d like.”</p><p>“Stay here for a little.”</p><p>“It’s cold, baby.”</p><p>“Five minutes.”</p><p>Rio sighed, had no real fight in her about it, and simply brushed her hand up and down Agatha’s arm, knowing holding her like this was worth even frostbite.</p><p>Agatha began to toy with the fabric of her t-shirt, and it wasn’t long until she was lifting it, and making Rio gasp when her cold fingers found the warm skin of her side.</p><p>“You run hot.”</p><p>“And <em>you</em> are always cold.”</p><p>“Guess that means you need to warm me up.”</p><p>Rio laughed and pressed her face into Agatha’s hair, “<em>That</em> is that the bath was for.”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand move an inch or so up to her ribs.</p><p>“It’ll be a first.”</p><p>“A first what?”</p><p>“Shared bath.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and placed a kiss to Agatha’s head. “Then I’ll make it a good one. Plenty of bubbles. Hot coffee. Some candles. We’ll use the bath with the better view.”</p><p>“Have you had many… baths?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little but had long since decided the only way to get Agatha to ask her what she really wanted to was to play dumb. “I prefer to shower but-…”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Sí, mi amor?”</p><p>“Have you?”</p><p>“Have I what?”</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly and pushed up, breaking Rio’s wall of warm around them. But this was better. Agatha was straddling her, and Agatha wasn’t wearing any pants.</p><p>“Have you had many shared baths?”</p><p>“Well,” Rio began with a growing smirk, “it depends what you define as-…”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio trailed off, her hands picking up the slack as they moved up Agatha’s goose-bumped thighs. “I’ve had a few, yes. But none I was more excited about than this one.”</p><p>Agatha began to chew on her lip and Rio only noticed as she sat up properly, as her gaze finally made it up to her face, having been enjoying the journey from pale thighs to the sight of Agatha in her shirt.</p><p>“I’m frozen, Agatha. Can we go now?”</p><p>“Feel warm to me.”</p><p>Rio huffed a soft breath as her hands slipped below Agatha’s shirt. “Punishing me is also punishing you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled a little and leant down to nudge Rio’s chin up more with her index finger, “Okay. Run us a bath. But to make me forget that you’ve had <em>multiple</em> with other women, I want you naked for the rest of the day, okay?”</p><p>Rio was only too happy to agree. She nodded immediately, and soon was shouting her protests as Agatha began to pull away without so much as kissing her.</p><p>“Agatha! Agatha!” She laughed as she was denied, as Agatha stormed back inside, and as Rio was left, her lap empty, her fingers still tingling from the feel of Agatha’s warm skin.</p><p>When back inside, Rio practically ran to the first floor bathroom and sourced the spa-approved ingredients sure to transform the room into a tranquil, romantic space. She vaguely wondered where Agatha had gone but upon running from the bathroom to find candles to light (they’d be redundant in the morning light, but whatever), she heard her speaking to someone and realised it was Jen.</p><p>She heard Nicky’s name as she sped past and knew she was calling to make sure Jen had in the very least kept her son alive.</p><p>But Rio was on a mission, determined to make Agatha’s first shared bath experience perfect.</p><p>She filled the tub with the ingredients and set in motion the hot water until the room was steamy, the candles were lit, and the bubbles were multiplying.</p><p>She shot Agatha a quick grin as she whisked past and brought two steaming mugs of coffee with her as she put the finishing touches on her masterpiece by laying out two fluffy towels and two even fluffier robes.</p><p>Willing to be the guinea pig she stripped down and placed a delicate foot cautiously below the surface, hovering it there until she was certain the bath was hot, but not burn-your-skin-off hot. She slipped inside, careful not to dislodge any water. With her whole body now below the surface she could relax, knowing the final piece of the puzzle would soon be with her and Rio would officially be having the best bath in all the land.</p><p>Just as she lifted her arms out to take her mug of coffee from a little table she’d set up to the side, Agatha walked in and looked momentarily shocked by the changes she saw to the little bathroom.</p><p>“I wanted to make it special.”</p><p>“I did wonder why you were running around.”</p><p>Rio grinned, took a sip of coffee, noted the tip of her tongue was still a little tender, and placed it back down on the side. She held out her hand to Agatha, conscious but not caring she was now dripping water over the floor.</p><p>“Care to join, my love?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and Rio knew she was trying to hide her grin, but she didn’t have time to enjoy <em>that</em> because now Agatha was moving right up to the edge of the bath, was lifting her t-shirt slowly over her head, was standing in just her underwear, so close, so deliciously…</p><p>Rio had slipped.</p><p>She’d moved too quickly, too intent on touching Agatha, or pulling Agatha, or grabbing Agatha, anything to get her hands on her.</p><p>She yelled as she went backwards, her ass having lifted enough to slide down the porcelain bottom until she had a face full of bubbles and spluttered when she resurfaced.</p><p>“Fuck. Shit. Fuck.”</p><p>She wiped at her eyes and groaned as she heard Agatha laugh from beside the tub.</p><p>But Agatha’s dry hands replaced her own, and despite her loud laughter she was gentle about wiping her face, about helping Rio get the soapy water out of her eyes.</p><p>“That desperate, huh?”</p><p>“That <em>clumsy</em>,” Rio corrected with a scowl as Agatha beamed down at her. But apparently clumsy had its benefits. Agatha leant in to kiss her. A soft, appreciative kiss. One that didn’t quibble about silly things like the taste of soap on Rio’s lips.</p><p>She pulled back, stepped out of her underwear, and only then did her smile fade a little and Rio watched as Agatha did the silent math on where she was going to go in the bath.</p><p>“Wherever you’re comfortable,” Rio confirmed quietly as she pulled her knees in to give Agatha more space to manoeuvre. Agatha was chewing on her lip again but soon cleared her throat, stretched up to pile her hair on top of her head, and made Rio’s gaze drop significantly further south than would be polite.</p><p>Agatha stepped in then, and Rio remembered herself as she reached to hold her hand, making sure she wouldn’t slip as she turned her back to her and over her shoulder said with no hint of shyness, “Open your legs.”</p><p>Rio did. Only just managing not to slosh water everywhere. And was rewarded with the view of Agatha bending down, of the ability to raise her hand to her ass as she slowly sat before her and settled between Rio’s legs.</p><p>Agatha was quiet, but had already maintained a hold of Rio’s hand to tug it around her, toying with her fingers under the water.</p><p>“And what? You just… stew?”</p><p>Rio laughed, pressed her damp face into Agatha’s shoulder, kissed the freckled skin there. “Yes. You stew.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and Rio could just tell she was pursing her lips.</p><p>Through the window to the right of them, the early morning haar was dissipating and the sky was a pale grey over the undulating landscape. Agatha turned to it, slowly resting back properly against Rio. And Rio watched nature’s finest show too.</p><p>She’d long since been unable to decide which of Agatha’s features she loved the most. She had her favourites of course: her arms, her lips, her stomach, her thighs. But then there were the features she just couldn’t get used to. The ones she could now draw from memory, the ones she couldn’t describe if you paid her, but that she could feel against the pads of her fingers, on the tip of her tongue whenever she thought of them.</p><p>Her jaw, her nose.</p><p>Agatha’s profile was something to be studied, to be pondered over for millennia. It should be taught in schools as the Platonic ideal of beauty.</p><p>It should be tattooed on Rio’s body, the line of her perfect face, immortalised on the woman who had memorised it years before she’d even had the privilege of seeing it up close.</p><p>But she was staring. And Agatha was used to be stared at, so knew when she was. She turned to look at Rio and smiled softly, the bubbles and the quiet relaxing her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I just think you’re so beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows but Rio caught the soft blush that came over her cheeks and she smiled as Agatha turned from her to look straight ahead again and settle back some more.</p><p>“You’re so…”</p><p>“What? In love?”</p><p>“Is that what they call it?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, slipping her other arm beneath the surface to wrap around Agatha too. “Romantic baths are supposed to be romantic. I’m just telling you how I feel.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and Rio didn’t push it, deciding instead to lean around and press a kiss to Agatha’s temple, to breathe in her perfume that, though subtle, seemed to still overpower the excess of lavender bubble bath she’d sprinkled into the tub.</p><p>They relaxed back for a while, both occasionally drinking their coffee, both looking out the window, or closing their eyes. Both utterly, completely relaxed.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” Rio was the first to break the peace again, focusing on the soft ministrations of Agatha toying with her fingers.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Have you… ever thought about being with other women?”</p><p>Agatha stopped what she was doing with her fingers below the surface and turned her head slightly. She seemed to paused and then: “Yes.”</p><p>Rio nodded, careful not to let on that her stomach had just dropped. “Is that something… you’d want to explore?”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a while and had turned her head back forward again. She’d also started to play with Rio’s fingers once more, and Rio felt in every soft touch her heart begin to thud more immediately.</p><p>“Is that something you want?”</p><p>Rio frowned, watched the back of Agatha’s head as she dropped it slightly and wondered if she’d not made herself clear, if she’d <em>ever</em> been unclear about wanting only Agatha.</p><p>“I just want you, Agatha. That’s all I want.”</p><p>Agatha stopped playing with Rio’s fingers and Rio felt her stomach lurch with it, felt sick until her hand had been raised up and pressed to Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“I’m not interested in exploring anything with anyone else.”</p><p>As simple, as plainly spoken as that, Rio felt her heart begin to recover. She adjusted her hold on Agatha and pulled her closer, tugging her as she lay more down into the tub, bracing herself as best she could so she could hold them both above the waterline.</p><p>Agatha sighed out as she was adjusted but didn’t protest and soon her soft toying with Rio’s fingers changed as she instead ran her own fingers up and down Rio’s forearm. The motion of it was more soothing than the bubbles and the candles combined and Rio had to fight the sleep that threatened to pull her under.</p><p>“We’re pruning,” Agatha murmured once the heat had eased and the water became less than tepid. “If you blow out all the candles, I’ll make us brunch?”</p><p>“That doesn’t seem fair.”</p><p>Agatha began to pull away and Rio protested with a soft huff but soon she was standing and had turned to her and the visual itself was worth it alone.</p><p>“You can’t be naked whilst cooking. It’s not safe.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>Agatha was smirking and stepping out already, barely using Rio’s offered hand to help her.</p><p>When Rio stood to get out, Agatha pulled her onto the soft bathmat and opened the towel she’d already wrapped around herself to envelope Rio in it.</p><p>“But thank you,” she said quietly, already pressing her lips to Rio’s cheek. “I wouldn’t mind stewing with you again.”<br/>
Rio grinned, her eyes closed as she tightened her hold on Agatha enjoying the feel of their bodies pressed together before she released again as she pulled away.</p><p>“I’m serious about the naked thing, by the way.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rolled her eyes as she went to grab her own towel. “It’s freezing.”</p><p>“You can wear socks.”</p><p>“I am absolutely not walking around the house in just socks.”</p><p>Agatha left her with a laugh and twenty minutes later Rio was naked with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders, a fork in her hands, and thick socks on her feet.</p><p>“So humiliating,” she grumbled as she stabbed at the fluffiest scrambled eggs she’d ever seen in her life.</p><p>“I think it’s incredibly sexy.”</p><p>“Even with the socks?”</p><p>“Yes. It means I can look forward to undressing you even a little bit later.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and tugged her blanket closer around her, “Well I thought we should focus on you today.”</p><p>“On me?” Agatha paused with her own fork halfway up to her mouth.</p><p>“Yes. Build up your stamina.”</p><p>Agatha placed her for down and Rio smiled around hers as she took a large mouthful.</p><p>“You keep talking about my stamina like it’s-…”</p><p>“What?” Rio asked, still chewing on her toast, “Terrible?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and pushed her finished plate away. “Aren’t you a little cocky for someone who didn’t put up much of a fight about being naked all day?”</p><p>Rio smirked as she pushed her plate away too. “Yeah? Don’t you like me cocky? And naked?”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and moved to stand behind Rio. Her touch was featherlight as she swept the heavy blanket from Rio’s left shoulder and bent down to kiss her tanned skin. Rio smiled as she shivered, already moving her head to the side to grant more access as Agatha brushed her lips slowly along to her throat and placed a tender kiss to the small bruise she’d left there the previous day.</p><p>“Are you done with breakfast?”</p><p>“Definitely,” Rio breathed as Agatha smiled into her neck.</p><p>“Come.”</p><p>Rio turned and saw Agatha holding her hand out to her and she took it, allowed her to help her up, and held on as she followed Agatha through the house. Halfway up the stairs she dropped the blanket from where she held it around her neck and Agatha turned to see and smiled at the sight.</p><p>But they remained silent, and Rio only didn’t pounce on Agatha already because she wanted to see what she’d do, why she was being so stoic and quiet.</p><p>Agatha led Rio into their bedroom and she stopped by the edge of the bed, dragged Rio around in front of her and began hustling her up onto the mattress. Rio laughed as she was forced up. “Hey! Use your words!”</p><p>“Just go! Sit. Move!”</p><p>Rio laughed some more and huffed as she went to sit in the middle of the bed. “Happy?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio smiled as Agatha clambered onto the bed after her and pressed in against her chest to push her onto her back. “You know,” Rio began as Agatha ignored her and began to kiss along her sternum. “It’s usually polite to ask for people to lay down when you want them to. Rather than just manhandling them. Maybe they didn’t teach you manners in your fancy private school but…”</p><p>Agatha had made quick work of kissing down Rio’s body in this time and was now laying between her legs, her arms wrapped around her thighs, her brows raised, her eyes dark.</p><p>The sight alone shut Rio up.</p><p>And Agatha smiled because of it.</p><p>And then she did the thing she’d been thinking about doing since the car ride yesterday.</p><p>She ate Rio out until she was screaming her name and Agatha’s jaw ached.</p><p>But she crawled up Rio. She crawled up with a grin that said “I just gave you three orgasms in a row and you were <em>not</em> quiet about it.”</p><p>Rio was groaning and laughing, covering her face with her hands before Agatha had nudged them away and was determined to make her taste herself as she kissed her. Rio was more than happy to. More than happy to share in Agatha’s success as she kissed her back, and moaned some more.</p><p>“Your turn,” Rio eventually got out, when Agatha had relented in order to let them both breathe. But Agatha was already trying to crawl back down and Rio had to physically roll them over, with more than a little effort, to get her to stop.</p><p>But she did. When Rio’s lips wrapped around her nipple and she sucked hard enough to make Agatha cry out.</p><p>Agatha became compliant suddenly, arching up, already groaning as Rio reached down between them to finger her whilst she lavished her tits with the attention they so rightly deserved. And Agatha was responsive, Agatha came more quickly than even Rio was expecting, even when she knew all of her tells.</p><p>She pulled up, her breath ragged and broken, her lips swollen, her fingers stilled, her left hand still squeezing Agatha’s right breast. “That was-…”</p><p>“Shut up! Don’t say it! Don’t say it or-…!”</p><p>Rio laughed and kept her gaze up on Agatha as she ducked her head down, lapped at her pert, pink nipple. “Baby…”</p><p>“Shut. Up.”</p><p>“Mi amor…”</p><p>She sucked it gently.</p><p>“Rio, I swear to god if you mention one more time…”</p><p>Rio smirked as she nipped gently at the mound of Agatha’s breast. “Mami…”</p><p>Agatha gasped and Rio quirked a brow but didn’t look up as she enveloped Agatha’s breast into her hot mouth, swirling her tongue around it until her head was forced up with Agatha’s hand on her forehead.</p><p>“Sí?”</p><p>Agatha looked as if she were struggling for words so Rio gave them to her: “You like it?”</p><p>Agatha nodded just once. Rio smiled.</p><p>She pulled away, she moved quickly to begin tugging at Agatha, to make her move to sit in her lap as she leant back against the headboard.</p><p>Agatha was confused until Rio’s fingers were buried back inside of her and then she was just mute, just gasping, just clutching Rio’s head back to her chest. And Rio worshipped her there again, testing her theory that Agatha was enjoying it as much as she was and would come faster the more she played with her tits.</p><p>Her theory was proven correct.</p><p>Agatha was loud and whiny and desperate and Rio’s head was bent at such an angle that her neck was straining but she couldn’t bring herself to care when Agatha was losing it above her.</p><p>She made her come three times total in her lap, barely giving her time to recover after each orgasm, always marvelling at the little time it took for her to be built up again.</p><p>But she couldn’t breathe anymore, her nose was pink and her lips swollen from where she’d been buried against Agatha’s chest and she had to catch her breath, had to pull back and take a break. She smiled against Agatha’s flushed skin, laughed quietly when Agatha rocked her hips towards the hand that had pulled away from her to scratch instead at her stomach.</p><p>“Rio, either fuck me or-…”</p><p>Rio laughed against Agatha’s flushed chest, a deep, throaty chuckle.</p><p>“So greedy…. Or what, baby?”</p><p>“Or I’ll move away.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and let her lips press against Agatha’s breastbone, making sure she felt the vibrations.</p><p>“Ride my thigh.”</p><p>She kissed back over until she could wrap her lips around the nipple of Agatha’s right breast and hummed against it when Agatha said, with a firmness to her voice that hadn’t been there before: “I will not.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she pulled away and grinned up at Agatha.</p><p>“Tell me why.”</p><p>“I’m not a teenager.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“Or a bitch in heat.”</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio started in a softer voice than before, her warm hands moving slowly down equally warm sides until she was grasping Agatha’s hips and tugging her a little closer in her lap. “Cariño, I have just made you come <em>three times</em> in my lap.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“<em>And</em>,” Rio insisted slowly as she watched Agatha frown down at her, a captivating flush now across her cheeks and reddening every second, “I know how you like to be touched, what gets you off, what you like to be called, and I am telling you to <em>ride</em> my thigh.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and turned her face away but didn’t move from Rio’s lap. Which Rio took as a good sign, even as her dark gaze fell to the workings of Agatha’s tight jaw.</p><p>“Baby,” she said calmly, because she would happily spend a lifetime with Agatha on top of her like this, “I promise it’ll feel good.”</p><p>“I’m not doing it.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and kept her gaze up on Agatha’s face as she leant in to place a soft kiss between her breasts.</p><p>“You know,” she breathed out against the hot skin before her, “I’ve played basketball since I could walk. I run. I like to hike in my spare time…”</p><p>She pulled away slowly and saw that Agatha had turned back to her, frowning in confusion.</p><p>Rio smiled and squeezed her hips, “I do weight training and yoga on the weekends.”</p><p>“Your point?”</p><p>“My point, Agatha Harkness, is that I’m an athlete. I don’t only look good but I <em>feel</em> good.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned away again, but notably, didn’t move.</p><p>“So I know,” Rio leant back in to press another kiss to the mound of Agatha’s breast, letting her tongue flick out briefly to taste.</p><p>“I <em>know</em>,” she continued in a soft whisper against her skin, “that I can make you feel <em>so</em> good if you ride me. Por favor, mami.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a deep breath which made her chest rise and Rio’s head with it. She smiled, pressed another soft kiss to Agatha’s breast and then leant back a little to see the thoughts play out on Agatha’s face.</p><p>She hadn’t looked around yet, her jaw was still tight, but she also hadn’t moved, and more importantly, was still silent.</p><p>Rio took this as a silent assent and cautiously guided Agatha’s hips up and found she didn’t resist.</p><p>But she still wasn’t looking.</p><p>She shifted her legs beneath her and pulled Agatha to straddle her right thigh, squeezing her softly when she was confident she’d have the right angle.</p><p>Agatha was still looking away, still tense and the hands that had once had their long fingers tangled in Rio’s dark hair were now gripping it so tightly that Rio was slightly concerned Agatha’s intention was to rip it out.</p><p>But she gave enough slack to let Rio move in, closer.</p><p>She pressed her lips to the sensitive skin at the side of Agatha’s left breast and felt Agatha relax a little in her hold, heard a soft breath being released above her, and she knew she’d read her correctly.</p><p>Rio loosened her hold on Agatha’s hips to let her know she could take control, if she wanted it. She focused instead on worshipping Agatha again, on lavishing her breasts that for so many years would have no doubt been neglected by her ineffectual husband.</p><p>She kissed and sucked and teased with her tongue and soon could feel Agatha’s body beginning to move, her hips rolling with every purposeful brush of the flat of her tongue over Agatha’s nipple.</p><p>And Rio smiled as she did it, smiled as she held Agatha more firmly, helped to guide her into a rhythm that soon had her moaning above her, arching up against her mouth, and holding her head now so tightly that Rio thought she might suffocate against her chest.</p><p>A heroes way to die.</p><p>But if Rio thought she could be cool about what she was doing, she had never been more wrong in her life.</p><p>Agatha was becoming more desperate against her tensed thigh and Rio was urgently and hungrily sucking on her breast, her right hand releasing its hold on Agatha to reach for her other breast to squeeze and grasp at her so painfully tight she could have sworn she’d leave a mark in the shape of her hot hand against her.</p><p>But Agatha was rutting now, whining and panting heavily above her and Rio was losing control of how harsh she was being, how hard she was sucking, how loud she was in her desire.</p><p>Agatha painted her thigh and came with a scream and her nails pressing so harshly into Rio’s scalp that she whimpered a cry and released Agatha’s breast from her mouth, panting and whining as Agatha began to slow down above her.</p><p>Rio swallowed and fought hard to calm herself as she moved from fierce to gentle in seconds,  soothing Agatha’s red skin down with soft kisses and gentle caresses of her tongue and fingers.</p><p>And Agatha slowed to a stop above her and her fingers released her hair completely and brushed Rio’s hair until she was pushing her head back, nudging the sweaty strands from her forehead and staring down at her with a look of dazed exhaustion.</p><p>And Rio could only grin up at her. Could only beam at the beautiful mess she’d made of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>And Agatha began to smile too, moving her hand to clamp over Rio’s mouth to stop having to look at her goofy grin.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>Rio laughed against her hand and then groaned as Agatha pulled away and slid from her lap to lie down on the bed.</p><p>“Come back.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and covered her eyes with her arm as Rio crawled up her body and kissed over the places she’d been so needy earlier, smiling against the hot skin of her pink breasts.</p><p>“That was the hottest thing that’s ever happened to me.”</p><p>“Liar,” Agatha accused with a huff, unwilling to look at Rio still as the latter moved slowly up, barely moving her lips away from her skin as she did.</p><p>“I’m serious.”</p><p>“It felt-…”</p><p>“It felt what?”</p><p>Rio hovered above Agatha, waiting patiently for her to either say more or remove her arm from her eyes, or both.</p><p>She adjusted herself so she wasn’t touching her anymore and just as she was settling her right knee by Agatha’s right hip Agatha pulled her arm away and Rio saw her wide eyes.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Rio blinked and looked down between them, panicked she’d hurt her in some way.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Rio blinked again and looked up at Agatha who was staring at her with wide eyes still, watching her cautiously.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio asked slowly, still hovering above her, still not touching her.</p><p>“You pulled away.”</p><p>Rio frowned, tilted her head, studied Agatha for a second, “What?”</p><p>“You’re…” Agatha cleared her throat and pushed herself up on her elbows which made Rio naturally push up to give her space and Agatha almost winced at the movement and then began to scramble up the bed.</p><p>In her haste she knocked into Rio and Rio fumbled where she was on all fours and moved to rest back on her ankles.</p><p>“Mi vida, what are you doing?”</p><p>Agatha only scoffed, only kept her back to Rio as she moved about the room to grab her clothes, not noticing she’d picked up Rio’s t-shirt as she shoved it over her head.</p><p>“I knew it. Knew it.”</p><p>“Knew <em>what</em>, Agatha?”</p><p>Rio swallowed down her fear that Agatha had changed her mind again, that she was frantic because she wanted to be away from her. But her lips were still tender and swollen from the way she’d been worshipping Agatha’s body and her fingers were still damp and sticky from fucking her the best way she knew how and so she knew, even if Agatha walked out, she’d never be ashamed of how she’d been with her, how she’d tried, how she’d done everything she could.</p><p>But Agatha was spiralling and Rio knelt in the middle of the bed and watched it.</p><p>It wasn’t a kamikaze though, it was a spinning top.</p><p>And so Rio took a deep breath and then reached her hand out to Agatha which made her pause, turn, assess.</p><p>“Will you come here, please?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move but worked her jaw so much that Rio started to grin.</p><p>“Don’t laugh at me.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You pulled away.”</p><p>“I didn’t,” Rio reassured with her grin still in place.</p><p>Agatha turned her head and Rio shuffled on her knees towards her until she could reach for the fabric of her t-shirt and tug at the woman still not looking.</p><p>“I just told you that was the hottest thing that’s ever happened to me.”</p><p>“You pulled back.”</p><p>But Agatha had moved closer and Rio continued to smile at her, her hold changing from her t-shirt to her waist and she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s jaw. “I was looking at you. Giving you space to breathe.”</p><p>Agatha’s body began to relax a little in Rio’s hold and she turned her head to nudge at her nose. “You pulled away.”</p><p>Rio could only grin, could only slide her hands down Agatha’s torso to brush her fingers over her stomach, lowering her voice to a sultry murmur, “Nunca, mi amor.” <em>Never, my love.</em></p><p>Agatha huffed quietly, her eyes fluttering closed as she leant into Rio, and Rio took the opportunity to slide her hands down to Agatha’s ass, squeezing it before she began to tug her onto the bed.</p><p>They fell backwards; Rio fell first, but Agatha fell harder.</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha muttered quietly, catching herself at the last second so she didn’t squash Rio.</p><p>“You thought I’d let you get off against my thigh and then be done with you?”</p><p>“I thought,” Agatha began and the groaned and collapsed completely into Rio, hiding her face against the mattress beside her head, “I just thought you were making fun of me.”</p><p>Rio’s hold around Agatha’s waist tightened and she shook her head, “Why would I make fun of the goddess who just came so beautifully on top of me?”</p><p>“God, shut up.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly, turning her head to bury her face into Agatha’s hair, “Did I fuck your brains out, sweetheart?”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a hot breath against Rio’s ear and made her squirm. “Shut up.”</p><p>“Five orgasms <em>is</em> a lot. And for someone who isn’t used to coming during sex it must be-…”</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>But Rio was laughing and so wasn’t able to stop Agatha wrestle her until she had her wrists pinned up above her head and Agatha was leaning over her with a scowl.</p><p>“You’re enjoying this too much.”</p><p>“Making Agatha Harkness come so many times she actually loses it is impressive, you have to admit.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and tightened her hold on Rio’s wrists, her hair now falling in curtains around the two of them.</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip and nodded a little, still smug. “Don’t you want your girl cocky that she can make you come so much, mi amor?”</p><p>All fight seemed to disappear from Agatha’s face then and she rolled her eyes, released Rio’s wrists, and began to crawl down her body until she unceremoniously flopped on top of her. Rio laughed after the initial grunt and then sighed happily as she began to stroke through Agatha’s knotted hair.</p><p>“How’re you feeling?”</p><p>Rio had let them lay in silence for a while, letting Agatha calm herself, letting her toy with the ends of her hair.</p><p>“Warm,” Agatha said quietly, mumbling it against Rio’s clavicle, “Sticky. Tender.”</p><p>Rio nodded and thought for a second, “Happy?”</p><p>“Unbelievably so.”</p><p>The words were softer than the previous ones and Rio could only guess why. She assumed Agatha was feeling some of what she was. That this level of happiness was unheard of. Was manufactured by writers rooms and studios.</p><p>But it was real, it was now, it was theirs.</p><p>That afternoon they showered together, they changed into warm clothes, they sprawled out in the chilly air on the balcony. And Rio laid in Agatha’s lap as she FaceTimed Nicky when he was back from school - careful only to show her own face and the view.</p><p>Rio smiled as the mother and son talked about his day, about how Jen let him have chocolate ice cream for dinner, and how she wouldn’t play basketball with him.</p><p>And the world became quiet again after Agatha hung up from her son and called Jen to chastise her for her meal plan choices - though Rio had been on Jen’s side for this one.</p><p>They made dinner, or Agatha did. Rio poured the wine. They watched a movie. They curled up together and kissed whenever they felt like it had been too long since their last one.</p><p>They lived easily, gently, blissfully.</p><h4>Thursday</h4><p>It was strange how quickly and easy things became domestic. How Agatha would anticipate when Rio needed a top up of wine or water or coffee. How Rio would situate herself on the couch for Agatha’s comfort first and foremost. How every time one of them left a room they’d pay the price in the form of a kiss to the other.</p><p>On this day in particular day, the third one spent together, a lazy Thursday where they’d spent the morning lounging and kissing lazily in the bed, on the couch, against the counter, on the balcony, Rio was watching the Celtics game. She had a beer in one hand resting on the back of the couch, Agatha’s head against her thigh, her other hand casually running through Agatha’s hair. Agatha was reading a book, holding it above her face. She was relaxed, unbothered by Rio’s request to watch her game, so long as she could be close still.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered after a particularly bad setup. “Can’t pass for shit.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a smile but she said nothing as she continued to read, turning the pages. Apparently Stanislavsky’s <em>An Actor Prepares</em> was more interesting than the Celtics vs Bulls game.</p><p>Rio vehemently disagreed.</p><p>It went on like this for a while, Agatha at peace with her book and Rio feeling anything but peace even as she continued to gently stroke through Agatha’s hair, a new habit she’d formed in the two days they’d spent together so far.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha announced after twenty or so more minutes of reading but really listening to Rio mutter to herself or shout at the tv. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Agatha sat up quickly, placing her book on the coffee table, and delivered the requisite offering required before leaving a room.</p><p>Rio frowned into the kiss but received no further explanation for Agatha’s sudden departure and turned back to the game when Agatha turned to leave.</p><p>Just as a particularly bad throw in happened on the screen a flash of green caught her eye in her peripheral vision and she turned to see something that made her forget all about basketball and the insults she was about to throw.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“I figured your team wasn’t doing very well. So maybe you could use the extra support.”</p><p>Agatha was standing at the edge of the couch wearing nothing but her Celtics jersey with the number ‘4’ emblazoned across it. Her hair was messy from where Rio had had her way with it and she was smirking as if she knew exactly what this would do to the woman now staring at her from the couch.</p><p>She moved closer and Rio remained silent.</p><p>“You don’t like it?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“It’s okay I can go change.”</p><p>“N-no!” Rio cursed herself as she scrambled for Agatha’s hand and saw the smirk creep up Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Oh? You <em>do</em> like it.”</p><p>Rio swallowed as Agatha straddled her. She could hear the commentary of the game but suddenly didn’t care at all about what was going on.</p><p>Her gaze fell to pale thighs either side of her and she was quick to shove the beer between the cushions beside them so she had an extra hand to touch what Agatha was so readily offering.</p><p>Tutting as Rio’s hands began to rub along her thighs, Agatha grabbed the beer and leant back, making Rio change her hold to support her back and giving her a glorious view of the black underwear Agatha wore beneath her jersey as well as the stiff nipples that strained against the fabric as she leant away.</p><p>“It’ll spill,” Agatha chastised as she pulled back up and grinned at Rio. “But if I stay here you’ll miss the game.”</p><p>“Whatever,” Rio frowned, her hands roaming down again to Agatha’s hips to pull her closer. “Don’t care. Stay forever.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk turned into a grin and she shifted her hips forwards with the help of Rio’s grabbing hands. “I had other plans, actually.”</p><p>Rio whimpered involuntarily as Agatha closed the distance between them and kissed her. It was immediately hungry, immediately fierce, as if they hadn’t spent the whole of the morning kissing every opportunity they got.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t linger. She instead pushed Rio back, her hand splayed against her chest, and Rio had no choice as Agatha began to journey down her body, slipping back onto the floor. Somebody scored and the crowd cheered but Rio’s attention was fully on Agatha as she was parting her thighs and already working to remove her sweats.</p><p>“Watch the match, baby.”</p><p>“Game,” Rio managed to correct as she lifted her hips to help out. Agatha wasn’t in a rush and Rio wasn’t capable of focusing back on the television when she had <em>this</em> vision before her.</p><p>Agatha had removed her underwear now, was kissing along the inside of her thigh, and Rio shifted her hips forwards a little, relaxing back as she moved the hair falling in Agatha’s face to get a better look at her.</p><p>“Ver el partido,” <em>watch the game</em> Agatha murmured, shooting a wry smile up at Rio, “o me detendré.” <em>Or I’ll stop.</em></p><p>Rio made a soft noise of protest but Agatha was grinning against her now, kissing further up her thighs and Rio closed her eyes just as she felt her warm breath exactly where she wanted it.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha rolled her name on her tongue, exaggerating it, showing off what her talented tongue could do. “El partido, mi quierda.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open and she looked straight ahead, not trusting herself that she’d be able to look away if she looked down at Agatha. But she struggled to focus. Not when soft lips met her with deliberate gentleness, as if savouring the moment before the taste of her even hit Agatha’s tongue.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth shaped around her, and it took every ounce of self control for Rio not to watch, not to meet the dark gaze of the woman between her thighs. For a heartbeat, Agatha was still, and Rio knew she was waiting to see if Rio would defy her.</p><p>But she was satisfied as Rio kept her gaze on what was now a blur of greens and reds running about a court.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise as she dragged her tongue slowly through her and Rio whimpered as she looked down, her fingers now buried unconsciously in Agatha’s hair at the sides of her head.</p><p>Agatha tutted quietly, squeezed Rio’s thighs and raised them over her shoulders to trap herself between them. “Concéntrate, cariño.”</p><p>Rio frowned and bit down on her lip, flexing her fingers briefly in dark hair before she looked back up again and her mouth fell open as Agatha pressed her tongue back against her. She was taking her time with it, showing off the technique she’d practised and honed, proving she’d mapped the route many times over and knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>And Rio fell out of her brain, watching as her team slowly crept their way to victory, as Agatha kept her teetering on the edge for minutes. Too many minutes.</p><p>The countdown timer in the corner of the screen didn’t help.</p><p>But every time she looked down, Agatha was looking at her her. Sharklike in her watchfulness but unbelievably gentle below the surface.</p><p>She stopped whenever Rio looked her way and Rio always groaned, always had to look back up to get her to do anything again.</p><p>After what felt like an age she risked it once more and saw that Agatha’s eyes were finally closed, she was dipping her mouth down, rimming her entrance with the tip of her tongue and nudging her clit with her nose. Rio tried not to press her thighs together, tried not to trap Agatha there forever. But after minutes of teasing, after being edged so gently, as Agatha pushed her tongue inside her and Rio’s hips began to shift desperately, moving only to rub more against the nose she loved so dearly, she came with a broken moan.</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise against her as Rio’s thighs quaked and she constricted. And when Rio relaxed and shook slightly from the effort, Agatha pulled slowly away and placed glistening kisses to her thighs.</p><p>“You taste so fucking good.”</p><p>Rio bit down on the inside of her cheek as Agatha playfully bit just beside her knee. “When an actor is so completely absorbed by a profoundly moving object so that he throws his whole being passionately into its execution, he reaches a state we call inspiration.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows as Agatha began to crawl up her again, taking advantage of Rio’s hips having shifted forwards so she could wrap her legs around her waist as she kissed her.</p><p>“Is that…” Rio asked as Agatha pulled back and she licked the taste of herself off her own lips, “Stanislavsky?”</p><p>“Mmhm. I find going down on you inspiring.”</p><p>“Is that supposed to be a compliment?”</p><p>Agatha’s grin softened and she wiped over her lips with her thumb and then sucked on it as she thought on her response: “The aim in his technique is naturalism. Being wholly there. Wholly present. And I find… I feel most natural, most myself, when I can taste you on my tongue.”</p><p>The hands that Rio had placed back on Agatha’s thighs seemed to glitch at Agatha’s words, they twitched and grabbed at the fabric of Agatha’s thin jersey and Rio simply stared.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Agatha’s whole face that softened, her demeanour changing on a dime. She brushed the hair away from Rio’s cheeks and with the soundtrack of cheers and commentary behind them, she leant in to kiss Rio again.</p><p>It was warm, tender, <em>natural</em>.</p><p>Rio sucked in audibly when Agatha pulled back and watched the tenderness sink down to shyness before Agatha was sliding from her and Rio tried to grab her to make her stay, but she’d reacted too slowly. Agatha smiled as she kissed her again and cupped her cheek, “Watch your game. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio remained silent as Agatha returned to her previous position with her book above her and her head in Rio’s lap and Rio naturally began to toy with her hair again, though with her free hand she now tenderly stroked her knuckle along Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>The game continued but Rio was stuck staring at Agatha. And Agatha must have known but she didn’t comment, didn’t look back at Rio, and focused instead on her book.</p><p>Miguel Vidal had once said of his daughter that the first woman to get between her and her precious Celtics would be the woman for her. And Rio had laughed in his face.</p><p>No woman was better than the team she’d supported since she was old enough to have a concept of favourites.</p><p>But as she stared down at Agatha, as she focused on the faint furrow of her brow, the deep, attentive blue of her eyes as she continued to read, the now ever-present sight of her freckles on her makeup-free face, she knew she only had one favourite and nothing could get between <em>them</em>.</p><p>“Baby,” she whispered as someone scored. Agatha raised her brows and marked her place on the page with her finger before she looked round to Rio. “I love you.”</p><p>Surprise flickered across Agatha’s face before she smiled and turned her head to the hand hovering near her cheek to kiss over Rio’s knuckle.</p><p>As she turned back to her Stanislavsky, Rio turned back to her Celtics and saw, with some surprise, that her team were now kicking the Bulls’ asses.</p><p>The countdown timer ticked on.</p><p>Rio focused in.</p><p>Agatha continued to read.</p><p>Celtics beat the Bulls 144 vs. 39.</p><p>The rest of their day Rio was on a high from her team’s success and Agatha rode it with her. They celebrated as best they knew how: with their tongues and teeth and desperate hands.</p><p>The score at the end of their long day was Agatha 7, Rio 6.</p><p>Agatha had tried to insist that Rio let her make it even but Rio was now too hungry to give in and instead told Agatha a warm meal of her choosing would be worth ten orgasms on its own. Agatha did <em>not</em> agree with this logic but she gave in when Rio made cooking a little more pleasurable by remaining wrapped around her for the majority of the time.</p><p>They ate late in the night beside each other on the couch. And Rio finished first, her hunger taking over her desire to eat the stir fry delicately. Soon she was sprawled out and Agatha had piled their plates up, already making moves to join her.</p><p>The Celtics game had been replaced by an old episode of Seinfeld and Rio watched without really seeing, curled as she was now behind Agatha, too content to even try to focus.</p><p>Agatha held her hand against her stomach and for a while they remained that way, until the credits rolled and Rio shuffled down to press into Agatha’s neck, her body satisfied from the day’s activities and her full stomach.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha whispered as she flicked the remote to turn off the screen. “Are you falling asleep?”</p><p>Rio grunted and Agatha laughed as she moved off the couch, letting Rio take advantage of the space by turning on her back and tugging the throw down with her.</p><p>Rio gasped loudly as Agatha’s hand pressed half her body weight into her stomach.</p><p>“Careful, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha shifted and muttered a soft apology, curling her fingers around Rio’s collar as she settled in.</p><p>Rio relaxed back down and gathered Agatha in, pressing her close. They were both silent for a while and Rio closed her eyes. Sleep was already entering her conscious brain, tugging her towards its soft embrace when Agatha spoke again.</p><p>“Your dad doesn’t use your mom’s name.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Miguel doesn’t ever refer to Anna by name.”</p><p>“What? Oh. No.”</p><p>“Mi amor, mi vida,” Agatha recited.</p><p>“Mi <em>alma</em>.” Rio added with a soft smile, feeling Agatha reach up to brush her nose against her throat. “Mi corazon.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little more as Agatha tugged her shirt down an inch to kiss her skin. And they laid like that for a while before Agatha spoke once more.</p><p>“They’ve been married thirty six years?”</p><p>“Mm. Thirty seven in the summer.” Rio yawned softly, absently running her fingers along Agatha’s side.</p><p>She felt Agatha nod against her. “Quite the achievement.”</p><p>Rio hummed in agreement, her eyes still closed, her body warm and comfortable beneath Agatha’s. There had been a question in Agatha’s statements somewhere. A veiled request. And Rio fought her tired mind to find it, to work backwards as if it were a riddle rather than an observation.</p><p>Agatha had brought up her parents. Their marriage. Her dad’s inability to call her mom anything other than words that told the world, and her, everything in his heart.</p><p>And so Rio worked it out. Even in her sleep-addled mind she knew what Agatha wanted but would never ask. She would make pains to call her “my love”, “my soul”, “my heart”, “my life”, because, at least for now, she couldn’t call her “mine”.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Are you falling asleep?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha turned her face up and laughed. The warm breath against her neck made Rio shiver and she grinned blindly as she felt the bridge of Agatha’s nose against her jaw.</p><p>“Wake up.”</p><p>“Mm’awake.”</p><p>“Open your eyes.”</p><p>Rio huffed and peeked one eye open to squint at Agatha and saw that she was hovering over her now and grinning. It made Rio feel warmer than she had been before.</p><p>“I’m too old to fall asleep on the couch.”</p><p>Rio laughed and closed her eyes again, “Isn’t falling asleep on the couch <em>for</em> old people.”</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise from the base of her throat and Rio felt her kiss her cheek and then scramble over her.</p><p>“Hey! Where are you going?”</p><p>“Stay there.”</p><p>Rio scowled and threw herself back where she’d sat up to try and grab at Agatha. She stretched her arms above her head and groaned as she stretched, staring up at the ceiling as she waited.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t make her wait long. She was marching back in, looking smug and carrying a pillow from the bed and an extra blanket.</p><p>Rio turned to her and sat up more as she approached, looking from the blanket in her hand to the smile on her face.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The small smile grew into a much larger one as Agatha made to straddle Rio’s lap, the pillow landing on her left and the blanket now to their right. “If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it properly. And so <em>you</em> don’t wake up with a bad neck in the morning.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows in surprise, her hands already slipping up to hold Agatha at her ribs. “You’re worried for my neck?”</p><p>“If you’re injured that very much limits what we can do together tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, her thumbs brushing small circles over Agatha’s warm skin. “No. You brought a pillow because you care that I’m comfortable.”</p><p>“Yes, whatever. I also care that I’m warm. Hence the blanket.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and dropped her hands down, watching the way Agatha’s back stretched when she skimmed across the sensitive skin of her waist. “Will you be warm enough?”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said, her grin returning as she leant in and kissed Rio on the nose, “I have you for that.”</p><p>“Glad to be of service.”</p><p>Agatha ducked down and kissed her properly then and Rio wrapped her arms around her to keep her close. “We don’t have to.”</p><p>“You think I don’t want an excuse to lie on top of you by the fire all night?”</p><p>And Rio couldn’t think of anything she’d like <em>more</em> than to have Agatha to lie on top of her by the fire all night.</p><p>But Agatha was kissing her again so she couldn’t tell her. Instead she held her closer, opening her mouth readily to brush her tongue with Agatha’s. She moaned into it, felt the kiss change as Agatha slowed it down.</p><p>It wasn’t as desperate as their kisses had been earlier in the day. It was slower, and Rio felt every touch of Agatha’s tongue and caress of her lips as if she were all she’d been placed on this earth to do.</p><p>They broke apart, both panting softly, both smiling through it. “I’m going to get off you now,” Agatha whispered, kissing Rio’s lips softly. “And you’re going to get comfortable, and then I’m going to get back on top of you, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, squeezing Agatha’s hips as they kissed again. It lingered this time until Agatha was pulling away and standing from Rio. Rio only moved because the faster she did the sooner Agatha would be back.</p><p>She found that when she pressed her head against the pillow she groaned as she stretched out and Agatha moved so she was able to. “You’re cute when you’re sleepy.”</p><p>“I’m always cute.”</p><p>“Cut<em>er</em>, then.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rubbed at her eyes, “Stop admiring and come here.”</p><p>“Admiring,” Agatha scoffed as she repositioned herself against Rio again, and snuck her hand up her shirt as she did.</p><p>“No groping.”</p><p>Blatantly ignoring this, Agatha pushed her hand further up until she had hold of Rio’s breast and Rio only huffed a little, “Can’t sleep with you doing that.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Agatha moved her hand back down and Rio missed it immediately.</p><p>“Go to sleep.”</p><p>By the light of the fire and the soft breath of Agatha against her, Rio accepted the pull to unconsciousness.</p><p>Rio woke slowly, the kind of wakening where you’re still really asleep, still unsure of where your limbs are and what the concept of dawn even is. She moved a little, aware of the weight of Agatha lying half across her, of her soft breathing, of her warm breath.</p><p>Her hand moved to grasp Agatha’s against her chest and it felt cool, or cooler than she expected. Agatha shifted and mumbled and pressed closer and Rio smiled as she began to wake more.</p><p>“Baby? Mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha grumbled this time and Rio smiled as she began to try and shuffle from her. “You’re cold.”</p><p>“Mm’sleeping.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond and threw a leg off the couch to plant herself so she could probably disentangle. Agatha grumbled again and by the time Rio was free from her clutches - though it had taken a little convincing to get her to stop grasping her collar - she began to tug her up too.</p><p>“C’mere. Come to bed.”</p><p>“Y’wanted to sleep on the couch.”</p><p>“Yes but you’re cold. Come to bed.”</p><p>It turned out that Agatha was more pliant in her sleep. She grumbled some but let Rio take her hand and drag her through to the bedroom.</p><p>By the time they were back under sheets - heavier than the blankets they’d had on the couch - Agatha had stopped her small noises of protest in favour of pressing as close as she could to Rio. And Rio was diligent about ensuring she was wrapped as tightly around Agatha as possible.</p><p>She’d tugged the duvet closer, was rubbing her warm hand up and down Agatha’s warm back, was closing her eyes and settling back into the warm clutch of sleep when two words were breathed out against her throat, lost to the conscious world: “Thank you, my love.”</p><h4>Friday</h4><p>Rio had made the right decision to move them both to the bed again.</p><p>The bed where it was soft and warm, and the thought of leaving it was inconceivable. Especially when Agatha was curled close, not in her arms, but within reach.</p><p>“You’re awake.”</p><p>Rio groaned in response, curling up more, frowning as she waited for the inevitable call to get up.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio huffed, but otherwise didn’t respond.</p><p>“I put a coffee for you on the side.”</p><p>So Agatha had been up already? Agatha had been up and returned to the bed and not squeezed herself into Rio’s arms? That seemed unreasonable.</p><p>“And I want you to drink it, then shower, then grab a banana or something because I want to use whatever you brought with you.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Oh?</p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p>Rio opened her eyes and saw that Agatha was indeed close but that she was on top of the duvet, her lower lip sucked between her teeth, her eyes a little wider than usual, her cheeks flushed.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio choked out, forcing herself to sit up.</p><p>“Can I… see them first?”</p><p>Rio nodded stupidly, for some reason expecting Agatha to suddenly laugh and say she was joking and would <em>never</em> want to do anything with Rio’s paltry selection of toys.</p><p>Not that she’d mind if she didn’t.</p><p>It was being laughed at that was the concern.</p><p>But she was moving already. She was scrambling from the bed and practically falling over herself in her haste to get out to her car, to pop the trunk, to grab the backpack that had the words ‘Atlanta Crew’ emblazoned on the back.</p><p>She made it just in time. Before her legs gave way, that was.</p><p>She rushed back, blushing a deep crimson as she flew up the stairs and back into the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha was now cradling her own mug of coffee in her lap, sitting demurely on the edge of the bed and Rio hesitated as she caught her breath.</p><p>“Excited much?”</p><p>“Shut up,” she insisted as she disappeared to grab a towel from the bathroom and laid it on the floor before Agatha’s feet. She then, feeling her blush spread high up her cheeks, began to unpack one by one, placing each thing on the towel gently, as if they would break.</p><p>When she was done she stood back and watched Agatha expectantly, wondering what she was thinking. Hoping she might make a quick choice and they could get right to it.</p><p>From left to right Rio had brought: the pink vibrator she’d used on herself on FaceTime with Agatha, a light blue strap around five-inches and slightly curved, a larger darker blue one with realistic veins and mushroom tip, a strapless dildo, a harness, a half-filled bottle of lube, a bullet vibrator, and right at the very end, pink fluffy handcuffs.</p><p>“They were a joke gift from Alice. I have better ones but…” Rio tried to explain, already embarrassed that she’d even bothered to bring them.</p><p>But Agatha’s eyes were somewhere else, on the least exciting item on the towel. The lube.</p><p>“You’ve used these before?”</p><p>“Yeah, they’re fully clean though don’t-…” Rio had raised her gaze up and met Agatha’s eyes and saw in them her mistake. Her pale jaw was flexing to the beat of Rio’s rapidly increasing heart rate and blue eyes that had once been soft and shy now looked murderous.</p><p>“You brought dildos that have been inside other women?”</p><p>Rio had been wrong earlier.</p><p>She’d rather Agatha laughed at her.</p><p>This was <em>much</em> worse.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“God, Rio.” Agatha stood suddenly, already storming from the room. “You think I’d let you anywhere near me when they’ve been-…?! Fuck. Get rid of them.”</p><p>Rio had followed Agatha out but Agatha had stopped abruptly and was rounding on her now, making Rio stumble. “<em>Now.</em> Get them in the trash!”</p><p>“<em>Mi amor</em>,” Rio tired, deeply contrite, deeply embarrassed, “I didn’t have time. I just had to grab what I had and-…”</p><p>“And you thought I’d be okay with it?!”</p><p>“Baby, please. I didn’t think. Let me…” she made it to Agatha without Agatha pulling away and held tightly to her arm, “Let me go and buy some more. Tell me what you want and I’ll get it.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw was still tight, and she wouldn’t look at Rio but Rio was stepping more into her, and soon was pressing her face into her cheek, smiling a little when she felt Agatha’s arms drop and her fingers touch the fabric of her shirt.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she curled her tongue around the word, and Agatha turned more into her, “tell me what you want and I’ll get it for you.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly and ever so slowly, as if she were fighting herself to do it, she wrapped her arms around Rio. Rio exhaled in relief and kissed her way to Agatha’s lips. “I’m sorry. I really didn’t have time to get anything new.”</p><p>Agatha nodded but didn’t say anything and Rio moved to trace her lips along her tense jawline. “I’ll trash them. Buy new ones. Ones just for us, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded again and Rio pulled back and saw the hesitance in Agatha’s gaze, the embarrassment in her pink cheeks.</p><p>“What would you like? Have you thought about it?”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze away and Rio smiled as she held her cheek, “It’s okay. It’s just me.”</p><p>Agatha was silent though, lost to whatever was swirling in her complicated brain.</p><p>“Do you use a vibrator?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and seemed to decide this level of embarrassment was beneath her as she shook her hair out behind her and boldly claimed: “Of course.”</p><p>“Okay… tell me what kind. A bullet? A rabbit? A-…?”</p><p>“A bullet. Small. Hidden away.”</p><p>Rio nodded and smiled a little, “Hidden from Ralph?”</p><p>“No. We have separate rooms, just…”</p><p>This was news to Rio. This was <em>big</em> news. Agatha, the woman who wouldn’t sleep unless she had at least two limbs touching Rio at all times slept alone.</p><p>“You sleep apart?”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>“Well, no, actually,” Rio frowned at this declaration. “How is that obvious?”</p><p>Agatha bit the corner of her lip and as Rio tried to pull away a little she tightened her hold. “I assumed you knew.”</p><p>“I wish I’d been told.”</p><p>Agatha turned from her, dropped her gaze and Rio closed her eyes so she didn’t have to see her building her walls again. “Okay,” she whispered after taking a second to process, “a bullet. Anything else?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio hesitated and cleared her throat quietly, “It would be easier if you could tell me what you’d like. What you want to try. Or else I’ll just be buying blind.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and Rio could feel her regressing in her comfort levels. Could feel her pulling away and then… she surprised her.</p><p>“I keep thinking about you on FaceTime with that pink thing. I keep thinking about using it on you. Controlling it. But…”</p><p>And here is where her cheeks were suddenly aflame and Rio frowned at the sight. “A strap-on. If you were comfortable with that. Big enough to make you… I mean… make me… I… something you would…”</p><p>She trailed off and Rio bit the inside of her cheek and took Agatha’s hand as she pulled away slowly and guided her back into the bedroom. “We’re just using these as visual aids, okay? Focus on the sizes and shapes and give me an idea of what to look for.”</p><p>It turned out to be a more painful exercise than Rio had imagined. Because Agatha had tensed up again as if even seeing the toys that Rio might have used with someone else was a personal attack. She was silent for a long time and Rio stood in her regret until eventually Agatha gritted out. “Something I can fuck you with that’ll make you forget anyone else.”</p><p>It hadn’t been the helpful response that Rio had been looking for but it was enough to go on. More than enough.</p><p>Not ten minutes later she was out the door after having trashed her old toys with no hesitation whatsoever.</p><p>She’d instructed Agatha to try to relax whilst she was away. She wanted this to be unstressful, for Agatha to get out of her head about it all, for it to be as romantic as possible.</p><p>But there wasn’t much that was romantic about rocking up in a baseball cap and sunglasses to the first sex shop she could find on google maps. It was mostly empty bar a single white male standing surreptitiously by the nipple clamps. But she didn’t think Agatha would be into that so he wouldn’t get in the way.</p><p>She took as much time as she thought she needed and eventually - making sure to buy the most expensive ones there, something she thought Agatha would appreciate - took a significant hit on her credit card and was out the door with a bulging bag that she hoped contained at least one thing Agatha would like.</p><p>When she got back she was practically vibrating with a mixture of nerves and stress that were immediately wiped out when she saw Agatha in a warrior post on a yoga mat behind the couch.</p><p>Wearing Rio’s sleep shorts.</p><p>And a bra.</p><p>“Jesus.”</p><p>“Hello to you too, honey.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she eyed Agatha some more and moved closer with the bag held aloft. She looked more relaxed. Her pink, flushed cheeks now through exertion rather than mortification. “I brought treats.”</p><p>Agatha smirked a little and then began to move into another position but Rio was already turning away for fear she’d stare and drool.</p><p>“I’m going to wash these in the bathroom and I’m going to run you a bath.”</p><p>“I already showered,” Agatha shouted after her as she disappeared down the hall.</p><p>“It’s to relax you!”</p><p>And Rio did just that. She commandeered the upstairs bathroom for project Clean Your Toys and then came back down the stairs to fill the larger tub for a bubble bath for Agatha. She used all the ingredients she’d found the day before including the candles she’d laid out on the sides, and even ran through to add a bottle of champagne and a bucket of ice for her.</p><p>Just as the water was rising to the right level she heard Agatha appear in the door. “I spoke to Jen earlier.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“I told her you were coming tomorrow but asked her not to tell Nicky.”</p><p>“What did she say?”</p><p>Agatha hummed and tugged Rio around so she could kiss her. “I think she was pleased she will have a day off.”</p><p>“From that kid? How could she possibly want a day off?”</p><p>This answer made Agatha grin and Rio was rewarded with another kiss, “I’m not sure Jen can hold a conversation about dinosaurs as well as you can.”</p><p>“Huh. Weird.”</p><p>Rio stepped from Agatha’s arms then and turned to stem the flow of water into the deep tub. “Champagne, candles, have I missed anything?”</p><p>“You, naked, already in the water?”</p><p>Rio smirked as she straightened and looped her arms around Agatha’s neck, “This is just a <em>you</em> bath.”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>Her waist was grabbed like Agatha was afraid she was going to bolt any second.</p><p>“I want you to relax. Get out of your head for a bit.”</p><p>“I am not in my head. I want to be <em>in</em> you.”</p><p>Rio smiled as Agatha frowned. “Look, your first strap is a big moment. And given you can’t really even talk about it I-…”</p><p>“Strap strap strap, is that better?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and sighed quietly, suddenly turning serious even as Agatha held her tighter and continued to frown. “I want this to be a good experience. Not just physically but emotionally too. I want you to feel totally comfortable or we’re not doing it.”</p><p>“You’re being ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little as Agatha’s frown turned into a scowl and she moved her elbows down to touch at Agatha’s tense jaw, tapping her lightly there as she studied over her face. “I am serious about us. And I hope you’re serious about us too.”</p><p>“All this over a few toys? Rio this is-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio insisted gently, “You are a queer person in a hetero marriage. An unhappy one. I’m not taking any of the steps we take together lightly. I want to do it right and I want you to feel safe and comfortable with me as we take them together.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and looked away, but her jaw felt a little less tense beneath the pads of her fingers and she slowly released a breath.</p><p>“Are <em>you</em> comfortable? Do you feel safe with me?”</p><p>Agatha looked back up then and in her eyes Rio saw none of the barriers she’d put in place since that morning. She saw only concern, only that little smudge of green in her soft gaze.</p><p>“Yes. Very comfortable, very safe.”</p><p>Agatha nodded then and her hold began to loosen as she skimmed her hands back around to press her knuckles gently into Rio’s stomach. She exhaled slowly, taking a few seconds as she stared at where her knuckles dug into Rio’s abdomen.</p><p>And Rio held her breath, held onto her fears and the little voice in her head that told her Agatha still wasn’t ready, would never leave Ralph.</p><p>“It feels wrong to want it. Sometimes I-… sometimes I can’t help but feel like I shouldn’t. But I do. And I want you so badly. When I’m with you the fear goes away but sometimes…”</p><p>Rio swallowed and took a second, sliding one hand down to rest on Agatha’s chest, letting her breathe for a while. But inside she burned. She pined. She perished.</p><p>“Sometimes it just feels like I’m bad.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly and closed her eyes for the smallest of moments.</p><p>“You are the furthest thing from bad. But, will you tell me when it starts to feel wrong? When you start to question it?”</p><p>Agatha only nodded and twisted the fabric of Rio’s shirt in her fingers, taking her time before she looked up into Rio’s sad eyes. “It mostly happens when I’m away from you for a while. I begin to question… it just spirals.”</p><p>Rio took a breath and felt her lungs burn again, felt her chest ache suddenly. When Agatha wasn’t with her she was with Ralph, or in the home share shared with him, in the life of a ‘happily married’ woman. She became the woman her mother had raised to <em>be</em> ‘happily married’ to an odious man who couldn’t even fuck her right, let alone love her right.</p><p>“You’ve lived a life hiding who you are, and what you want. And with me you don’t need to do that. And that… being yourself can never be <em>wrong</em>. <em>You</em> are not wrong. You’re not bad, my love.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her then, and Rio took a second to kiss her back but soon was, soon was clutching and grasping until Agatha broke away. “You’re too good for me.”</p><p>“And you are too harsh on yourself.”</p><p>Agatha shrank back a little and glanced at the bath, “All I know is, whenever I feel strange or <em>bad</em> or… whatever… thinking about you helps.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes partly in relief, partly in slight surprise. And then Agatha’s commanding hand was in her hair again, her other pulling her hips forwards, and she was kissing her firmly, letting her know she meant it.</p><p>Just as Agatha started it, she was the one the break it.</p><p>She pulled away and tenderly kissed Rio’s forehead before she rested against her temple. “Even when I’m… even scared I want you. Even unsure and… I know that now. I know that <em>this</em>, that <em>you</em> make me happy.”</p><p>Rio nodded a little, turning more into Agatha, “Okay, mi amor. Okay.”</p><p>“Seeing you on FaceTime the other night… I don’t think I’ve ever been more turned on.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew up her face slowly and she pulled away to look at Agatha properly seeing she still looked serious, “I mean it.”</p><p>“I believe you.”</p><p>“So you’ll let me?”</p><p>“Let you what, mi amor?”</p><p>And as Rio grinned widely Agatha narrowed her eyes, taking the opportunity to do her favourite thing and poke at Rio’s most sensitive spot, making her bark a laugh and heave forwards.</p><p>“Don’t do that!”</p><p>Humming in satisfaction Agatha stepped back and reached behind herself to undo her bra.</p><p>“You didn’t answer my question. What do you want to do?”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha smiled as she dropped the bra and shimmied out of Rio’s shorts. “Strap you down.”</p><p>“‘Strap me down’?” Rio repeated incredulously. “Where did you…? Have you been watching <em>porn</em>?!”</p><p>“I had to get it out of my system after that FaceTime. I was curious.”</p><p>Rio continued to gape even as she offered a hand to help Agatha step into the bath and watched as she lowered herself slowly in.</p><p>“Wait wait wait. Tell me exactly what you watched.”</p><p>“I thought I was supposed to be relaxing?”</p><p>“This is absolutely unfair. I can’t believe-!” But something about the evil glint in Agatha’s gaze made Rio come back to her senses and she growled a frustrated breath and closed her eyes for a second. “Okay. Okay. Relax. We’re relaxing now.”</p><p>“Are you going to get in?”</p><p>“No. This is for you. This is for you to…”</p><p>Agatha had splashed her.</p><p>“We were just having a very serious and important conversation and then you manipulated it round to… to…”</p><p>Agatha grinned innocently up at her and Rio lost her train of thought as she reclined back and her breasts peaked above the bubbles. “To what?”</p><p>“<em>You</em> are the irritating one.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled but seemed to <em>actually</em> relax as Rio came to perch on the side of the tub and pop the champagne for her, muttering under her breath about just <em>how</em> irritating Agatha was.</p><p>“It’s happening less, you know.”</p><p>“What is?”</p><p>The bottle popped, Rio winced.</p><p>“The thoughts. The fear. It’s not really happened in a while.”</p><p>Rio nodded sagely, pouring for Agatha. “When was the last time?”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while and Rio turned to her with her glass held out and saw the hesitance written like a script across her soft features.</p><p>“London.”</p><p>Rio counted back in her head. Two weeks ago. The BAFTAs.</p><p>A bad night for both of them, it turned out.</p><p>“Okay. And not since?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio smiled sadly as she passed the flute to Agatha and reached over to brush her cheek, “Try to relax, okay? I want tonight to be romantic. Take your time.”</p><p>Agatha leant into the touch but sighed a little, “Won’t you join? Just for a while?”</p><p>“I have to set up.”</p><p>“Set up? What exactly are you setting up?”</p><p>“It’ll be perfect, just relax.”</p><p>Agatha sighed again and Rio grinned, giving Agatha a soft kiss before she pulled back.</p><p>“Take your time.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you won’t get in here with me.”</p><p>Rio grinned some more and leant down again to kiss Agatha sweetly, but found when she pulled back that Agatha was scowling now, and she knew she’d thought she’d change her mind.</p><p>“It’ll be worth it, I promise. Lay back. Relax. Drink your champagne.”</p><p>“Riooooo.”</p><p>Rio laughed and had been standing and turning around when she looked back at Agatha expectantly. But she almost stumbled when she saw what she was doing.</p><p>Agatha was pouting obnoxiously, had taken the soapy suds made from the bubbles and was rubbing them slowly, gratuitously over her tits. Rio almost collapsed on the spot.</p><p>“No! No no no!” She stumbled blindly from the room instead.</p><p>The much more dignified option.</p><p>Just as she slipped from the door Agatha cackled and shouted after her, “Pathetic!”</p><p>And Rio only laughed, only rubbed her face, and groaned as she closed the door on possibly one of the sexiest, brattiest, things she’d ever seen.</p><p>But she had work to do.</p><p>She’d spent all week thinking about having a truly romantic night with Agatha, and tonight was it. Besides, after the brief blip this morning, and the intensity of their conversation, it needed to be.</p><p>Agatha needed romance. And they both needed the reassurance.</p><p>So she set about finding more candles, grabbing as many throws and blankets as she could carry. For the majority of her setup time she felt a lot like a packhorse. But a million blankets and pillows were necessary.</p><p>It had to be comfortable, had to be cosy, had to be perfect.</p><p>She lay everything down by the fire, taking pains to ensure it wasn’t too far, nor too close. She tested where the cushions were, adding more in some areas and less in others. Until, finally, she’d created a makeshift pool made out of thick layers of blankets and surrounded by cushions and pillows at every angle.</p><p>Soft places to land, wherever you looked.</p><p>Next came the candles, which she lit and placed everywhere that felt like they’d be safe enough away from anything that might cause a fire.</p><p>Then, she fetched a clean towel, lay it on one end of the couch, placed her new purchases, all clean and ready for use.</p><p>And finally, she took herself off to change into a little magnolia slip that she’d scurried away in her duffel. She took her time perfecting her hair, adding volume to it with her fingers so it hung casually about her shoulders. She added a little mascara to her otherwise makeup-free face, but pinched her cheeks and bit her lips to rosy them up.</p><p>Her legs were silky smooth from the after-shower moisturiser she’d applied that morning but she added a spritz of perfume just to be sure she smelt good.</p><p>She padded back down to her creation and poured two glasses of champagne from the bottle on ice by the side, took a sip for courage, and then lay supine in the nest and rested on her elbows as she waited for Agatha to arrive.</p><p>It had been timed perfectly. Agatha turned the corner into the room not five minutes after Rio was ready.</p><p>Rio smiled up at her, demurely rubbing her foot over her opposite calf, wondering if Agatha were as surprised by what she’d walked in on as she hoped she was.</p><p>“Sorpresa, mi amor. ¿Te gusta?”</p><p>And far from the woman who had been obstinate, demanding, earlier. This Agatha was suddenly shy, suddenly silent.</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio trilled softly, smiling as she watched Agatha take it all in and nothing but the crackling of the fire interrupted them.</p><p>Tonight would be a night of firsts. Not like their first time together that had been rushed, unsure, desperate.</p><p>Tonight would be slow and sensual, and sexy. And Rio wouldn’t rush Agatha. She wanted her to feel wooed and romanced and safe.</p><p>So she remained still, not moving to her. Not yet.</p><p>Agatha took in the setup, then returned her gaze to Rio, and she moved over. She stepped over the low wall of cushions and Rio’s smile eased as she lowered down to her knees before her and slowly crawled up her body, now just a breath away from her lips.</p><p>“All of this? For me?”</p><p>“Always all for you.”</p><p>Rio nudged their noses together and slowly lowered herself down and Agatha shifted to hover fully above her, her long hair now down and forming a curtain around them as she balanced her weight on her right hand and used her left to trace the line of Rio’s collarbone.</p><p>“I could get used to this.”</p><p>“Then do,” Rio offered, fighting the shiver that came when Agatha’s touches moved down her chest.</p><p>“If the fire gets too hot,” Rio began as Agatha started to kiss slowly along her jaw, “we can move.”</p><p>“No. This is perfect.” Agatha raised up again and smiled, her left hand curling around Rio’s waist, “It’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio hummed a grin as Agatha finally kissed her, finally closing the distance and pressed her body down over her own. She was still wrapped in a bath robe, still too covered for Rio’s liking. But they shifted together as they kissed, wordlessly knowing how to move to slip Agatha’s arm free of the robe, then her other, until Rio could tug it off totally and toss it aside.</p><p>Agatha’s skin smelt of lavender and she traced the planes of her naked back as they kissed slowly, languidly by the fire.</p><p>When they broke for breath Agatha was smiling again, her back arched a little as her forearms rested by Rio’s head. “I missed you in the bath.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“Well I wanted you to relax so I could make this special for us.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again and Rio grinned into it, “Did you bring…?”</p><p>“They’re on the couch. You didn’t see them?”</p><p>“I was a little distracted by the woman in the slip waiting for me by the fire.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled as Agatha pulled back to lean to one side and move her hand down to trace the outline of her nipple through the soft material. “Mmm, well… tell me what you want to do.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a second, her soft touch with just her finger changing as she rolled to her side fully beside Rio and traced her hand slowly down her body. “I’d rather just <em>do</em>, actually.”</p><p>Rio smirked and made a show of lifting her chest, which made Agatha’s eyes dart down to it just as her fingers grazed her inner thigh. “I’m all yours, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond but leant in and Rio was soon gasping beneath her as Agatha trailed her lips down to the frill of her chemise. Agatha was slow with everything, and Rio was glad of it, glad she was taking her time to work her way down her body, simultaneously pushing the silk to gather at Rio’s hips.</p><p>Agatha’s lips left no amount of flesh untouched and Rio was soon painted with their soft touch. Her slip had been lifted off her, both of them moving again in tandem without speaking any words.</p><p>By the time Rio was naked and panting delicately with Agatha settled between her legs, her hands on her breasts, her tongue tracing a line between them, Rio felt like she’d never wanted anybody more.</p><p>It was warm and Agatha was warmer on top of her but Rio could only feel the heat between her thighs as Agatha began to work her way down again.</p><p>She was slow still, indulgent. She let her tongue taste and her lips trace and even nipped lightly at the soft flesh of her stomach below her belly button. And Rio began to whine quietly, groaning a little until she lost her breath as she felt Agatha’s breath against her core.</p><p>Slow as she was, she didn’t hesitate. Agatha tasted Rio’s desire for her with a quiet moan of her own and eagerly pressed a finger inside of her, feeling Rio rock her hips slowly as she lapped at her with her tongue.</p><p>“J’aimerais avoir mon Oscar.” <em>I wish I had my Oscar.</em> Agatha mumbled the words against her, and Rio looked down to see Agatha’s eyes were on her, her mouth fully open again making sure Rio could see as she took a thick swipe at her with her tongue.</p><p>“Fuck,” was all Rio could say to that, guessing the meaning behind Agatha’s words. “Fuck French is so…”"</p><p>But Agatha was thrusting into her with a second finger, prizing her open slowly by scissoring them, now applying delicate kitten lips over her beaded clit.</p><p>Despite her teasing of Agatha coming so quickly all week, Rio barely held on for three minutes. Agatha had worked her up so much before she’d even properly touched her that Rio was helpless below her as she came hard against her mouth.</p><p>Agatha was reluctant to let her breathe as she removed her fingers slowly and sucked them off, in full view of Rio. And Rio only moaned at the sight, barely cognisant, as she lay prone and Agatha ducked her head back down to swirl her tongue through her once more, easing her way down to press into her properly.</p><p>When Agatha eventually crawled back over her, her face was wet with Rio. She looked ravenous, not yet satisfied. “I need to be inside you. I feel…” She stopped herself and Rio frowned a little, raising her heavy hand up to her cheek, “I feel…”</p><p>“It’s okay, baby.”</p><p>Agatha huffed gently and briefly turned away.</p><p>“You brought a strap-on?”</p><p>Rio smiled but tried not to let it grow too wide in case Agatha thought she was making fun. She nodded and motioned with her head to the couch. “A few. I didn’t know what size you wanted or colour or…”</p><p>She trailed off as Agatha sat back slowly onto her ankles and looked to the couch where everything lay neatly on the towel.</p><p>“Do you… have a preference?”</p><p>Rio sat slowly and smiled as she reached up to gently wipe Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“I’ll take whatever you give me, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little and she turned to look down at Rio who was now grinning up at her. “I want you to be comfortable.”</p><p>Rio nodded and began to rub gently along Agatha’s thighs. “I’ll tell you if I’m not, okay? We can-…”</p><p>“No.” Rio raised her brows at the firmness in Agatha’s voice and stopped the motion of her hands as Agatha held her head. “I don’t want you to get hurt or for you not to enjoy or-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured, fighting the emotion in her voice as she realised the issue here. The issue being Ralph.</p><p>Agatha had only had sex with him, and one other before him. Both men. She couldn’t speak for the other guy but from knowing what she did about Ralph, she knew he wasn’t a generous or even considerate lover.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t attracted to him. She assumed Agatha wasn’t even attracted to <em>men</em>.</p><p>So sex with one, sex with Ralph, wasn’t comfortable.</p><p>And Agatha wanted Rio to not feel the way she felt with him.</p><p>And Rio loved her <em>so much</em> for it.</p><p>“I need you to know that I am <em>so</em> attracted to you. That you make me <em>so</em> wet. That nothing you can do would make me hurt or uncomfortable and if on the off chance it was ever too much, I would tell you immediately and I know you’d stop or move or change something. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and Rio smiled for the slight blush across her cheeks.</p><p>“Would it help if we used safewords?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth and closed it again and Rio saw a shyness in her gaze that made her chest constrict. “Okay, let’s just… you pick whatever you want and we can go from there.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated and then kissed Rio softly before she stood from her lap and went to look. Rio watched her with a sad smile, trying to force her brain to focus, and not to think about the nights Agatha would have endured being uncomfortable or hurt below a rutting Ralph.</p><p>It took a while, Agatha simply stared for a while. But then she began to cautiously touch, she felt the weight of each thing, randomly at one point slapped a vibrator against her hand.</p><p>It was fascinating to watch. She looked curious rather than scared now. And when she’d made her choice Rio smiled because <em>obviously</em> she’d picked the purple one.</p><p>She held the harness too and raised her brows at Rio as she waited for her approval. “Would this one be-…?”</p><p>“It’s perfect. Now hurry up and fuck me, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but Rio caught her grin as she laid back down and warmed her body by the fire. She stretched out and hummed softly, soon calming herself as she anticipated seeing the sight of Agatha strapped up.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the soft weight of the woman to be back over her, with an added appendage, and Rio grinned as she reached down to Agatha’s hips to feel that she’d secure to herself.</p><p>“Jesus,” she murmured with a frown as Agatha blinked and pulled back from where she’d been kissing her neck. “Agatha,” Rio said softly, moving her hands to push at her to encourage her to sit up.</p><p>Agatha did and was frowning, her cheeks bright red already as Rio shuffled to slide from underneath her and rock up to her knees.</p><p>“Stand for me.”</p><p>Agatha struggled to her feet and turned her head away as Rio sighed and raised her hands back to her hips. “Baby, doesn’t it hurt? <em>How</em> have you tied it this tight?”</p><p>Rio looked down at the black harness attached so tightly to Agatha’s hips that the skin that bubbled around it already looked red. She huffed quietly as she moved to loosen it for her.</p><p>“This is so not sexy.” Agatha grumbled as Rio smiled a little and adjusted the straps over her right hip.</p><p>“Perhaps if you hadn’t decided to cut off your own blood supply…”</p><p>Agatha huffed and Rio glanced up to see her cheeks were still that glorious ruby red. She finished adjusting over her right hip and kissed her there softly before shuffling to her left.</p><p>“I didn’t want it to fall.”</p><p>“You’re not bungee jumping, baby.”</p><p>“I wanted to get it right.”</p><p>Rio looked up as she made the final adjustments and saw the obstinate turn of Agatha’s head, the firm defiance in her gaze as she stared straight ahead of herself. And it made her fall impossibly harder for her.</p><p>She kissed her hip again, lingering there for a few seconds before she pulled away.</p><p>“Okay, how does it feel?”</p><p>“Stupid.”</p><p>Rio smiled and raised her brows, “We don’t have to do this, you know.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond but her jaw flexed and Rio knew that was all she’d be getting on that.</p><p>So Rio shuffled round on her knees, resting back against her ankles in front of Agatha and wrapped her dominant hand around the purple strap.</p><p>She waited to see if Agatha would look but she seemed to be particularly interested in the fire now, still crackling away beside them. Rio smiled, Rio considered, Rio leant in and wrapped her lips around the tip of the strap, wondering how long it would take for-…</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio smiled with her mouth full and slowly pulled back.</p><p>“I can’t feel it.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and began to slowly jerk the dildo off, keeping her gaze up on Agatha who was now watching Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Rio, I can’t feel it.”</p><p>“I know, baby. Just get out of your head, okay?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Is this sexy to you? Me kneeling before you, jerking you off?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath and Rio smiled a little when her cheeks tinged that bright red again. “Baby, get out of your head, just focus on me, okay? On the way what I’m doing makes you feel.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled where she’d been leaning in again and she pulled back slowly, “Okay. I don’t have-…”</p><p>“I didn’t say stop.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened and she went back to it. She slowly leant in, and found Agatha’s left hand was grazing her cheek and then brushing back the hair from her face. She closed her eyes at the touch and welcomed the tip of the strap back into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s hand remained on her head, her fingers curling into her hair as Rio pushed closer, taking Agatha almost all the way in and forcing a moan to see if she’d get a reaction.</p><p>Agatha’s hold tightened. She heard her gasp.</p><p>Rio pulled back slowly and raised her gaze up to the woman above her, grinning after playfully licking the mushroomed head. “And?”</p><p>“I… need to be inside you. With this. Now.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and placed a soft, lingering kiss to the strap before she moved backwards and lowered herself back down again.</p><p>She lay flat for a while and watched as Agatha grabbed the lube and put on what Rio considered to be an inordinate amount over the strap.</p><p>She raised her brows and leant up on her elbows to watch Agatha as she grabbed the lube again and applied another dollop to the strap, now shining with slick, practically dribbling it onto the blankets.</p><p>“Baby, you don’t need that much.”</p><p>“I’m making sure.”</p><p>“Making sure of what?”</p><p>Rio sat slowly, took Agatha’s wrists and directed her to wipe her the excess lube she’d just rubbed in onto her stomach. Agatha sighed, her gaze down on the abs she now stroked delicately, “I just want to make sure you’re comfortable.”</p><p>Rio smiled and took hold of Agatha’s wrists again, feeling the pang of Agatha’s concern. She brought one hand up to her lips to kiss her wet palm and grimaced as she pulled away with traces of lubricant across her lips and chin. “I think you already know how much I want you. I can take it, I promise. I’ll tell you at any point if it’s sore.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, looked vaguely dumbfounded for a second as her gaze fell to Rio’s shiny chin before she looked back between them and looked serious once more.</p><p>Rio decided this was a side to Agatha she could get used to. Overly concerned, overly protective, overly aware of how Rio might be feeling. She focused on that part of Agatha’s reaction, rather than the cause of it. She smiled as she lay down fully again and let her fingers run infinity symbols over the sticky skin of her abdomen as she waited patiently for Agatha to get up the courage to do what she wanted her desperately to do.</p><p>Rio kept her gaze on the ceiling, deciding Agatha might want even a semblance of privacy as she deliberated and waited.</p><p>It happened slowly, as Rio knew it would, at least at first.</p><p>She felt the smooth, hard head of the dildo press experimentally against her. She glanced down. Agatha’s hair had fallen over one shoulder, giving Rio a full view of her tense jaw as she focused in.</p><p>She felt her heart rate pickup as Agatha began to roll her hips, still guiding the toy with her hand, making it rub lengthways against Rio’s pussy.</p><p>She whimpered, eyes wide, watching the concentration across pale features.</p><p>Agatha’s lips had parted, her eyes darker than Rio had ever seen them. She looked unlike herself and yet the most herself she’d ever been.</p><p>She pressed the strap head inside Rio, and Rio felt the exquisite stretch of it already, the slow burn of Agatha holding still, barely giving her anything and still setting her body on fire.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, lifting her head slightly and straining her neck to look at where Agatha still held still, barely inside of her. “Are you trying to torture me?”</p><p>Agatha looked up slowly, raised her brows. Rio smiled at the sight and was about to lift up to her elbows when Agatha’s lips parted and she gasped out as she began to move her hips. It was tantalisingly slow, and Rio gasped as she fell back again, her back straining to arch already as Agatha finally pushed in fully and their hips rested flush together.</p><p>She’d pressed seven inches inside of her. And Rio felt fuller than she’d been in a long time. But full of Agatha, which was better than any feeling in the world.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and groaned quietly, daring to look down at Agatha whose eyes were trained on where their hips met. Her lips were parted still, her tongue darting out to wet them and Rio could have cried for the sight, the image of Agatha so entranced by her cock buried in her for the first time.</p><p>Agatha’s hand moved fluidly through the air, as if she were deliberating as she moved it, unsure where it was going to land. It briefly brushed Rio’s stomach, her finger tips just grazing her skin. Then it moved to her hips and rested there as she pressed a little harder into her and Rio whimpered.</p><p>Agatha’s dark eyes flashed up to meet Rio’s and the yellow red flames of the fire reflected in them, making Agatha look mythical and dangerous. She was breathing heavily, her bare chest rising and falling as Rio whined and stirred her hips. “You gotta pull out, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha obliged, but slowly, dropping her gaze to the movement as she did.</p><p>She was about halfway pulled out when she flexed her fingers at Rio’s hips and muttered something under her breath.</p><p>Rio was panting heavily now, gripping the blanket to try and stop herself from moving, her eyes back up on the ceiling.</p><p>She wanted Agatha to take her time, to figure out what she liked, what she didn’t, if she even liked anything about this at all. And just as Rio was moving out of her body and into her anxious mind she heard something that pulled her right back.</p><p>“You look so beautiful like this.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze down to Agatha, and gasped at the sight. She’d pulled out more fully now, only an inch of the purple strap now remained inside her but Agatha was staring at her, her fiery gaze fierce but somehow tender as her thumb brushed over the sensitive skin at Rio’s hips.</p><p>Rio bit down on lip as a tear rolled down from the outer corner of her eye and she gasped again as Agatha pulled out and leant over her to brush it away.</p><p>“Are you okay? Did I hurt you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head quickly, knocking Agatha’s hand from her face and she swallowed before she released a laugh, surprised at her own reaction.</p><p>“No. No. No! Not at all. I just… you caught me off guard.”</p><p>Agatha frowned a little but didn’t let Rio see it for long as she ducked down to kiss her tenderly, soon dragging her lips down her jaw, journeying back down her body until she hit her lower abdomen and kissed finally just below her belly button.</p><p>Rio gasped at the gentleness of Agatha, at the slowness of her, at her taking her time again as she  moved her hand to press into Rio slowly with two fingers, making Rio’s gasps turn to soft moans as Agatha watched her again.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha. Please.”</p><p>She looked down and Agatha was smiling, was already pulling out again, already moving up to hover over her and reaching down to reposition.</p><p>“Kiss me,” Agatha commanded softly. And when Rio obliged, she gasped into Agatha’s mouth as she began to press into her again.</p><p>Everything still slow, everything still soft.</p><p>Agatha adjusted, figuring out how best to hold herself against Rio as she kissed her. And gradually, as she gained in confidence, Rio’s soft moans only helping, she began to roll her hips to fuck her properly.</p><p>Rio raised her legs up to pull Agatha closer to her, to get her in deeper.</p><p>But Agatha kept the same slow pace, enjoying the noises Rio was making, the desperation of her tongue.</p><p>When Rio broke the kiss Agatha looked down between them and Rio began to groan as her thrusts became heavier, and Rio’s body moved with every one.</p><p>She reached down between them and with some difficulty rubbed her fingers against her clit, the mess of the lube and her own need making it difficult to get purchase. But Agatha watching her, Agatha inside her, Agatha <em>fucking</em> her, meant it didn’t matter.</p><p>She came with a strangled cry that Agatha captured on her tongue. She felt herself clench around Agatha’s strap, felt the heaviness of her movements inside her, heard Agatha moan quietly when she tried to press in deeper again, their hips now fully flush, Agatha’s body slowly sagging against Rio’s.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Rio chanted quietly, catching her breath as she slid the hand out that had been trapped between them and rubbed up and down Agatha’s side.</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while but kissed Rio softly, her hips jerking every so often until Rio began to whine a little and asked her to pull out. She did, easily slipping out now as she pulled out fully and Rio glanced down at the shining, soaked strap and laughed at the sight of it, her dazed brain slowly catching up to what had just happened.</p><p>But Agatha was kneeling above her, watching her for a second before she began to fumble her way out of the harness. By the time she was free, Rio had calmed her laughter and was sighing heavily as she stretched out against the blankets, shifting a little to get away from the wet patch beneath her.</p><p>Agatha pulled her back, wrapping an arm around her waist as she curled around her, pressing her hot face into Rio’s warm neck. “Was it okay?”</p><p>“More than, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha nodded but remained hidden and Rio jostled them until she could turn to her side and duck down to see Agatha properly. “Was it okay for you?”</p><p>But Agatha didn’t need to say anything for Rio to know.</p><p>A slow, smug smile crept up her face and Agatha caught it and rolled her eyes. “You already know.”</p><p>“Tell me,” Rio insisted, tugging Agatha closer. She reached for Agatha’s thigh to tug it over her hip and gave herself access to reach down between them to feel <em>exactly</em> how it made Agatha feel. “How do you feel?”</p><p>She grinned as Agatha released a soft breath and her lashes fluttered as Rio danced her fingers casually over soaked curls at the mound of her pussy, pushing further down to run through her folds, “Mi amor?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were closed now, her breath hitching slightly when Rio brushed over her clit.</p><p>“It <em>feels</em> like you liked it.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out, a soft, high-pitched noise escaping her as Rio applied a little more pressure, “Por favor, calláte.” <em>Please shut up.</em></p><p>Rio smirked as she purposefully gasped and made Agatha open her eyes to look at her just as she slipped two fingers inside of her. Agatha’s hips jolted involuntarily and Rio grinned as she curled her fingers and began to pump in and out.</p><p>“You liked it. A lot.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips but huffed through her nose, and moved her hand up to hold Rio’s cheek, “You’re so irritating.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha leant in to kiss her and everything slowed down again. Everything was intense but unhurried. And when Agatha came, she came fast, loud against Rio’s mouth, insistent with her hips, but gentle with the hands that held Rio’s face close.</p><p>“There’s a blue one,” Agatha said quietly after she’d caught her breath, already making pains to nudge Rio’s nose with her own, keeping her close still, “kinda shaped like a fishhook.”</p><p>“Mm?” Rio asked with a grin, already knowing the one Agatha meant but enjoying the image of a navy blue, silicone fishhook. “You want to use it?”</p><p>“How-? I mean…”</p><p>“It’s strapless,” Rio said gently, no hint of amusement in her tone now as she kissed Agatha softly, trying not to embarrass her. “The curved end goes in one person and the dildo goes…”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said quietly, her cheeks blushing a soft pink rather than the deep red they had been earlier.</p><p>“Could we try?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio pulled back but Agatha grabbed her before she could move fully away and pulled her back in to kiss her firmly, a move more rushed than anything they’d done that day. Rio smiled into it, grateful for it, before Agatha released her again and she went to grab the toy.</p><p>She brought it back and took the initiative to wipe herself and cover the internal bulb with the wetness now on her hand. Just as she was moving to adjust Agatha’s legs Agatha stopped her and held her wrist gently, “No, I… I want to go on top.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and moved to her knees before Rio. “Let me ride you.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Not Rio’s coolest response to being told that but her most natural one. She swallowed and was quick to open her legs more to position the toy when Agatha reached to take it and took over instead.</p><p>Without being prompted to she reached between her thighs and pressed a finger inside her and Rio bit down on her lip at the look on Agatha’s face. She looked sure this time, far more at ease with what she was doing. She added a second finger and Rio had to close her eyes, feeling Agatha stretch her out before she pressed the toy against her and replaced her fingers with it.</p><p>Rio tried her best not to whine, not to beg for more when Agatha pulled away and carefully pressed the toy into her. Rio shifted until she was comfortable and leant away to reach for the lube off to the side.</p><p>“Will you spit?”</p><p>Her fingers had just made contact with the sticky bottle when she turned to Agatha in surprise and raised her brows. “On?”</p><p>“The dildo, Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she leant back, and moved to stand and go to sit on the edge of the couch. Agatha watched from her position with her back to the fire and Rio made sure she could see clearly as she spat into her open hand.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>Agatha moved over, pink-cheeked and cautious, she settled delicately on Rio’s lap and blinked down at the spit still in a pool in Rio’s palm.</p><p>“Escupe, mi amor.” <em>Spit, my love.</em></p><p>Agatha did so and Rio smiled as she held her hip, making sure she was steady as she covered the erect cock in their mixed saliva. She then turned her hand to wipe over Agatha’s pussy, making sure she was as wet as possible, wanting to prove she was a conscientious lover, even when she felt her desperation to be inside Agatha begin to take over her thinking mind.</p><p>“Feeling okay?”</p><p>Agatha only nodded as she reached down to grab the strap, making Rio twitch a little as it moved inside her. She stilled and waited, checking Rio was okay before she lifted her hips and Rio watched as she positioned herself above it, lining it up before she lowered herself and Rio saw the tip disappear inside her.</p><p>“God, fuck.”</p><p>Rio’s hold was tight on Agatha’s hips and she clenched her thighs to keep the toy secure as Agatha controlled her descent and slowly took her all the way in.</p><p>Rio gaped at where she’d disappeared inside her, groaned as Agatha rocked her hips a little, and shifted to ensure she was tight around the toy.</p><p>“Fuck, you took that so fucking well.”</p><p>But Rio lost the ability to think as Agatha began to ride her. It was slow at first, Agatha using Rio’s shoulders for balance, her head thrown back with every roll of her hips.</p><p>God bless Pilates. God bless Agatha <em>fucking</em> Harkness.</p><p>Rio just watched, held Agatha steady, but let her take control, let her fuck herself on Rio’s cock. Let her bounce and roll and moan until she came when all Rio had done was hold her hips.</p><p>And Agatha whined as she adjusted, pressing her hips down as Rio pushed up. It was risky, her thighs were sore from the tension of making sure she kept the toy in place, but nothing slipped and the look on Agatha’s flushed face was worth it.</p><p>She was panting heavily, unabashedly, now clutching at Rio’s hair, resting their foreheads together.</p><p>“Such a quick trigger,” Rio teased with a dazed smile as Agatha rolled her eyes and slowly lifted off of her.</p><p>“Mm. So smug.”</p><p>A pale hand reached between them and Rio groaned quietly when Agatha pulled the toy from between Rio’s legs and tossed it aside.</p><p>“Good practice is to try to keep those <em>off</em> the floor.”</p><p>“I won’t be using it again.”</p><p>“You didn’t like it?”</p><p>“I want to see how much <em>you</em> liked it.”</p><p>It took another two orgasms against Agatha’s mouth for her to be satisfied enough to tug Rio back into the blankets with her. For her to close her eyes and tangle herself in Rio’s limbs.</p><p>And Rio was so punch-drunk when all she’d had was a sip of champagne.</p><p>Rio breathed Agatha in deeply, the smell of her perfume, the heady scent of sex, it all mingled together into something delicious, something precious. She allowed it to wash over her, to fill her up, to strengthen her resolve as she asked: “You told me before that Ralph had never made you come. But you came from just riding me. Did you lie before?”</p><p>She moved the hand that curled around Agatha’s ribcage slowly down to rest over her hip as she lifted her head to look at her. Agatha was shifting slightly, but didn’t look away when Rio met her gaze. “No. Sex with Ralph… it was uncomfortable. He takes a while to come and… I just never enjoyed it.”</p><p>Rio nodded, felt the fire ignite in her belly as she remembered a conversation from long ago: <em>Ralph never tried.</em></p><p>But her eyes fluttered closed as Agatha raised her hand to brush her fingers across her cheek. “It was just always missionary, always perfunctory, always what I thought it should be.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and looked to Agatha again, seeing the confusion in the way her brow knit together, the way her blue eyes darted about Rio’s face. “I didn’t know.”</p><p>“If sex is ever, with us, not what you want. I want you to-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha uttered quickly, sadly, “I will never not want you.”</p><p>And Rio hoped Agatha meant in <em>every</em> way, not just the naked and breathless ways. But Agatha didn’t say anything to clarify and let the words hang in the air as she continued to caress Rio’s cheek.</p><p>They fell asleep like that. Calm like that. At ease and warmed by the fire.</p><p>It was Agatha this time who moved them to the bedroom around one in the morning. Agatha who sourced their phones, noted they’d both died from lack of use and the forgetfulness of two women too embroiled in each other to bother with boring things like charging.</p><p>She tucked a half-asleep Rio in and this time rolled her over so she was over her, and they both drifted off tangled in one another’s arms.</p>

<h4>Saturday</h4><p>The sun was high in the sky as Rio reclined on the bed overlooking the hills with the bay beyond.</p><p>Agatha was there because of course she was.</p><p>Her pale, attentive fingers were running gently through Rio’s hair and the world was good. Their day was just beginning. Her coffee-warmed hands rested now, absently tapping out a soft pattern across her stomach.</p><p>Birdsong nearby was all that disturbed them.</p><p>And then Agatha’s hand moved from her hair to her shoulder and the light touch became firmer, somehow insistent.</p><p>And Rio woke with a start.</p><p>“Rio. Honey.”</p><p>“Five minutes,” Rio mumbled, tugging the sheets up to her face, intent on blocking out the soft light of the morning, wanting to be back on the warm balcony where no one needed to be anywhere in particular.</p><p>“No, baby, wake up. I need to go.”</p><p>Rio frowned some more, took a second, allowed the sheets to be removed from her face.</p><p>When had <em>we</em> become <em>I</em>?</p><p>“Wait, wait, I’m sorry. I’ll get up. Give me five minutes. I’ll shower, and-…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were open now as she’d moved to scramble up, assuming Agatha was wanting to get going and Rio was holding her back. But Agatha was frowning, was looking desolate, distraught, even. She was already dressed in Rio’s white knitted sweater.</p><p>Rio rubbed her eyes to make sure she wasn’t imagining it. To make sure Agatha wasn’t pulling some cruel trick. To make sure what she was seeing was real: her happy, calm, satiated lover was suddenly looking torn apart.</p><p>“Baby.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha crouched down by the edge of the bed, felt the gentleness of that hand that had taken her own, the fingers that curled around her ankle as she sat up properly and swung her legs over the edge.</p><p>“I have to go without you. Jen tried calling last night but my cell was dead. I-…”</p><p>“What’s wrong? Is Nicky okay?”</p><p>“He’s fine.” Agatha sighed and dropped her gaze and Rio pulled her hand up to kiss over her knuckles.</p><p>“Then give me five, and-…”</p><p>“Rio, my mother arrived late last night.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“I can’t bring you with me because… it would just be too hard to have you there with her.”</p><p><em>Evanora</em></p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, closing her eyes. She felt Agatha lean up, felt her squeeze over her calf, “I wanted a day for us. I really did.”</p><p>Rio believed her. But she didn’t understand why they still couldn’t have one. Why Agatha would let her mother get between them.</p><p>“I’m still coming,” Rio said firmly, opening her eyes to look down at a frowning Agatha. “I’ll still spend time with you both. I want to see Nicky. I want to be with <em>you</em>.”</p><p>For a second it looked like Agatha might give in. Her blue eyes disappeared behind dark lashes and she pressed her face into Rio’s thigh, giving Rio the opportunity to do as Agatha had done to her in her dream.</p><p>Rio let Agatha take a second, heard her breathe in slowly and exhale as she lifted her head again and Rio’s fingers that had been buried in dark hair were pushed away.</p><p>And as soon as she saw her face she knew what she was about to say.</p><p>“No,” Agatha whispered, moving her hand to reach for Rio’s free one. “No, I’m going alone.”</p><p>“Mi amor, I can handle your mom, okay? I can-…”</p><p>“I’m telling you no, Rio. I can’t have you there with her. I won’t.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“Please understand this. Please just wait here and I’ll be back later tonight, okay? And we can pick back up where we left off. Just the two of us.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and felt the sting of rejection in Agatha’s request. She’d thought they were moving forwards, that Agatha inviting her to her day with Nicky was a positive sign that she wanted her involved.</p><p>That maybe there was room for her in her life.</p><p>But she didn’t want her to meet Evanora. She didn’t want her to meet the woman who’d birthed her but had not raised her. Her <em>mother</em>, not her <em>mom</em>.</p><p>“I want to come with you,” was all she could get out, all she could respond with as Agatha dropped her hold on her hands and reached to pull her down into a soft kiss, like the ones they gave each other when they were leaving for only minutes - only this time it would be a whole day.</p><p>“I know, baby. I know.”</p><p>Agatha smiled sadly and Rio watched as she pulled away, stood up, and left.</p><p>A great, unbearable ache blossomed in her chest now, its creeping tendrils constricted her lungs. It took root in her chest where it would insidiously suckle at her heart for the rest of the day, spreading its poison into her bloodstream, promising the fears that had dissolved with Agatha’s tenderness would come back again.</p><p>And Rio tried to breath in slowly, tried to calm it as she heard the front door open and close.</p><p>But Agatha was gone. Their day together wasn’t happening. She’d have to wait.</p><p>She waited by cleaning, by making their home spotless again. She tidied away the candles she’d laid out yesterday.</p><p>She organised the throws and blankets she’d gathered.</p><p>She took out the empty glass bottles that had been piling up through the week.</p><p>And then, after she’d showered and changed, she found her script and curled up to read through it.</p><p>She didn’t get very far. She read and she had to reread. So much so that after an hour of trying she only managed three pages. Reading about a happy family, instead of being with one, wasn’t the best cure for her ills.</p><p>Her mind was on that family. On Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>Her thoughts were constantly with Agatha, on the pained expression that had been on her face, on the fact that Evanora had forced them apart when she’d not even stepped into the room.</p><p>But another hour of failed script reading later and her phone lit up with a text from Agatha.</p><p>10:37am<br/>
Agatha Harkness: I’m home safe.</p><p>10:38am<br/>
Rio Vidal: Let me know if you need anything. Tell Nicky I said hey</p><p>Rio stared at the WhatsApp interface, watching it in the hopes that Agatha would read her message and respond immediately.</p><p>But the ticks went blue and she heard nothing back.</p><p>Rio worried all day. She even debated messaging Jen to see if Agatha were okay but she didn’t want Agatha to think she were interfering.</p><p>So she sat. She drove herself crazy. She tried to eat something, but stress prevented her from even that.</p><p>She did some yoga but even in downward dog her thoughts wouldn’t right themselves.</p><p>She showered again.</p><p>She eventually got so hungry she ate ice cream directly from the tub. And an apple - to try and get some vitamins.</p><p>And then, at around 9pm, her phone rang.</p><p>“Agatha? Are you okay? Are you on your way back?”</p><p>“No, Rio.” Agatha’s voice was barely a whisper, and Rio’s heart sank. “I have to stay.”</p><p>Rio nodded into the phone, feeling the roots that had buried in her chest flare with their earlier promise: this was it, this was all she’d ever get with Agatha. Four days of bliss before reality stole her back.</p><p>She bit her lip. She took a second.</p><p>“What’s happened? Is she-…?”</p><p>“She’s gone. She caught the five o’clock flight home. But…” there was a noise at the end of the line and Rio strained to hear more, to try and figure out what it was.</p><p>Then she heard the soft sounds of a door being closed.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Soft breaths.</p><p>Another door.</p><p>The sound of fabric against wood.</p><p>A sharp intake of breath.</p><p>“She cut his hair.”</p><p>Rio stopped breathing. Agatha began to cry.</p><p>The soft sounds of her tears and ragged breathing made Rio freeze, made her heart constrict and stop in her chest.</p><p>She took a second, closed her eyes. The little boy with the big brown eyes and the goofy grin. His long hair that constantly fell in his eyes. The hair that Agatha was always brushing back for him. The hair that he touched when he was nervous just like Rio did.</p><p>“Nicky.” Rio said his name plainly, reverently, unable to think of anything else she <em>could</em> say.</p><p>“She took him,” Agatha gasped out, clearly trying to get a handle on her reaction. “Jen didn’t know what to do. She… she took him to the nearest salon and had them…”</p><p>But she didn’t finish her sentence.</p><p>And Rio was no longer frozen. Rio was no longer locked on the image of Nicky. On the boy who had her name and her face.</p><p>She’d moved on to Agatha.</p><p>“I’m coming.”</p><p>“Rio. No.”</p><p>“Too late. Absolutely not. There’s no way.” Rio was rambling now, scrambling about the place to find her keys. The fury of a thousand suns burning her up. Burning her fear. Burning through her inability to tell Agatha <em>no</em> that morning; her desire to fix, to hold, to protect flaring in her chest. “That bitch. That <em>witch</em>. I’m coming.”</p><p>And she heard Agatha gulp in some air, her breathing now ragged, now urgent, now transforming into broken, shaking sobs.</p><p>Rio was blinded by her tears as searched in vein for her keys. She couldn’t think. Couldn’t breathe. And then…</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped out, a small squeak of a noise following her desperate plea. “I-… I need you.”</p><p>This made Rio stop. It made her clutch at her chest. It made the jagged branches of fear that had sprouted in her and now bore fruit perish - purged from her by Agatha’s entreaty.</p><p>“I’m coming,” Rio repeated, breathless as she rushed to find her keys. “Stay on the line. I’ll be there. I’ll-…”</p><p>She sourced them, discarded on a shelf by the door.</p><p>In her sweats and a worn-in black hoodie, one of those indestructible ones bought for $20 that lasted a lifetime, she left the house she’d called home for the week and threw herself into her car.</p><p>She cursed loudly as she tried to get the key in the ignition but her hands were shaking so violently it took three attempts.</p><p>“Rio.” Rio didn’t respond to her name, didn’t have the mental capacity to be able to think. Because all she could focus on was getting to Agatha, was soothing Agatha, was-…</p><p>“Por favor… por favor, ten mucho cuidado.” <em>Please, please be careful.</em></p><p>Rio shook her head, grunting a little as the car kicked into life. It made a noise that Rio knew meant her little hybrid was doing the work of connecting to her phone to host Agatha’s voice instead.</p><p>She dropped her phone from where it had been sandwiched between her ear and her shoulder and it landed apathetically in her lap.</p><p>She barely glanced at the dash as she drove off, not bothering to put in Agatha’s address, and only focused on getting out, going down hill until she hit the interstate, and putting her foot on the gas the whole way.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but Rio could still hear her catching her breath, calming herself as some whimpers escaped her in what she assumed to be her bedroom. Rio was biting down on her tongue so hard she thought she might rip it out and then…</p><p>“Necesito… cariño, necesito oír tu voz.” <em>I need… baby, I need to hear your voice.</em></p><p>Rio shook her head again, swallowing the bile that had been swirling in her throat as she gripped the wheel.</p><p>It took a second. It took three more gasping breaths from Agatha. And then she whispered: “No es tu culpa.” <em>It’s not your fault.</em></p><p>Agatha realised a soft cry and Rio was temporarily blinded by her own tears that she quickly wiped away, trying her hardest to look ahead, to not die before she could get to Agatha.</p><p>“Mi vida. No es tu culpa.” <em>It’s not your fault.</em></p><p>Agatha whimpered quietly and Rio heard her sniff. She wasn’t holding back anymore and Rio had to wipe at her eyes again.</p><p>“Ya voy. Ya voy. Te amo. Ya voy.” <em>I’m coming. I’m coming. I love you. I’m coming.</em></p><p>The soundtrack of Agatha’s tears spurred her on to push the car harder, make it go faster. It whined and groaned as Rio pushed it but she didn’t care. She had to trust it would carry her to Agatha. Rio knew she was being reckless, she knew if the roads weren’t as quiet as they were she’d be putting herself in a lot of danger but she couldn’t bring herself to care.</p><p>Because how could she not be speeding? How could she not be breaking every law to get to Agatha as quickly as she could?</p><p>Minutes past and Agatha’s breathing began to even out. She sniffed more frequently, clearly now trying to get a hold on herself. And Rio only stared ahead, only kept her foot down, only came up with ways in which she could kill Agatha’s mother.<br/>
“¿Por qué no llamaste antes?” <em>Why didn’t you call earlier?</em></p><p>She didn’t mean for it to come out as harshly as it did.</p><p>Agatha breathed out, long and slow and loud and Rio could only imagine how close she was pinning the phone to her ear, how cold she would be curled up all by herself.</p><p>“Sabía que vendrías. Pero no estaba preparada. Tenía que concentrarme en Nicky y contigo ahí... perdería el control.” <em>I knew you'd come. But I wasn't ready. I had to focus on Nicky and with you there... I'd lose it.</em></p><p>Rio felt her head nod, just once, as if her body was reserving its energy for something else. Something like holding Agatha so tight she’d walk around for the rest of her life knowing Rio was always somewhere waiting to hold her again.</p><p>“How…” Rio began, in English this time, her mind a jumble of questions and fears. “Is he okay?”</p><p>“I…,” Agatha followed her into another language, “He…” Agatha’s voice raised up an octave and Rio glanced at the screen. “Jen said he was crying in the chair. That she held his hand and he just cried.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her jaw set, her hands choking the wheel.</p><p>“Why did she do it?”</p><p>Agatha was silent, except for the slow breath she exhaled. “Punishment.”</p><p>“For Nicky?”</p><p>“For me.”</p><p>“Mi amor-…”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha said, a little firmer this time, “please concentrate on your driving. I don’t-…”</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Rio said in as soft a voice as she could manage. “Go back to Nicky.”</p><p>“Will you stay on the line?”</p><p>Rio’s muscles went slack, and she sank two inches where she’d been sitting ramrod straight, the weight of Agatha’s request forcing her to bear the unbearable.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>She heard Agatha move then, heard a door open, soft footsteps, then another door, and the sounds of Agatha climbing back into the bed.</p><p>Rio glanced at the screen but didn’t say anything and only wished she’d been more insistent that morning. Only wished Agatha had let her. Only wished she could be on the bed with her, holding her together, telling her over and over again that this wasn’t her fault, that only her mother was to blame.</p><p>But she was with Nicky now.</p><p>And Rio was on her way to them.</p><p>Agatha was curled with Nicky and Rio was five hours away driving to their side.</p><p>Rio kept her foot down, her ears straining to see if she could hear anything from either Agatha or Nicky.</p><p>But within an hour she could just about make out Agatha’s soft breathing and she knew she’d fallen asleep.</p><p>She relaxed a little, safe in the knowledge that Agatha was safe, no longer cognisant of what had happened. Of what had been done to her son.</p><p>Of whatever reason she had for thinking Evanora had done it to punish her.</p><p>In the space between getting to Agatha and being with Agatha, Rio was able to run it all through in her mind. The late night arrival of Evanora. Was that common? Did she just show up? The decision to take her grandson to have his hair chopped off. The image of her standing over his shoulder whilst Jen - as hardline and unfeeling as she could sometimes appear - held his hand as he cried.</p><p>And then there was Agatha, who’d prioritised her son that day. Who was even now protecting him as he slept. Who had initially refused Rio when she offered to come. Who’d refused her again that evening. Who had, on the third time that Rio had said she would come, changed her mind and asked her to instead.</p><p>The tree of fear that had died inside her now became little seedlings of hope. Germinating in the rich soils of Agatha’s request for her to come, with her desire to have Rio on the open line for her even as she slept.</p><p>And the little hybrid that could charged to its destination, its driver barely concentrating on the roads, thinking instead of the woman she should never have let go alone into the claws of her mother.</p><p>She arrived outside Agatha’s gate shortly after one in the morning. She assumed she’d have speeding tickets waiting for her in a week or so but she’d pay any fine necessary under the circumstances. She disconnected her phone from the car. She clutched it tightly in her hand after parking up.</p><p>She walked the few hundred yards to the front of Agatha’s house.</p><p>She hesitated, unsure how to buzz without breaking the spell of the peaceful, sleeping house.</p><p>But someone knew she was there without her even ringing to be let in.</p><p>The gate opened for her, and Rio pushed it until she was inside and could see a figure in the doorway.</p><p>Jen.</p><p>“I didn’t… I didn’t know what to do.”</p><p>Rio hung up from Agatha and moved quickly, and before she could understand what she was doing, she’d thrown her arms around Jennifer Kale and let her cry silently into her shoulder.</p><p>It took a while for Jen to speak but when she did it was soft, and she was hiccuping slightly.</p><p>“He was so upset.” She sniffed and shook her head against her. “But Evanora… she wouldn’t take no for an answer. She’s his <em>grandmother</em> and Agatha… Agatha was driving… I didn’t want to panic her or scare her or…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio breathed, staring blindly into the dark house ahead of her. “Nicky knows you wouldn’t-…”</p><p>“I <em>wouldn’t</em>. I know I… I love that kid.”</p><p>Rio nodded and she pulled away slowly, frowning up into Jen’s tortured expression.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have let her come alone.”</p><p>“She wouldn’t let me call you. She knew you’d come if you knew. She hasn’t cried or shouted or-…”</p><p>Rio sighed and closed her eyes and then something happened that she wasn’t expecting. Jen placed her hands softly against her cheeks. She held her head in place and Rio looked back at her, allowing herself to relax into it.</p><p>“I’m glad you came. Go and be with them. They’re in Agatha’s room.”</p><p>Rio smiled as Jen dropped her hold on her and she stepped around her into the warm house only to hesitate and turn back.</p><p>“Have you not slept?”</p><p>“I thought at some point I’d have to open the gate for you so…”</p><p>Rio moved back in, took Jen’s arm, kissed her cheek, “Go to sleep.”</p><p>She felt sorry for Jen, she really did. She appeared genuinely contrite, genuinely distraught. But she was also furious with her. Fuelled by the knowledge that under no circumstances, if Nicky had been left in her care, would Evanora have been able to lay a hand on him, or touch a hair on his head.</p><p>But then as she stared up into Jen’s eyes she registered something that Jen hadn’t said but that was abundantly clear. She was a black woman with no real claim on Nicky other than his mother’s word. And Evanora was a white bitch with bigotry in her heart and hatred in her veins.</p><p>There was nothing Jen could have done not without Evanora doing something heinous in return.</p><p>She smiled sadly, and in a whisper repeated the words she’d said to Agatha before: “It’s not your fault.” Jen only nodded, only motioned for Rio to go up.</p><p>The house was silent as she made her way to Agatha’s room.</p><p>The door was ajar and Rio cautiously looked into it, concerned any creak or sudden movement would wake the sleeping bodies in the bed.</p><p>But Agatha and Nicky slept on as she moved towards them.</p><p>Nicky was curled into his mama, his new haircut hidden under a beanie. And Rio smiled for it. Able to make out in the gloom the word ‘CELTICS’ around the base. It didn’t really match the Spiderman pyjamas that peeked out from where his body was hidden beneath the duvet but Rio thought he looked like the coolest and bravest little boy in the world.</p><p>And there there was Agatha.</p><p>She was in the clothes she’d left in this morning. Rio’s sweater still on, even as she was curled up below the sheets.</p><p>Even in sleep her brow looked a little furrowed and Rio moved instinctively to her side of the bed.</p><p>She climbed onto it and placed a hand cautiously on Agatha’s arm, moving so she was curled behind her, but with a few inches distance. Fearful Nicky would wake before his mom, Rio lay like this for a while, not touching Agatha nearly as much as she wanted to, but there all the same.</p><p>She fell asleep after what must have been over an hour of lying still, listening to Agatha’s soft breathing, her hand sliding down from Agatha’s arm to rest behind her on the bed when she did.</p><h4>Sunday</h4><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio woke with a frown, and instinctively raised her hand up to rub at her face but found a hand on her wrist stopped her from digging her knuckles into her eyes.</p><p>A small hand.</p><p>Nicky.</p><p>She looked up cautiously, blinking into the light of the morning and seeing Nicky, still in his hat that now sat a little crooked on his head, blinking back down at her.</p><p>“Hey, kid.”</p><p>He was leaning over Agatha and so Rio sat up slowly, pushing herself to lean on her arm against the bed so Nicky could relax back. She didn’t know what to say. But Nicky was speaking for her, clearly trying to keep his voice soft to avoid waking his mom.</p><p>“Did you hear what grandmother did?”</p><p>Rio nodded, watching as Nicky’s brow began to furrow and his big brown eyes began to fill with tears. She couldn’t stand it.</p><p>She moved quickly from the bed. The sleep gone from her limbs as she moved around to Nicky’s side and held out her hand. “Come here.”</p><p>Nicky obliged quickly, sensing the urgency in Rio’s voice, and trusting her enough to leave his sleeping mom alone in the bed. He took her hand and let her help him shuffle until his feet hit the floor. Now on solid ground they both looked to check on Agatha who lay still, and in looking at her properly, Rio saw her hand curled around her phone.</p><p>She wanted to stay with her.</p><p>But she had something else to do.</p><p>She took Nicky through to the en suite and closed the door behind them quietly.</p><p>Nicky wasn’t frowning anymore, instead toying with his fingers as he watched Rio with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>“What are we doing?”</p><p>Rio shushed him gently and began to search the drawers and the cupboards, finding, as she expected, that they were all arranged neatly, which made her mission easier.</p><p>When she found what she was looking for she turned to Nicky with a grin and held them up.</p><p>“We’re cutting my hair.”</p><p>Nicky’s mouth fell open and he stared up at Rio, his fidgeting fingers now frozen in place.</p><p>Rio’s delighted smile faded slowly into something softer and she sank to her knees before the little boy who had her face, but his mother’s fear.</p><p>“Hey, you know how we look a little the same?”</p><p>Nicky nodded slowly.</p><p>“Well I quite like looking a little the same as you. So if you wouldn’t mind…” She held out the small pair of scissors, gently handing them handle first. Nicky took them and frowned down at them.</p><p>Rio felt her heart this heavily in her chest, her instinct to protect Agatha’s son firing like never before.</p><p>“Hey,” she whispered gently, reaching to hold the hand that held the scissors. “Are you-…?”</p><p>Her words were lost as Nicky threw himself at her and Rio almost lost her balance for the force of him now hugging into her. She gasped and caught herself just before her head smacked against the counter. But she didn’t care. She’d take a hundred concussions if she could take away Nicky’s pain.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured quietly, swallowing down the lump in her throat when she placed a hand on his upper back and felt nothing but the fabric of his pyjamas where before there would have been the feel of his soft, long hair. Evanora would pay for what she’d done. “It’s okay to be sad.”</p><p>Nicky nodded against her, his face pressed firmly into her shoulder. Rio held him to her until Nicky began to pull away. His eyes were wide and his cheeks and nose were flushed and in him Rio saw Agatha and for a moment she was speechless before she whispered, “Can I see it?”</p><p>Nicky sniffled quietly, one hand fisting the fabric of Rio’s hoodie, the other that carried the scissors raising up to pull his hat from his head. Beneath it Nicky’s dark hair was trimmed close at the sides, where the tapered edges softly faded into tanned skin.</p><p>On top of his head, the hair was a little longer, and Rio could only imagine had initially been styled until Nicky had hidden it beneath his comforting, soft beanie hat. A wayward curve of hair rested against his forehead, defying the forced neatness of the cut that was now shaggy and messy from sleep and the hat, and Rio gently tucked it back and smiled when it remained defiant and fell back into the place she’d pushed it from.</p><p>Nicky was still as he waited for Rio’s verdict and Rio took a second to process the change, to choose her words carefully, to not diminish his feelings but to not let on to her own.</p><p>“Still very handsome.”</p><p>Nicky smiled a little and Rio smiled right back. “So, will you help us look a little the same again? Mellizos?” <em>Twins?</em></p><p>“Mellizos?” Nicky repeated quietly, and Rio felt him twisting the fabric of her hoodie.</p><p>“Twins.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and repeated quietly, “mellizos”, letting it roll around it his mouth, saying it again, making Rio smile at how seriously he was taking this new word.</p><p>“You got it. Now, I’ll show you where to cut, okay?”</p><p>Nicky looked up then, his eyes wider than before, his fingers unconsciously tugging at her hoodie.</p><p>“You want to?”</p><p>“Well, I’ve seen how handsome you look and I’d like to look that handsome too.”</p><p>“Girls can’t be handsome.”</p><p>Rio gasped dramatically, throwing her hand to her chest, “You think I’m not handsome?”</p><p>And Nicky grinned immediately, a dazzling, wide grin that lit up his whole face, and giggled with it. “Very handsome.” He tugged back and forth at her hoodie, holding fast to her still as he giggled.</p><p>“Good,” Rio nodded with finality, trying not to grin too much and keep up the faux-seriousness of the endeavour. She took away his hat and lay it on the counter behind her before she held her fingers up to a section of her hair and outlined it with them for Nicky.</p><p>“Here. Slowly, and gently, cut between my fingers, okay? Don’t worry about being neat. We can fix it later.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, his grin dissolving before Rio’s eyes. He looked serious again as he shuffled closer and released his hold on her. He held the scissors now with two hands. She held her breath as he opened them and held them to her hair.</p><p>But he stopped and Rio watched him as he stared at where he was about to make the cut. He looked nervous, his lower lip pulled between his teeth.</p><p>“You won’t be sad?”</p><p>“No, sweetheart. I won’t be sad.”</p><p>Nicky nodded again and stared for a little while longer at the place the small blades framed Rio’s hair. He sucked in a breath. Rio held hers again.</p><p>He closed the blades.</p><p>The sound of the cut made Rio want to cry. It wasn’t that she was particularly precious about her hair. She’d chopped it all off herself when she was fourteen which had resulted in an unfortunate pixie cut for a few weeks.</p><p>She had dyed it so she’d had a matching red streak in it with Alice when she was first in college.</p><p>And for roles she’d worn wigs, extensions, allowed hair stylists to do whatever they pleased with it.</p><p>But this felt like something other. Something more meaningful than any of those changes. More meaningful than anything she’d <em>ever</em> done.</p><p>With her encouragement, and gentle guidance, Nicky continued to cut until a good portion of her hair had fallen to the floor at their feet.</p><p>Nicky pulled back, looking horrified at what he’d done but Rio scooped the hair up and smiled as she held it out, forcing herself to believe the words she uttered. “It’ll grow back.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and touched the hair laid out in Rio’s hand and smiled at the feel of it. “Its longer than mine was.”</p><p>“Well, are you going to grow your hair again?”</p><p>“Mmhm. Mama said I could and no one will touch it.”</p><p>“Good. Your mama is very smart.”</p><p>“Very smart.”</p><p>“Well when we’ve finished cutting mine I’m going to start growing it immediately too.”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky said, a shy smile now working its way up his face as he reached to touch the strands now hanging just below Rio’s chin. “We can do it together? Mellizos?”</p><p>“I’d like that. And you know what helps hair to grow?”</p><p>“Vegetables.”</p><p>“No, ice cream and basketball.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and shook his head, his hand now back to holding the collar of Rio’s hoodie. “No it doesn’t!”</p><p>“It does!”</p><p>And Rio grinned as Nicky continued to laugh, pleased her sacrifice had been worth it. She smiled as she gently took the scissors from him and confidently cut across the other side of her hair, realising at the last second that she probably should have used the mirror.</p><p>Nicky scooped up the hair that fell down and grinned as he held it up for Rio’s inspection. “There’s so much!”</p><p>Rio laughed at this, momentarily overjoyed with the change to the little boy’s demeanour.</p><p>But the door behind them opened and suddenly she wasn’t so sure anymore.</p><p>Agatha stood there, staring at them both with wide eyes and an unreadable expression.</p><p>Nicky turned with a gasp and beamed at his mother, holding up Rio’s hair like a tithe to a king. And Agatha stared down at it. Rio couldn’t get a read on her, couldn’t figure out what she was thinking.</p><p>She held the small scissors up and Agatha’s eyes darted over to them. “We need some help with the back.”</p><p>She threw what remained of her long hair over her shoulder and smiled hopefully, but secretly held her breath as she waited for Agatha to say something.</p><p>She did. Ten seconds after Rio had last spoken.</p><p>“Mama?”</p><p>“You cut your hair?”</p><p>It was an obvious question, and there was clearly an obvious answer.</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to give it when Nicky did it for her. “I did, mama.”</p><p>“We both did.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her son and then looked to Rio, and Rio caught on to how Agatha was feeling suddenly. She scrambled to her feet and tapped at Nicky’s shoulders, “Hey, I’ll get your mama to help with this and you can go wake Jen and get her to make us pancakes, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and turned to deliver the hair back into Rio’s hand, smiling at her proudly before he slipped past Agatha and ran off to find Jen.</p><p>Rio only looked up again when she heard the bedroom door close and she shrugged a little, one hand holding the scissors, the other a fistful of her chopped hair.</p><p>“I didn’t really think I just… wanted him to not feel so alone.”</p><p>Agatha closed the distance between them and Rio briefly worried she’d read it wrong and that she was mad but her hands were on her face now, her blue eyes shining with the unshed tears she’d spotted a moment ago. And her heart sank, because mad was always much better than sad.</p><p>“You’re such an idiot.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little even as she frowned and she bit down on her lip as Agatha continued to stare at her, continued to fight against her own tears. Rio let her sit in it for only a few seconds before she spoke again: “I should have come with you. I should have-…”</p><p>Agatha had kissed her. Agatha <em>was</em> kissing her.</p><p>And Rio kissed her back.</p><p>The scissors fell into the sink behind her and her hand released the evidence of her fury at Evanora.</p><p>But Agatha kissed her through all of that. She kissed her until neither of them could breathe and when she pulled away she continued to nudge their lips together, continued to hold Rio’s face.</p><p>“You did it again,” Agatha eventually whispered, so low and so soft that Rio - so tired and so angry and so focused on Agatha’s lip against her own - almost didn’t register it.</p><p>“Did what?”</p><p>“You’re being too sweet too…”</p><p>“Let me be here for you. Let me be here for Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head but it wasn’t a refusal. She kissed her again, and then again, and then Rio felt the tears against her cheek that Agatha had been holding in for so long. She tugged Agatha closer into her, fisted the fabric of her stolen sweater, buried her face into her neck, and let Agatha cry.</p><p>By the time Agatha was done, felt brave enough to pull back, Rio had decided something: that she’d always be there if Evanora were to come calling. That she’d standing behind Agatha and in front of Nicky.</p><p>She raised her sleeve up to gently wipe at Agatha’s face, drying her tears for her as Agatha smiled a little, sniffing shakily. “We’re in a bathroom, you know. There are tissues.”</p><p>“What else are my sleeves for?”</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly and nudged Rio’s hand away to press her face closer again, her hands moving around to bury in the mess that had been made of her hair.</p><p>“Let me try and fix it. Alice will kill you.”</p><p>Rio smiled and pulled back to turn over her shoulder and glance at herself in the mirror. “Holy shit it is bad.”</p><p>Gentle hands began to turn her around and far from picking up the scissors to actually help Agatha instead snaked her arms around her and pressed against her again, nuzzling into the neck she now had free access to where her hair stopped just by her jaw.</p><p>“I can’t believe you let my seven year old son cut your hair.”</p><p>“He was upset.”</p><p>Agatha sighed heavily and Rio shivered for the breath travelling down her neck. “Did she apologise?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio moved her jaw, poking her tongue into her cheek, watching Agatha nuzzle closer through the mirror. She took a slow breath in and squeezed over the hands that had hidden themselves in the front pocket of her hoodie.</p><p>“Why did she do it?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled again, slow, soft. And through the mirror she now locked eyes with Rio, her sea blue irises shiny through the tears. “She’s always hated his hair. Always said it was too girly, not becoming of a ‘young gentleman’. But I’ve never left her alone with him, never let her… it’s always just been words, pointed comments. And Ralph always agreed. But never cared enough to do anything so I… I never thought she’d do it.”</p><p>Rio nodded quietly and lifted her hand back to hold Agatha’s head, “You couldn’t have prevented it.” Though her words were hypocritical. Because she believed <em>she</em> could have and so she understood some of Agatha’s guilt but she couldn’t let her sit in it. At least not alone.</p><p>“If I’d been here, Rio… If I…” but she stopped herself, sighed heavily and placed a kiss to Rio’s shoulder. Rio closed her eyes and took in a deep breath, letting Agatha kiss along to her neck, against her jaw, to her cheek. “Let me fix your hair.”</p><p>Rio nodded and opened her eyes again, feeling the loss of Agatha already as she pulled back and with gentle fingers brushed through Rio’s hair.</p><p>It never felt intimate, getting her hair cut, but then Rio had never had her hair cut by someone she loved before. And Agatha was silent as she worked, gently brushing through her hair with every trim of the tiny scissors. She watched her through the mirror as she turned her head this way and that to judge length, to adjust where needed and leave what was already too far gone.</p><p>By the time Agatha was finished Rio Vidal stared back at herself in the mirror, her dark hair smoothed down by gentle hands, the majority of it straighter than it had been, skimming the line of her jaw.</p><p>It had looked better. But it could definitely look worse.</p><p>But Agatha was taking advantage again of the easy access to Rio’s skin now and had turned her from her own reflection to nudge her chin up and kiss along the column of her throat.</p><p>Rio grinned at her eagerness, her eyes closed as she released a soft chuckle and Agatha captured the vibrations on her lips.</p><p>She pulled away just as Rio was beginning to worry she wouldn’t stop and she wouldn’t have the self-control to make her. And when she looked at Agatha again she looked calm, calmer than she had been before, almost as calm as she had been the previous night.</p><p>“Thank you. For coming, for being so good with Nicky, for… <em>thank you</em>.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she lifted her hands to cradle Agatha’s face, “Mi corazón estaba aquí. ¿Cómo no iba a venir?” <em>My heart was here. How could I not come?</em></p><p>Agatha turned her head into Rio’s palm and kissed her there. Closing her eyes she remained still until she eventually whispered, “Will you stay today? Stay the night? We can take Nicky to school in the morning and drive back up together. Have our last night just us.”</p><p>Rio nodded and watched as Agatha turned to her again, and found that she had grabbed the fabric of her hoodie in the exact spot her son had. She melted into her and closed the distance to kiss her.</p><p>“I’d like that. I did, however, tell Nicky the best way to make hair grow was ice cream and basketball.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and the sound was like manna to her ears. “So I think that might be most of my day accounted for.”</p><p>“I’ll allow it.”</p><p>“Oh you will?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio grinned as she delicately kissed her cheek. “We need to talk about you stealing my clothes, by the way.”</p><p>She slipped from her place at the counter and briefly tugged at the sweater Agatha wore.</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio paused halfway out the door. “Then why is your suitcase still unopened and I have no clean clothes left?”</p><p>Agatha lunged for her side and Rio yelped as she hurried back into the bedroom only to be tackled as she reached the next door and pressed, laughing and squirming, into it. Agatha’s hands were flying over her torso, tickling and teasing as Rio tried to push her away, tried to free herself from the torment.</p><p>It lasted until Agatha stopped, until they were both breathless and beaming. Until Agatha’s teasing turned to earnestness and she whispered: “I like to feel close.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faded to nothing and she arched her back as Agatha wrapped around her and Rio secured her arms around her neck. “Then take whatever you want.”</p><p>Agatha’s cautious blue eyes flashed up from where they’d been focused in around Rio’s nose and Rio smiled at the sight. She felt her racing heart slow to a softer rhythm, unbeknownst to her now in tandem with Agatha’s, both beating for the other, forever now moored together by something beyond comprehension and above this mortal plane.</p><p>“This hoodie looks nice,” Agatha said after a few moments silence between them, now tugging at the strings. Rio laughed and rolled her eyes, pushing Agatha backwards with her body but keeping her arms around her.</p><p>“It’s got your tears and snot all over it.”</p><p>“Then maybe I’ll let you keep it. I’m sure you’ll treasure it.”</p><p>Rio hummed as she kissed Agatha one last time before pulling away. “Come on. Pancakes.”</p><p>As they left together Agatha entwined their fingers, stealing Rio’s right hand to mix with her left. And the walk through the quiet house this time couldn’t have been more different. When she’d rocked up that morning she’d been boiling over with fury, and now the anger was simply simmering, cooled down by Agatha’s presence and Nicky’s smiles.</p><p>When they arrived in the kitchen Agatha squeezed her hand before dropping it and made a beeline for her son, who was swinging his legs from the stool at the kitchen island. Rio laughed as Nicky yelped and giggled as he received the penance for being apart from his mom for more than five minutes: many, many kisses.</p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>She’d almost forgotten the haircut.</p><p>Rio looked around and smiled in amusement at Jen’s shocked expression. “What the fuck-?!”</p><p>“Jen.” Agatha chastised as she moved away from Nicky and hurried to the pan to try and salvage whatever batter monstrosity Jen was currently burning. “Language.”</p><p>“Oh no this deserves <em>language</em>, Agatha. Have you seen her fucking hair?”</p><p>Rio scoffed as she took the stool beside Nicky. “Nicky says I look handsome.”</p><p>“Yes,” Nicky agreed, but his cheeks were pink and as Rio turned to him he looked shy. “Mirellos.”</p><p>“Mellizos,” Rio corrected as she nudged his shoulder gently. “We’re growing our hair out together.” Nicky nodded and looked serious as he whispered the word again to commit it to memory. <em>“Mellizos. Mellizos. Mellizos.”</em></p><p>“Okaaaaaay, have you told Alice? You’re back to set on Wednesday.”</p><p>“Leave her alone, Jen.”</p><p>Rio smiled and slid back off the stool to go and pour two mugs of coffee, narrowly avoiding Jen’s outstretched hand as she went to touch her hair. “Hey. Leave it. No touching.”</p><p>She huffed. “You should call Alice.”</p><p>“I’ll call her later.”</p><p>She grabbed the coffee pot and felt a hand on her head at the same time she heard a small voice suddenly become a large one: “Hey! Don’t touch my mellizos!”</p><p>Rio almost dropped the pot in surprise and the kitchen stopped as three pairs of eyes turned to look at the little boy now standing on the highest footrest of his stool, his hands placed on the island as he frowned at the person who had touched his melliza.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha cooed gently, moving the pan off the heat as she turned properly to Nicky. “She’s okay, baby.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and replaced the pot on the heating pad to move around Jen and sink back into her stool beside Nicky. He’d sat back now and was so red the tips of his ears were aflame, his doe eyes still wide and now teary as he looked to Agatha.</p><p>And Agatha pulled him into a tight hug as Rio reached to rub his back.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio.” Jen looked mortified, thunderstruck as she watched Nicky bury his face against Agatha. “And Nicky I’m sorry too. If you ask someone not to touch you… they shouldn’t touch you.”</p><p>Jen turned away then to hide the tears forming in her eyes and she finished what Rio had started and poured two mugs of coffee. Rio kept her eyes on Nicky and caught Agatha’s gaze over his shoulder and smiled sadly at her, catching the soft furrow in her brow.</p><p>“Here,” Jen said quietly as she placed the mug before her. As she pulled away Rio reached up to catch her wrist and held her in place, “Hey, will you call Alice? I should show her and… I think you need her today.”</p><p>Jen understood the peace offering and smiled as she slid Agatha’s mug across the counter as the mother and son duo broke apart. Nicky was still a little flushed and was staring at the counter but Rio reached to punch his shoulder and whispered, “Gracias, mellizo.”</p><p>She caught his eye then and Nicky smiled his little shy smile and the kitchen seemed to relax around them again. Jen began to make pains to gain some points and even offered to play basketball after breakfast.</p><p>Rio could only watch and smile as she ate the blueberry pancakes that were apparently Agatha’s specialty and Nicky’s favourites.</p><p>By the time she was on her forth - blind rage and driving through the night awakens an insatiable hunger in a person - Alice had arrived to the tune of: “Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio bundled her into a room to explain the situation and after a <em>lot</em> of language that Agatha wouldn’t have appreciated around her son, they eventually came back to the kitchen. Agatha and Jen had been talking quietly by the stove and Nicky had rushed off to find his jacket and sneakers.</p><p>“Everything okay?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and turned to pick up her mug. “Fine. Alice? Language under control?”</p><p>“I mean, fucking hell, I guess so.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but relaxed slightly as Rio moved over to kiss her cheek, careful not to linger incase Nicky appeared again.</p><p>“Mellizos?”</p><p>“Cute, no?”</p><p>“What does it mean?”</p><p>Three voices together answered Jen’s question: “Twins.”</p><p>“Oh you are so corny, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and ran her hand through her new hair as Agatha raised her hand to do the same and an excited little boy appeared in the room. “Mama!”</p><p>Agatha could hear the accusation in Nicky’s voice so turned to him with a smile, “It’s okay, baby. Rio said I could.”</p><p>Nicky relaxed his shoulders and nodded, looking to Rio for a second and waiting for her to confirm with a nod before he held up a basketball. “Can we play?”</p><p>“Sure, kid. Jen? Let’s go.”</p><p>Alice snorted only to be met with a scowl from Jennifer which made her shut up immediately. “Oh. You’re serious?”</p><p>“Oh yes.” Rio grinned as she dragged Jen out to the little basketball court outside, allowing Nicky to dictate how the game would go. It didn’t take long for everyone, including the watchful Agatha and Alice who had joined them, to decide that perhaps it was best that Jen sat out.</p><p>Nicky tottered over to her when she announced she was done as Rio went to fish the ball from the pool she’d managed to toss it into. He held out his hand to her, shyly wished her a “good game”, and within minutes was being run ragged by Rio and her expert drills and layups.</p><p>“Twins,” Jen muttered to Agatha as the three on the sidelines huddled together for warmth, Agatha a little ways away from the girlfriends pressed close. Alice had offered her her arm but Agatha had muttered something about, “Not being a touchy person.”</p><p>“It’s still weird,” Alice said softly, “She could easily be his mom.”</p><p>“Couple signatures and a court appearance and-…”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha whispered, tearing her eyes away from where Rio was teaching Nicky how to bounce the ball between his legs. “Stop it, Jen.”</p><p>But Alice was still stuck on the fact that her best friend had clearly had a secret baby, though she still couldn’t figure out when in their lives she’d been apart from her for nine months. “It’s like you took Rio, sprinkled a little of you, then added in more Rio and then-…”</p><p>“Can we stop?”</p><p>“It <em>is</em> crazy, Agatha. And… pretty romantic that she chopped all her hair off for him.”</p><p>Agatha blushed faintly, avoiding Jen’s knowing gaze and looked back over just as Nicky was charging towards her to celebrate his freshly learnt skill. Rio watched from the centre of the court, the basketball tucked under her arm, her nose and cheeks pink from the chill and exertion.</p><p>She watched as Agatha dropped down to hug her son, saw her whisper in his ear, and the turn as he pelted back to her and she was bestowed with a hug so tight she couldn’t breathe. She dropped the ball and hugged him back, and was about to let go when another pair of arms encircled them and a cool nose pressed into her cheek.</p><p>“You’re frozen.”</p><p>“Says you.”</p><p>“Mama, you are squashing me.”</p><p>Rio barked a laugh as Agatha pulled back and Nicky smiled up at her, still clinging to Rio but reaching for Agatha too.</p><p>“Okay. Inside. Warm showers. Then popcorn and a movie. It’s too cold for basketball.”</p><p>“It’s never too cold for basketball,” Rio grumbled as she happily followed Nicky back into the house, stealing Alice’s mug of half-drunk coffee as she went.</p><p>Rio was the last down from her shower. Mostly because Agatha had snuck into the bathroom she’d commandeered and had decided a good thing to do was to warm Rio up by making out with her up against the glass partition before she could even get <em>into</em> the shower.</p><p>But she thankfully didn’t push her luck. She left Rio suddenly hot and bothered and a welcoming warm shower now turned into a necessary cold one.</p><p>Agatha had left Rio some clothes outside the door just as she had the first time Rio had stayed over and Rio changed into them and breathed Agatha in through the collar of her sweater.</p><p>Perhaps sharing clothes wasn’t the worst idea.</p><p>Rio ventured down, last to arrive to the gathering of people in the den. Alice and Jen were curled up on one side of the large couch and Nicky was curled with his mom. Which left Rio to sit in between alone.</p><p>That was until a small hand reached out to take her own and Rio turned to see Nicky watching her cautiously, unsure what her reaction would be. And Agatha beyond him, eyes on the screen, remote in her hand, was smiling at what had just happened - Nicky having asked before Rio had arrived if Agatha thought Rio might hold his hand.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen stole Rio’s attention and threw her over a blanket. Rio caught it before it smacked her in the face and covered her lap with it as she relaxed back, already feeling the pang of being so close to Agatha and unable to touch her.</p><p>Nicky’s hold helped though.</p><p>Agatha settled on <em>Jurassic Park</em> without asking for anyone’s opinions on the matter. Something somewhere was pressed and the lights were dimmed and before Isla Nublar was even introduced on screen Rio’s head lolled to the side and she fell asleep.</p><p>She woke about an hour or so later, surprisingly warm, surprisingly without a sharp pain in her neck. A hand was by her jaw, the warmth of it tickling her skin but not touching her as deft fingers toyed with the edges of her chopped hair.</p><p>Agatha had moved over whilst Rio had been asleep. She’d somehow moved her so her head could be against her shoulder, so they could share the blanket, so she could keep Rio warm and comfortable as she slept.</p><p>As Rio shifted, Agatha’s light touch moved to her cheek, and Rio smiled as she moved a hand across to Agatha’s thigh and squeezed it gently, thanking her for moving.</p><p>She opened her eyes and she sat up more and looked over to see Jen similarly curled into Alice , similarly fast asleep. To Agatha’s right now Nicky sat under her arm, staring straight ahead and completely absorbed in the movie.</p><p>And beside her Agatha turned to look at her and whispered close to her ear, “You’re so warm.”</p><p>Rio smiled and rubbed at her eyes as she settled back into the couch more, now stretching her legs out in front of her. “It’s warm in here.”</p><p>She closed her eyes again and soon found that Agatha was moving beside her, stretching her own legs out to press beside Rio’s and the hand that had once toyed with her hair was now below the blanket, holding Rio’s as it held her thigh.</p><p>Rio fell asleep not long after that. Then Alice did. Then Agatha. Until finally Nicky was the last one standing, too enraptured in his raptors to do a silly thing like fall asleep.</p><p>But the movie ended and sleep won in the end too. He curled more into his mom who in her sleep curled more into him. And Rio, feeling the tug of Agatha even in her subconscious, pressed in behind her.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and pressed in where it was warm and soft and smelt nice.</p><p>But Alice’s voice was closer now, a hand on her side more insistent. “Babe. Wake up. You won’t sleep tonight. It’s still early.”</p><p>Rio huffed a heavy breath against Agatha’s neck that caused her to stir too and in moving she dislodged Rio and made her roll over to shoot daggers at Alice who simply smiled at her and made to touch her hair.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Nicholas River Harkness, his namesake’s biggest defender, suddenly reached a hand to slap Alice away. Alice blinked, having not been privy to the earlier conversation, but dropped her hand as Rio grinned crookedly up at her.</p><p>“Thank you, Nicky.”</p><p>“You gotta sort that hair. Like immediately. You look insane.”</p><p>A huff beside her told her that Agatha was awake now and was turning over to throw her arms around Rio, leaning up onto her elbow to scowl at Alice. “Would you just back <em>off</em>.”</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha. She’s shooting in like two days.”</p><p>“Three,” Rio corrected with a yawn.</p><p>“Whatever. It’s important it’s fixed.”</p><p>“Someone will do it on Wednesday. I happen to think Nicky did a good job.”</p><p>Alice scoffed and Rio cracked an eye open and shot a grin in Nicky’s direction as he leant around his mom to get a look at her. Her smile widened and below the blanket she felt a warm hand slide up to her side.</p><p>She knew it was going to happen before it did.</p><p>She yelped and barked a laugh as practised fingers pressed in the soft spot between her ribs and her hip. And then something happened that Rio hadn’t experienced since she was a teenager with her cousins.</p><p>A pile on. A three person heap. Agatha was attacking her sides and Nicky was joining the fray because he was his mother’s son and Rio’s biggest fan.</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes but smiled as she moved away and Jen in the corner woke groggily to the sounds of squeals and shouts and huffed as she pulled the blanket over her head.</p><p>But Agatha let up so Rio could breathe. And she lay half on her, her grinning face against her cheek. Nicky clambered over and dropped his head to Rio’s other shoulder and Rio had never felt warmer or more love. She wrapped her arms around her love and her twin and sighed happily, turning to kiss one then the other.</p><p>Somewhere at the edge of the room she heard Alice muscle Jen to get up and leave them and Rio had never been more grateful to her friend.</p><p>She could hear Nicky’s soft breaths, feel Agatha’s gentle fingers lightly brushing over her hip, and she wondered if this is what having your own family felt like. One you chose, rather than were born into.</p><p>Rio had been lucky with the former, Alice was like a sister to her and as such was a good example of the latter, but <em>this</em>, Agatha and her son curled around her, was different.</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha uttered quietly after a few minutes of them all absorbed in each other, “do you have everything for school?”</p><p>“Yes, Mama.”</p><p>“Okay, baby.” Agatha pushed up slowly and brushed her son’s cheek, her fingers reaching instinctually for the hair that wasn’t there anymore.  “Go ask Jen and she’ll make you a snack, okay? Some fruit too though, please.”</p><p>Rio felt Nicky nod against her shoulder and then he pushed up and hurried from the room. Agatha’s hand moved from Rio’s hip to her sternum as she turned back to her with a soft smile, “What were you saying the other day about quick triggers?”</p><p>“Being ticklish and,” Rio glanced to make sure no one was around, “coming quickly are <em>not</em> the same things.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as she leant in to kiss her and withdrew her hand from below her sweater to run through her hair, using the motion to then run her fingers along her jaw. “Alice is right. It does look awful.”</p><p>“Thank you. That’s so kind of you to say.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and Rio continued to smile, grunting a little when Agatha moved to lay over her fully. She sighed as Agatha began to trace the line of her jaw again and in a softer voice than before she said: “Why do you think your mom was punishing you?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted and closed and Rio for a second could almost see the walls building up again. “I don’t want to talk about my mother.”</p><p>Rio gasped when Agatha ducked down to press a soft kiss to her throat, nuzzling in for a second before nipping teasingly at her and making Rio laugh. “Mi amor. We can’t. Don’t tease me.”</p><p>Agatha huffed quietly and flopped down properly over Rio, making her grunt again as she held her tight. “You’re still okay to stay tonight?”</p><p>“Of course I am.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded and tugged Agatha’s sweater up to feel her skin.</p><p>“I still can’t believe you did it.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Your hair.”</p><p>Agatha lifted up again to look down at her and moved her hand to tug at a strand of her freshly trimmed hair. “It’s incredibly sexy.”</p><p>“Didn’t you just say it was awful?”</p><p>Agatha grinned, “That too. But sleep in my room tonight?”</p><p>“Oh I thought there were rules about that in this house.”</p><p>“No more rules. Only you, under me, okay?”</p><p>Rio huffed playfully, “I suppose if I-…” but Agatha was nipping at her jaw, her hand snaking its way up to her breast when:</p><p>“Holy shit!”</p><p>Agatha practically jumped off of her and Rio scrambled to sit up, bright red as she saw Alice closing the door quickly behind her. “You’re like teenagers. Rio, Nicky wants to know if you would like the berries <em>on</em> your ice cream or <em>beside</em> your ice cream. I told him I’d best come check so he can protect his ice cream from Jen. Thank god I did.”</p><p>Rio laughed and rubbed the back of her neck as Agatha huffed, “That’s hardly the healthy snack I was going for.”</p><p>“Berries are healthy,” Alice shrugged, now clear of any fondling she opened the door for them. Rio smiled at her friend and made to follow Agatha out but Alice had stopped her, was reaching for her hair as Rio batted her lightly away.</p><p>“Can I call someone? Get them to stop by?”</p><p>“No, Alice. I want Nicky to know that-…”</p><p>Alice sighed and glanced to make sure they were alone before she said in a lower voice, “Have you discussed what happens after Tuesday?”</p><p>“No. I mean, no. Not really.”</p><p>“Is she leaving him?”</p><p>“Alice, I said no. I don’t know.”</p><p>“Are you not asking because you’re frightened of the answer or are you not asking because it’s easier to just live with the excitement of it all?”</p><p>“You think this is exciting for me?”</p><p>“No. I didn’t mean it like that. I just meant-…” but Alice sighed, stepped in and took Rio’s hand, “Look, Jen thinks she’s making moves in the background but is frightened to say anything in case-…”</p><p>“Hey,” Jen appeared in the room that led to the den and raised her brows at the two conspiring friends, “Everything okay? We have some melting ice cream for you, Rio. You should be honoured. I’ve looked after him all week and he didn’t ask for <em>me</em> to have a bowl. Just you.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little in Jen’s direction, saw her faux-cheeriness disappear briefly as she caught her eye but chose not to pry. This was a conversation she wanted to have with Agatha. And only Agatha.</p><p>“I’m coming.”</p><p>She took Alice by the arm and pulled her with her into the kitchen and saw that Nicky was jealously holding a bowl of ice cream under his arm whilst he ate from another. Agatha was dipping a spoon into the guarded bowl. Apparently there were exceptions to Nicky’s protection.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re eating my ice cream.”</p><p>“You snooze you lose.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and Agatha scoffed, now brandishing her spoon at Rio. “It’s <em>my</em> ice cream. I bought it.”</p><p>“I believe Nicky got it for <em>me</em>. Isn’t that right, kid?”</p><p>Nicky raised his brows and looked between Rio and Agatha and deliberated for a second before he said, “Maybe you can share. Mama likes pecan anyway.”</p><p>With a laugh Rio stole Agatha’s spoon and took the bowl that Nicky pulled back from, only to be grabbed back by Agatha. “Hey. Sharing.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Jen muttered as she eyed the two of them, Rio now squished between Nicky and Agatha at the counter, all three looking smug in their own way.</p><p>“How’re the lines coming along?” Alice asked pointedly, her dark gaze on the dark strands of Rio’s choppy hair cut. “All memorised?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“You’re a bad liar, Rio.”</p><p>“I’m a good actress, though. We’ll learn them tomorrow.”</p><p>“We?” Alice quoted back, glancing briefly at Agatha who was looking at Jen.</p><p>“Agatha said she’d-,” but an elbow to the ribs made her shut up as she passed the spoon to Agatha.</p><p>They weren’t supposed to be away together. Nicky didn’t know.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “Agatha said I could call her and we can run through them.”</p><p>Alice was still looking between Agatha and Jen, suspicious of what had just passed silently between them. Rio didn’t notice though, too intent on eating her ice cream, focused on the hand now holding her hip, on the brush of Agatha’s thumb against her skin.</p><p>After that the day went by slowly, like all good days should but rarely do.</p><p>Rio focused her attention on Nicky and Alice helped out where she could, being as big a basketball fan as both the other two were. They watched YouTube videos of old games, and both Rio and Alice took their turn teaching him techniques on the court that neither of them had really mastered but were enthusiastic about anyway.</p><p>They were occasionally called in by Agatha to make sure they were warm enough, that they’d had enough water and food, that Alice wasn’t freaking Nicky out by staring at her friend’s face reflected almost exactly on the little boy.</p><p>And during this time Agatha and Jen mostly stayed inside, doing what, or speaking about what, Rio could only guess.</p><p>All that mattered was that Nicky was now laughing more than he was frowning. That he joined Rio in calling Alice “pequeña Alice” and that the last thing on his mind was the loss of his hair.</p><p>Though Alice had playfully grabbed Rio after what she’d considered to be an illegal move on the court and Nicky and charged at her to ensure Rio’s hair wasn’t touched. Alice had quickly backed off and Rio had dropped down to pinky promise with Nicky that she was okay but how pleased she was that he was was looking out for her.</p><p>Nicky’s smile didn’t leave his face after that.</p><p>By the time dinner was served - early, so Nicky could eat with them and go to bed at a reasonable hour - Rio was on her last legs. Which is why Agatha’s hand on her thigh below the table was incredibly welcome.</p><p>Alice had decided to stay the night to be there when Nicky was home from school on Monday so they could play more ball and Agatha had even thanked her for it, suddenly a little more warm with Alice when she saw that Nicky was warmer with her too.</p><p>After dinner Rio and Alice did the dishes whilst Agatha helped Nicky with the things he’d need for school and Jen hovered nearby drinking red wine.</p><p>“So,” she said abruptly, clearly not very interested in the current topic of conversation - how short was too short for Rio’s hair.</p><p>“She told you about his name?”</p><p>Rio dropped the cutlery she was holding with a clatter.</p><p>“Whose name?”</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio said with a faint blush, casting her gaze over to Jen before she looked round at Alice. “His middle name is River.”</p><p>“That’s,” Alice began with a frown, now also looking to Jen, “a weird coincidence.”</p><p>“Apparently Agatha is a <em>hopeless</em> romantic, or maybe just a fucking loser.”</p><p>“<em>Hey</em>,” Rio snapped even as she blushed a little deeper and turned away from Jen just as Agatha arrived back in the room and Alice was still staring at her girlfriend with deep confusion across her face. “Agatha, did you name Nicky after Rio?”</p><p>Rio had her back to the room as she continued to load the dishwasher so didn’t get to experience the shock on Agatha’s face. But she heard the softness of her voice.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“But he’s what? Seven? That doesn’t make any sense.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and was straightening up from where she had put the last of the dishes away when she heard the padding of soft footsteps and Nicky had entered room again. “All clean,” he announced quietly to Agatha, showing off his freshly brushed teeth.</p><p>“Good boy. Now say goodnight. And I’ll come and read with you in a sec.”</p><p>Nicky did as he was told and gave everybody quick hugs but Rio couldn’t help but feel he’d made theirs just that little bit longer. “Buenas noches, mi mellizo.”</p><p>“Buenas noches, mellizo.”</p><p>She smiled as she let him rush back, shot her a grin over his shoulder, and left the room.</p><p>“Again with the favouritism!”</p><p>Rio laughed and snatched up her wine from the side, comfortable enough now in Agatha’s home to jump onto the counter and swing her legs. “Learn to shoot a three-pointer and he might like you better.”</p><p>“I’ve kept him alive for a week. That’s worth more than being able to play a game.”</p><p>Alice gasped as Agatha moved to stand back between Rio’s legs. “It’s not a game, baby. It’s a lifestyle.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes as Alice kissed her cheek and rubbed her back. “You’re <em>my</em> favourite, if that counts.” As Jen grumbled Rio draped her arm around Agatha and kissed her temple.</p><p>“You’re <em>my</em> favourite. Nicky a close second.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and turned her head to press into Rio’s cheek as she raised up from having kissed her shoulder. “Sap.”</p><p>“So, Agatha? The name?”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly as she turned from Rio to look at Alice. “What about it?”</p><p>“It’s Rio’s name?”</p><p>“Yes, I said that.”</p><p>“But-…”</p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha’s shoulder as she leant up, “Let her go and tuck Nicky in and we can talk about it, Alice.”</p><p>But before Agatha could pull away, Rio had made her turn her head and given her the kiss necessary before either of them left the room. Just because she could now. Just because she hoped their vacation habit would become a real life ritual.</p><p>Agatha smiled knowingly as she disappeared from the room.</p><p>“You,” Rio said pointedly, motioning to Alice with her red wine, “don’t tease her about this. She’s had a bad couple days.”</p><p>Alice made a noise of protest. “Who said I was teasing?!”</p><p>“I know you, Alice Gulliver-Wu. Be nice.”</p><p>Alice huffed and Rio was grateful when she heard Jen mumble to her, “She’s right. Go easy on the teasing later, okay?”</p><p>They all moved through to the more formal living room where Alice started a small fire in the hearth and Rio curled up in an armchair only to be told by Jen that was where Ralph usually sat. She grimaced and moved to the couch.</p><p>Agatha arrived after another ten minutes and went to sit back behind Rio. It wasn’t even a question that this would happen, more a reflex at this point. And Rio had simply sat forwards when Agatha moved towards her to allow it to happen.</p><p>“So,” Alice began before anyone else could determine the topic. “River?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and felt a hand sneak in beneath her sweater to touch her warm stomach.</p><p>“How did you know Rio seven years ago? She’d barely started out.”</p><p>“Chicago,” Agatha said simply, briefly leaning away to pick up the wine that had been left for her on the coffee table. “The improv show.”</p><p>Alice frowned and Agatha raised her brows as Rio turned her head. “I never told her.”</p><p>“Told me what?”</p><p>“Agatha met Rio at your little show,” Jen said gently, her gaze flitting between Agatha’s surprised face and Alice’s one. “They had a moment, apparently. I was only told about it a couple weeks ago.”</p><p>“A moment?”</p><p>Agatha shifted against Rio so Rio answered for her, “I was drunk. I flirted. We almost kissed but we were interrupted and… that’s that.”</p><p>The cogs were turning in Alice’s brain, more oil than machine. But she was getting there. “So you flirted in a bathroom and then… named your son after Rio?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>Agatha moved her hand more to tighten her hold on Rio and took advantage of her neck now being permanently exposed. She pressed her nose into her skin and Rio’s eyes fluttered at the tenderness.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>“Romantic as hell?”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and Jen smiled at the two of them, “Who knew you had it in you, Harkness?”</p><p>“I won’t be disparaged.”</p><p>Rio grinned and brushed her hand up to hold Agatha’s thigh and felt Agatha’s hand move to above where her heart would be. “It is romantic, mi corazon. Considering he’s here because of me anyway…”</p><p>Agatha made a quiet noise and nipped at her ear. Rio moved her hand to where Agatha’s was, and held it over her sweater. “That was a private conversation.”</p><p>“Está bien, mi amor.”</p><p>Alice was staring at the two of them now, ignoring Jen as she tried to get her to turn away, tried to get her to look round at her. But she was suddenly fascinated by the show. Rio’s head was turned as best it could be to Agatha. Agatha was holding Rio as if afraid someone would take her, brazenly resting her hand still below her sweater. They were both smiling a little, both looked lost in the other, both so in love. “Is this what you’re like when you’re alone? <em>Agatha</em> how are you still married to a man?”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha stiffen and saw Jen’s eyes bug as she finally got Alice’s attention. Alice looked at least a little remorseful but Rio’s attention was back on Agatha as she spoke, her voice surprisingly calm, “Because the courts move slower than I’d like them to.”</p><p>Rio was the one to stiffen this time. Agatha squeezed her ribs and Rio leant around to look at her properly, to see the expression on her face as for the first time to anyone, she was announcing that she’d pick Rio over Ralph.</p><p>That maybe, and here is where Rio’s hopeful heart skipped to, she she was already making moves to.</p><p>And Alice, ever the fixer for Rio, tried again. “You’re divorcing him?”</p><p>But Agatha had clearly said all she wanted to on the matter. She ducked down to kiss Rio’s shoulder and then from her position against it, her chin resting there, she looked up and said: “Ever thought about a career in journalism, Alice?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and sighed out, feeling Agatha’s thumb now start to rub soft circles against her skin, a private act of reassurance.</p><p>“You two could be so good together. I’m talking career-wise. Imagine, Jen. Imagine what we could do. Two Oscars between them. It would be stratospheric.”</p><p>“Agatha already <em>is</em> stratospheric. She doesn’t need Rio.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and felt Agatha pull back to sip her wine. And as Alice and Jen fell to bickering about what Rio could or couldn’t do for Agatha’s career Rio settled more against Agatha, stretched her neck as Agatha leant in to kiss her there, hummed quietly as Agatha pressed in.</p><p>The night went by a lot like that. With a lot of chatter from the other end of the couch, and less from Agatha and Rio. Rio was tired but Agatha behind her was exhausted. A true, deep, spiritual exhaustion that made her melt into Rio, her face never far from Rio’s skin, the line of her jaw, the crook of her neck.</p><p>When the clock struck eleven Rio made the executive decision to pull Agatha to bed. She blew a lazy kiss towards Jen and Alice and directed Agatha up the stairs to her room. Only to feel her stumble into her as she stopped unexpectedly in the doorway to her bedroom.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“It’s really just yours?”</p><p>“Ralph and I have slept separately for years.”</p><p>Agatha had flipped their positions now and she was the one to lead Rio into the room, confidently tugging Rio to the bed. “You’ll have to wear pyjamas. In case Nicky gets up. But he seemed pretty-…”</p><p>Agatha turned because Rio had stopped moving halfway into the room, her eyes sweeping the space as if to spot anything that might indicate Ralph’s taste, Ralph’s things, Ralph’s presence.</p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed and frowned across at Rio, her fingers already stretched out towards her. “Honey.”</p><p>Hesitance, and perhaps all other thoughts, were lost to Rio as she marched towards those outstretched fingers. She slotted between Agatha’s parted thighs and kissed her as if it were the entrance fee.</p><p>Agatha smiled into the kiss, fingers now entwined with Rio’s right hand, her own right hand now splayed over Rio’s lower back. “The haircut is doing things to me, you know.”</p><p>“Oh? This old <em>awful</em> thing. Is it the style or the thought behind it?”</p><p>“Both.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she kissed Agatha again and they remained this way for a while, keeping it chaste, until their teeth were brushed, their faces washed, and Rio was wearing a set of matching pyjamas with the familiar feel of Agatha pressed against her and her face squashed into her neck.</p><p>“Does she do it often?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Just appear?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to ask who Rio was referring to. She shifted back and looked up at Rio, frowning a little as she did. “No. She usually just comes for the holidays.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and brushed a strand of brunette hair back from Agatha’s eyes. “Why do you think she was punishing you?”</p><p>The pad of her middle finger traced down over Agatha’s cheekbone, mapping the line to Agatha’s lips until she could kiss her softly and Rio watched as whispered to her. “Ralph and I… we’ve been fighting. She’ll know that. Ralph reports back to her. She… keeps tabs.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand back around to brush through Agatha’s hair again, taking a second to process before she spoke, the strain in her heart clear in her voice. “You’re not beholden to your mother, Agatha. Or your husband.”</p><p>“I want to be beholden to you.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers froze, halfway down the length of Agatha’s long hair. She hesitated, felt her breath be taken away, her waist grabbed, her heart sing.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Will you promise me something?”</p><p>“Anything.”</p><p>“If…” Agatha’s gaze fell, it changed, it softened until it was gone. She closed her eyes, took a breath. “If this doesn’t work out between us, I’m not asking you to still see Nicky but if-…”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“No, please.” Rio moved her hand to Agatha’s cheek and felt the weight of her words settle in her stomach, making her feel suddenly cold despite the warmth of the bed. “Would you still be as you are with him? Still be-…?”</p><p>“Mi amor, why are you asking that? Do you want to break it off?”</p><p>“<em>No.</em> No that’s the <em>last</em> thing I want.”</p><p>Rio nodded, frowning as Agatha released her death-grip on her waist and instead moved to mirror the position of her own hand on Agatha’s face. “Then why are you asking?”</p><p>“If I can’t have you I want Nicky to have you. I can’t be the reason he-…</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“I’m just saying. I’m-…”</p><p>Rio pulled away, extricating herself with difficulty from Agatha’s clutches. The reaction was immediate, the panic severe. Agatha tried to cling on and Rio, who’d been trying to lift up and hover to the side, was now tugged over her, clung to, tethered.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Don’t pull away.”</p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, feeling the fingers still clutching at the silk of her borrowed pyjamas relax even a little as she carefully eased her body weight fully into Agatha.</p><p>“I want you to leave Ralph. I want to sleep with you every night. I want you to be mine and be proud to be mine. And I want you to understand that I would never do anything to upset Nicky. Even if…” and here she faltered, herein lay her fear. “Even if this doesn’t work.”</p><p>Beneath her Agatha felt stiff, her body rejecting whatever comfort Rio was trying to give. But her hold loosened until her hands became soft again, until they buried in the uneven strands of dark hair about Rio’s head. Her lips were soft too as Rio kissed them, her tears soft as they fell, one by one, travelling down her cheeks onto what should be her marital bed but was instead the bed she slept in alone - unless Nicky was with her - or like now, where her heart in another form lay above her, providing reassurance but not respite from her fears.</p><p>“Deberías dormir. Descansa sobre mí y te abrazaré.” <em>You should sleep. Rest against me and I’ll hold you.</em></p><p>Rio wiped away Agatha’s tears, kissed over the tracks, and rolled back over pulling Agatha with her until she could tuck her under her chin and begin the nightly ritual of brushing her fingers through her hair again.</p><p>Even as Agatha settled, even as her hold tightened and then began to relax as sleep began to take hold, Rio couldn’t relax her mind. In the dim she stared ahead of her, seeing on the nightstand the little bottle of pills she recognised from Italy. The bottle she hadn’t seen <em>since</em> Italy. It was evidence that in the nights they’d spent together since Agatha didn’t need her medication to sleep.</p><p>She allowed the little bottle to calm her racing mind. Agatha felt safe with her. Safe enough to leave her sleeping pills behind knowing she’d be okay to sleep with Rio there. A person in shark-infested waters wouldn’t break their raft. Agatha wouldn’t break it off. Surely, Agatha wouldn’t break it off.</p><p>Her fingers walked up the bed as Agatha’s breathing evened out against her, and below Agatha’s pillow she found the soft fabric she’d expected might be there. Her stolen shirt, now constantly kept close in every bed Agatha slept in.</p><p>Apart from their bed in Berkeley. Because Rio would be there instead.</p><p>She fingered the familiar fabric for a while and all she could think, all she could focus on was: Agatha loved her. She had to.</p><p>Rio fell asleep with her hand on her shirt and her arm around the woman who’d stolen it. In her sleep she dreamt again of Agatha, of the two of them curled together, only this time Nicky was there too: his hair was long once more, Agatha’s fingers dancing through it, they looked peaceful together, warm in Rio’s embrace.</p><h4>Monday</h4><p>“I gotta get up.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“Go back to sleep.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio yawned and huffed but the woman in her arms was suddenly gone and Rio curled in on herself to recapture the warmth.</p><p>The next time she woke she did so because she could feel eyes on her. She groaned quietly, rubbed at her eyes, and then blinked until the face came into view. Her face.</p><p>“Morning, kid.”</p><p>“Mama said I could come get you.”</p><p>“Mm’kay.”</p><p>Nicky grinned as Rio sat up slowly, continuing to frown as she stretched. “Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>She looked back around to Nicky and saw that he was still grinning - grinning so widely in fact that it made Rio grin right back at him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your hair!”</p><p>“My?” Rio reached to touch it and raised her brows, “What’s up with it, mellizo?”</p><p>“It looks-…” and Nicky giggled before he could tell Rio <em>exactly</em> how it looked. Rio hummed suspiciously and slipped from the bed to go and check in the mirror. She knew immediately why Nicky was laughing. Her hair was standing up in every direction. So messy that she wondered how she’d managed to do it when Agatha had been so tightly wound around her all night.</p><p>But then Nicky appeared in the mirror with her and his grin was as bright as anything so she decided she could live with a little messiness in exchange for keeping him like that.</p><p>Which is exactly why she found herself in the kitchen being laughed at by both Jen and Alice. Agatha at least had the decency to temper her laughter into a subtle smirk as she passed Rio a coffee.</p><p>“Sometimes it feels like you’re not even a movie star at all.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at her manager and felt a hand pat her head gently and Nicky said with a grin, “It looks so silly.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and shot Nicky a wink as Agatha clapped her hands, “Okay. Get dressed, please. We need to leave soon.”</p><p>“Okay, mama!”</p><p>He ran round to Agatha and whispered something in her ear before he ran off and Agatha smirked as Jen eyed her suspiciously. “What?”</p><p>“He wants me to ask if Rio will take him to school.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, “I can’t <em>believe</em> he prefers this,” she gestured vaguely to Rio who was now grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl, “over <em>me</em>. He’s had more ice cream than hot dinners this week!”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and motioned to Alice to leave. Quickly. They got out the kitchen just as Agatha began to raise her voice and they both giggled like school children as they scurried up the stairs to get away before Agatha and Jen really got into it.</p><p>“Your hair looks crazy, by the way.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she left Alice to slip into Agatha’s shower and wash out the kinks and knots that had made her hair look less than movie star chic.</p><p>With towel-dried hair she changed back into the clothes she’d arrived in. Her hoodie had seen better days but wearing the sleeves that bore the tears of Agatha Harkness she’d been allowed to dry wasn’t exactly a hardship and felt more like a badge of honour.</p><p>The goodbyes to Jen and Alice were quick only Jen clung to Rio a little more than she was expecting and Alice made her promise not to chop any more into her hair. But soon Agatha, Nicky, and Rio were on their way to Nicky’s school.</p><p>Rio had been handed the keys by Agatha on the way out the door and had been told that it would be good practice, driving a real car before she owned one.</p><p>On the drive Nicky was keen to pick Rio’s brain about the upcoming Celtics games and he asked several times if she would come over soon to play some more. And in between the basketball chat he even asked if she would sleepover again but in his room so they could eat ice cream and tell scary stories.</p><p>Rio agreed to this readily and enjoyed that Agatha kept her eyes on her the entire time. Whenever she glanced at her she was smiling, a peaceful, calm sort of smile that was the balm Rio needed to calm any residual fear.</p><p>When they pulled up at the school drop off Agatha jumped out with Nicky and Rio put the car in park, happy to wait patiently for Agatha to return. Only she wasn’t expecting the door to be ripped open and a little boy to throw himself into her arms.</p><p>“Come back soon, please.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she squeezed Nicky closer, nodding against him, “Of course, mellizo. I’ll see you very soon.”</p><p>He pulled back and grinned at her, touched the strands of her mess of a hair cut and then clambered back down to earth to head in to school with his mom.</p><p>Rio felt the sadness creep in again as she watched mother and son walk hand in hand to the entrance. She noted how people looked Agatha’s way and how Nicky shrank into his mom’s side. She saw walking into the school’s open oak door the little family that she wanted to call her own.</p><p>Agatha came back ten minutes later, huffing a little with the rush of cold air that came from the slammed door. “I told his teacher to keep an eye. To call if anything… he seems okay. He seems…”</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio reached for Agatha’s hand, making her turn to her, “I think the fact that he was bouncing around at breakfast this morning shows that he’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her fingers and looked down.</p><p>“Why don’t we stay? I’ll get someone to go back to the house and collect our things and-…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha looked stern suddenly, determined. “I want tonight.”</p><p>So Rio drove off, depositing Agatha’s clutching hand in her lap so she could manoeuvre them through the windy streets of the suburbs.</p><p>Until they were out of the greater Los Angeles area, the car was silent.</p><p>Agatha was staring ahead, her fingers only delicately toying with the fabric of Rio’s sweats, and Rio was concentrating hard on the road. Agatha’s truck was a lot different to her little hybrid.</p><p>“Have you seen <em>Notting Hill</em>?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, glanced sideways at Agatha who was now looking at her.</p><p>“Of course. Used to watch it when I was sick.”</p><p>“There’s a scene in it. After Julia sleeps with Hugh for the first time. They’re in bed. And she quotes Gilda Radner.”</p><p>Rio began to frown, trying to remember the scene, unsure what the quote was.</p><p>“They go to bed with Gilda, and wake up with me.” Agatha answered before Rio could ask.</p><p>Rio sat in it for a second, kept her eyes on the road for a few car lengths. But she turned back to Agatha and saw she was still watching her, her tired eyes somehow cautious.</p><p>“Tell me you’re not worried about…? <em>Agatha</em>. I would take you in any form you came. I’d love you if you were a worm.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“A worm. It’s-…” Rio bit the inside of her cheek. “Never mind.”</p><p>Her hand dropped down to Agatha’s in her lap and she turned it over so they could lock their fingers together. “I want to be with you. I don’t know how I can be more clear about that.”</p><p>“I know. I don’t mean…” Agatha sighed softly and Rio glanced at her again. “I just have a complicated life. And yours…”</p><p>“Mine is less complicated. Which means I have space for whatever you want to share with me. And I hope you’ll share everything.”</p><p>Rio glanced again and Agatha was staring down at their hands.</p><p>“Besides,” Rio tried with a smile as she looked up to the road once more. “It’ll won’t take me as long to wash and dry my hair now so more time for complicated things.”</p><p>“I still can’t believe you did that.”</p><p>“And risk looking less like my twin? No way.”</p><p>“If you wanted to look exactly like him,” Agatha raised their joined hands to poke her finger at Rio’s scalp, “You should have cut it to here.”</p><p>“I don’t have the bone structure for that.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and Rio grinned as she pulled her hand to her lips to kiss it.</p><p>“You should try to sleep. You look exhausted.”</p><p>“Charming, thank you, honey.”</p><p>Rio hummed and shook Agatha’s hand across the centre console. “Sleep. It’s a long drive.”</p><p>“I’ll stay awake for you. Keep you company.”</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio huffed, making Agatha’s head roll to look at her again, “Sleep. Really. It’s been a lot.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha insisted, rolling her head to face forwards again. “I don’t need sleep. I never sleep anyway.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this, having wanted to broach the subject of Agatha’s sleep for a while now, especially since spotting the little bottle of pills last night. “You sleep when you’re with me.”</p><p>“That’s different.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“If I’m asleep you talk less.”</p><p>“Oh very funny.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and Rio eyed her for a second before turning to the road. She tried to unwind their hands. Agatha clung on. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Taking my hand back.” She let it go limp in Agatha’s hold and didn’t have to look around to know Agatha was scowling.</p><p>“Tell me why you don’t sleep.”</p><p>Agatha seemed to think on it and then said, “Hold my hand properly.” Rio closed her fingers.</p><p>“Chronic insomnia,” Agatha huffed, looking down at their hands now resting in her lap, her right hand covering them. “I take a pill for it.”</p><p>“You don’t with me.”</p><p>“I told you yesterday,” Agatha fingers twitched, the mood shifting in the car. “I like to feel close.”</p><p>“Mi vida. Talk to me about it.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her hand dropped and Rio found that instead Agatha was shifting closer, sliding her hold down to grasp her thigh. Rio tried not to look down at it, tried to focus in, hoped Agatha would remain still if she wanted to get them back safely.</p><p>But it was comfort she sought, nothing else.</p><p>“I,” she began quietly, “sometimes get night terrors. It’s not unusual for me to get sleep paralysis. The pills help me get to sleep but they don’t prevent them from happening. I don’t get them when I’m with you.”</p><p>Rio sat in it for a second, her thigh muscles flexing and unflexing beneath Agatha’s fingers. “Do you know why you get them?”</p><p>“At this point I’ve pretty much nailed it down to the psychological torture of living with my mother, marrying a man, and… not being with who I want to be with.”</p><p>Rio glanced across at Agatha, saw she was watching her carefully, felt the hand slip further round her thigh, “Have you spoken to anybody about it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Do you think it would help?”</p><p>“Can’t you take the compliment and leave it at that?”</p><p>“I don’t always sleep with you, Agatha. I’m not always there. I want to be. I want you to be able to-…”</p><p>“I’ve looked into it,” Agatha said quickly, and Rio felt her fingers flex, pull back, now toying with the drawstrings of her sweats. “I know the guy I’d go to.”</p><p>“Then why haven’t you?”</p><p>“Because I’d have to admit to things I… things that are only between us right now.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and as gently as she could she removed Agatha’s hand and placed it in a safer spot near her knee. “Will you ever admit those things to anyone but us?”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away and Rio looked round at her, seeing her turn to look out the window. “Jen and Alice know.”</p><p>Rio shook her head a little because it wasn’t the same. Jen and Alice only knew because Agatha had reacted badly in London, lost her usual control upon seeing a hickey on Rio’s neck, been too loud, too insistent in a locked bathroom.</p><p>It wasn't the same. It wasn’t the same.</p><p>She wanted to scream it.</p><p>“Saturday was one of the hardest days of my life. And all I could think about was how much <em>easier</em> it would have been with you there.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes felt heavy suddenly, as if they could bear the weight of Agatha’s words. But she kept them open, kept her focus on the road. And as they drove on she wondered why Agatha would say things like this, skirt around the words she really wanted to hear, never offer to ease the fear that Rio was always too ready to ease for Agatha.</p><p>“I said it would have been harder. But you’d have made it easier. And that’s. That’s hard in itself.”</p><p>Rio gripped the wheel. Agatha looked down at her hands.</p><p>“Why is it hard?”</p><p>“Because…”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, fearful she might break the skin.</p><p>“Because,” Agatha’s hand stole her own from the wheel, “if my life were me, Nicky, and you, it would be so…”</p><p>Rio’s heart fell to her stomach.</p><p>“But it isn’t.”</p><p>“It could be.”</p><p>“It could be,” Agatha repeated quietly as she entwined their fingers again and Rio glanced as she kissed the back of her hand.</p><p>She didn’t push the subject again.</p><p>They were quiet for a while; Agatha’s hold now unyielding, Rio’s thoughts now unwinding. They swirled and lengthened and twisted. But they never relaxed, never gave her a second of peace even as topics changed to how funny it was that Alice was so mad about her hair, how protective Nicky was, how guilty Jen felt.</p><p>And all Rio could think about was that Agatha wanted it to be her, Nicky, and Rio.</p><p>But that it had been months now and she’d still not confirmed it.</p><p>She’d still not said she was leaving Ralph.</p><p>She’d only held on, only hinted, only nuzzled closer.</p><p>When they eventually arrived back to the house Rio no longer had time to think. Agatha was insistent, was desperate. With their clothes off and Agatha’s mouth and hands on her the thoughts stopped.</p><p>She was fully in her body once more. Fully Agatha’s. And Agatha was hers.</p><p>Agatha was clearly intent on making sure Rio didn’t have time to slip into her anxiety. She was hellbent on keeping her occupied. Even when they took a break for Agatha to make them grilled cheese she had her hand down Rio’s pants, half touching her, half just letting her know she wasn’t done yet.</p><p>And Rio knew that there was a countdown timer ticking away in both their minds. She knew that Agatha was anxious. She knew that their time together was precious because they <em>were</em> together but also because it was still stolen time.</p><p>They fell into bed around midnight and Rio ached for everything Agatha had done to her that day. She kissed her way to Agatha’s collarbone, nipping at the hot skin there, the skin that she’d been allowed to mark earlier in a particularly possessive display on the couch.</p><p>“When do you need to leave tomorrow?”</p><p>Agatha grunted quietly as Rio pulled up and kissed her. “Not too late. I want to be home before Nicky goes to bed.”</p><p>“Mm’kay. I was wondering,” and Rio rolled off of Agatha, already seeing her pale slightly, “can we talk about us? About what you said yesterday to Alice? About… where we go from here?”</p><p>And Rio was surprised to see Agatha smiling. She was grinning, bright and easy, as if she’d just read the stage directions and they said: “she smiles, she looks at ease, as if everything was suddenly right in the world.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio didn’t question the sudden change because she was tired, herself happy, and Agatha was already ducking down to bury her face against her chest.</p><p>Rio fell asleep like that, tucked in, entangled, warm and comfortable.</p><p>Agatha, however, only remained still, only held on, her smile having faded the moment she’d pressed back in.</p><p>Around three am she woke Rio up. She did it by kissing her, by brushing her fingers over her back.</p><p>Rio grunted and groaned and kissed Agatha back but frowned, refusing yet to open her eyes. “What time is it?”</p><p>“Just after three, baby.”</p><p>“Three? Mi amor. What is it?”</p><p>“It’s our last night, honey. Our last night here.”</p><p>Rio scowled as Agatha pushed her onto her back, her hands and lips letting Rio know what she wanted. “Agatha. It’s so early I’m so-…”</p><p>But Agatha had nipped at her pulse point, was now sucking on it, and Rio was awake suddenly, her body thrumming as every cell screamed: ‘AGATHA’.</p><p>“Would you,” Agatha began to say as she threw the duvet off from her back, scrambling down to push Rio’s shirt up, kissing down to her stomach, “strap me,” she pressed her open mouth to Rio’s hip, letting her feel her teeth, “down?”</p><p>Rio grunted out a laugh, “You can stop saying it like that.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said with a smirk, lifting up to look at Rio properly, “then will you fuck me?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but lost her train of thought as Agatha threw her shirt off and was beginning to wriggle out of her underwear. “Yeah, I mean, yeah…”</p><p>“The bigger one, baby. I want to feel you. Make me feel you for days.”</p><p>Like a baby gazelle spooked by a prowling lion, Rio stumbled from the bed, racing her own heart rate to get to the bathroom where the toys were all washed and cleaned and lying in wait in the bathtub.</p><p>By the time she was stumbling back, now with the harness in place, Agatha was lying in the middle of the bed. The duvet had been pushed to the foot and her legs were spread open, her hand working away at herself as Rio clambered back up.</p><p>“No lube, Rio.” She was breathing heavily, and Rio was torn between staring at where her fingers were disappearing into herself and the way her chest was heaving with each heavy breath. “As hard as you can.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“Baby, hurry.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered as she moved to kneel between Agatha’s legs, her eyes wide and so black the deep brown had disappeared along with her tiredness.</p><p>“I mean it,” Agatha said breathily, making a soft noise as she slid her hand back against herself and began to rub her clit. “Hard.”</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha.” Rio leant up a little, eyes now focused on Agatha’s pussy, on the pale fingers that were teasing it.</p><p>“Fuck me like you want to put a baby in me.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. Her gaze dragging up to Agatha’s face as she stared at her. As if to entice Rio more, though Rio didn’t exactly know <em>how</em> she could be more enticed, Agatha raised her free hand to her breast and began to palm at it roughly, making Rio’s greedy eyes fly to it.</p><p>But she remained still, unable to compute what she was being asked, no <em>baited</em>, to do.</p><p>Agatha had another trick up her sleeve though. Her breathing was getting heavier, now interspersed with moans, and she spoke in perfectly accented French before translating into Spanish. “Baise-moi, Rio. Quiero que me cojas.”</p><p>The two-for-one punch shocked Rio into moving. She lined herself up properly, not looking at what she was doing but knowing instinctively she had it right when Agatha’s moans got louder, when she began to whine a little as Rio gathered her wetness against her cock and looked away from her tits only to spit on it.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned and Rio mewed quietly, breaking from her trance to look down again, to line herself up properly, to press cautiously into Agatha.</p><p>“Fuck me, Rio. Now. Now!”</p><p>Rio wanted to oblige. She wanted to be good for Agatha, to do what she asked. But something made her stop. Something in the back of her mind made her hesitate.</p><p>Which didn’t make any sense because Agatha was practically hyperventilating beneath her,  practically coming already.</p><p>She slid her hands down herself as Rio remained still, only the tip of the strap now connecting them. But Rio’s eyes were focused on the long fingers that reached and she thought she was about to grab her to pull her in but instead she was opening herself up more for Rio to see.</p><p>“Watch it. Watch as you fuck me.”</p><p>Rio Elena Vidal, a woman who’d fucked half her dorm through sheer magnitude of her charm. An actress who had ‘turned’ straight peers, who had convinced others of their sexuality long before it had even been a question in their naive brains, who had fucked and been fucked in any which way until she found what she wanted, what she liked.</p><p>Or thought she had.</p><p>Because no one had ever made her feel the way she was currently feeling now that Agatha Harkness was naked and begging for her.</p><p>Her body won out before her brain could question her hesitation. She snapped her hips forwards and watched as she filled Agatha completely. Agatha’s hands spasmed and she jerked her body with a gasp as Rio came to her senses and did as she’d been asked.</p><p>She fucked Agatha with abandon, snapping her hips like a woman possessed, now leaning over her, now barely cognisant of the garbled moans and begged words: <em>harder</em>, <em>faster</em>, <em>deeper</em>.</p><p>It became possessive quickly. She became determined to do as Agatha had asked: to make her feel her for days, to fuck a baby into her if she could. Hell, she’d technically done it before. Maybe she could give her another Nicky. Another perfect clone of herself. Maybe the universe would be kind, maybe she could do it again.</p><p>Agatha came quickly, loudly, her legs forcing Rio’s hips down, close. And Rio stilled her hips, momentarily broken as Agatha whined and she blinked through tears as her body quaked. Soft suddenly, tender without any hesitation, Rio kissed over Agatha’s face and captured her halting breaths against her own mouth.</p><p>She began to pull away when Agatha began to whine some more, her hips stirring as she became uncomfortable with Rio resting still, buried inside her.</p><p>“No, don’t!”</p><p>Rio stopped immediately, and Agatha tightened her hold around her hips, lifting her own and whining more as she did. She was practically mewing now and Rio felt that same flare of possessiveness across her chest. Agatha’s eyes were closed but the tears were slipping from them, sliding delicately down the sides of her face.</p><p>She looked beautiful like this, barely in her right mind, clutching at Rio still, silently begging for her.</p><p>Rio raised her brows and took advantage of Agatha’s softly panting mouth by tracing the tip of her tongue delicately over her top lip. “Can you come again, cariño?”</p><p>Her hips began to move slowly, pressing deeper, making Agatha keen a little more. Rio couldn’t move much, could only grind as Agatha clung to her. Agatha was moaning again now, her eyes still shut but lashes fluttering as her body moved with Rio’s and dark eyes dropped to her pale, perfect tits as they bounced with every deep thrust.</p><p>Rio was rubbing herself off, the stimulation of her clit almost too much, but Agatha wasn’t letting go. The noise of it was filthy, each tight press of their hips together making the sound of Agatha’s desperation lewd and unashamed.</p><p>So hypnotised by Agatha’s tits bouncing, Rio missed it as Agatha opened her eyes and the hands that had been clutching at her shirt moved up to lift Rio’s face to look at her. “I’m yours. I’m yours. Tell me.”</p><p>Rio used the moment to break the hold Agatha’s legs had on her. She pulled back, pistoning herself slowly in and out of Agatha. She hadn’t come yet. She wouldn’t. She’d hold it in until Agatha was screaming again. And luckily for her, she knew it wouldn’t take long.</p><p>She let Agatha’s hands fall from her to clutch at the sheets. She lifted one of her legs up, then the other, pressing them slowly back against Agatha’s chest as she pulled out.</p><p>Agatha was swollen and the prettiest pink Rio had ever seen.</p><p>“Dime.” <em>Tell me</em>.</p><p>Rio gasped as Agatha did, as she pressed harder on her thighs, as she began to rub the length of her strap against Agatha’s pussy. As she nodded, as she breathed out, barely holding on to her control anymore.</p><p>“I’m yours,” she whispered, letting Agatha hold her own legs back as she lined herself up again and as she spoke once more she pressed fully into her. “You’re <em>mine</em>.”</p><p>Able to get deeper, able to rub circles around Agatha’s clit as she fucked her this time, Agatha came louder and harder than she had before.</p><p>She whined out as Rio leant over her properly and forced her legs back more as she kissed her, fucking her slowly still as she did.</p><p>She eventually pulled out but only when she noticed Agatha’s brow was furrowed in consternation and even then, Agatha protested and tried to pull Rio back.</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio cooed, “Do you know how swollen you look?” She replaced the strap with her hand and explored the damage with gentle fingers as Agatha relaxed her legs down. “God you took me so fucking well.”</p><p>“More, Rio. Fuck me again. Harder.”</p><p>Rio chuckled as Agatha twitched below her when she brushed past her clit, “Baby, you’re aching already.”</p><p>“I can take it.”</p><p>“<em>Mi alma</em>, tenemos tiempo. It’s es sólo esta noche.” <em>We have time. It’s not just tonight.</em></p><p>But Agatha’s eyes closed and Rio thought she looked paler again. She began to shift to throw the harness aside as she slipped out of it. Agatha was looking back at her now, frowning, crying once more and Rio couldn’t bear to ask why so she kissed her through it. She kissed her until Agatha was rolling them over, then travelling down her body, then pressing her mouth to where Rio needed her most.</p><p>Agatha ate her out with the same fierce determination she’d had when asking Rio to fuck her. She made her come in no time at all but stayed at it until she’d come twice, until she was rutting against the bed, until Rio was dragging her back up and kissing her again.</p><p>Breathless and now panicked, Rio held Agatha to her as she pressed in against her. She wrapped them both up in the duvet and tried to ignore the countdown timer that had started ticking aggressively in her mind.</p><p>Their time was running out. Agatha was frightened in her arms, but she couldn’t bring herself to reason why.</p><p>The time kept ticking.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Rio woke up that morning she woke up alone.</p><p>She’d barely slept but she’d eventually managed it around four in the morning when the sun was just rising and Agatha felt heavy and permanent in her arms.</p><p>She sat up slowly in the cold bed and groaned as she stretched her limbs and looked around for any sign of Agatha. The only thing she saw was her suitcase, standing tall by the bench at the end of the bed. Unopened still.</p><p>Agatha was in the kitchen, and when Rio went to hold her from behind and wish her a “good morning, mi amor”, she only hummed, only briefly touched Rio’s hand, only continued to make more coffee.</p><p>Throughout the rest of the morning Agatha was being distant, barely kissing Rio back when she went to kiss her. Their routine felt changed all of a sudden. The soft kisses between conversations, whenever they passed each other on the way to another room or to fetch more coffee, they were all one-sided.</p><p>Rio put it down to the fact that they were just a couple of hours away from leaving each other. Because Rio felt the pain of it so acutely that she was pushing it down, deciding that hiding behind their routine was the best way to go.</p><p>Clearly Agatha thought differently.</p><p>And something about the way Agatha had been so incessant yesterday. How she’d denied Rio the time to think. How she’d begged her to fuck her so insistently that there was no illusion of choice.</p><p>Rio <em>would</em> fuck her. Rio would put a baby in her.</p><p>But the hands that had been grasping and clawing yesterday were nowhere to be found today. In fact, Rio felt the absence of Agatha’s hands on her even when they were physically there. Because Agatha returned the hug she gave her when she pulled her in after taking her coffee mug to refill it. Agatha touched Rio’s hip when she squeezed around her to reach for a fresh glass. She nudged her foot when they sat together on the deck outside and drank their coffee talking about their journey ahead.</p><p>But that was it. Everything was gentle, everything was a goodbye.</p><p>By 10:30am Rio had packed her bag and was putting away the last of the clean dishes when something was set something in motion that couldn’t be stilled.</p><p>“Rio, I need to tell you something.”</p><p>Rio was stretching up at the time, on her tallest tiptoes to slot the plate into the floating grate that held its peers above the countertop. She froze, momentarily stationary in midair. Her fingers grazed the edge of the porcelain before they pulled away and in one slow, fluid movement she pirouetted until she was facing Agatha.</p><p>Agatha was wearing her hoodie, her black hoodie that bore the memory of Agatha’s tears. It made her look smaller somehow, maybe younger, but didn’t make her look any less terrified.</p><p>“This week has been,” she began again, her eyes darting down to Rio’s hands as they clutched the counter behind her, “It’s been the happiest I’ve felt in a long time. Other than Saturday when we were apart I… I need you to know that because what I’m about to tell you… I don’t want it to change that, to change what we could have.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and looked down at the floor, already sure that whatever Agatha was about to say would destroy her totally and utterly.</p><p>She’d known it in the way Agatha had been begging her yesterday, in the way she’d kept her occupied all night, in her strange absence this morning. The world had felt perfect for a few, shining, shimmering days.</p><p>And now it was dark again. And Rio knew she was about to be left alone.</p><p>“In London,” Agatha said slowly, “the night we all had dinner, the night you… <em>that</em> night… I slept with Ralph.”</p><p>Whatever Rio had been expecting, it wasn’t this. She’d perhaps thought that Agatha had simply changed her mind. That she thought Rio was cute and fun but not someone she wanted to build a life with. Or worse: that she loved her but she didn’t love her <em>enough</em>.</p><p>But, Ralph? Ralph she hadn’t factored into the equation. He’d been in her thoughts, yes, because he was Agatha’s husband, because he might try to stop a divorce or make a custody battle tricky.</p><p>But she never thought she’d be competing with him. Not in that way. Not in the way that… and as her eyes closed she got a flashback to the previous night. Flashes of Agatha begging her to go faster, harder, deeper, when she’d already told her how her and Ralph had sex.</p><p><em>“It was just always missionary, always perfunctory, always what I thought it should be.”</em></p><p>She’d been comparing them. She’d woken Rio on their last night together to compare her to her husband. The man she’d left her on her knees for.</p><p>Suddenly she felt familiar fingers grasp at her shirt, twisting the fabric until it was pulled taught about her shoulders and ribs, the cotton straining under Agatha’s insistence.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her name off her tongue, accentuating the purr of it. She said it like it was hers alone to utter. And Rio would have given it to her, told everybody else not to call her it anymore. Left ‘Rio’ to be the sole property of Agatha Harkness.</p><p>It belonged to Agatha. Rio belonged to Agatha.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t belong to Rio.</p><p>“You left me,” Rio breathed out, feeling her body try to stop her from saying it. “On my knees,” her throat began to close up. “After I told you I loved you,” her hold tightened on the marble counter behind her. “To let <em>him</em> <em>fuck</em> you?”</p><p>A soft gasp was all Rio got in response. A soft pair of lips against her cheek, the press of a perfect nose into the sensitive skin by her ear.</p><p>It would have been too easy to melt into it. To let Agatha roll her heart around on her tongue like she’d just rolled her name. Because Agatha felt soft and warm against her. She was nuzzling in, taking advantage of Rio’s position against the counter to press herself as close as she’d ever been. Rio could have believed she felt safe if it weren’t for the fists she was still making in her t-shirt, if it weren’t for the desperate hold she had on her even as her lips continued their soft acts of contrition over her face.</p><p>Rio allowed it for a while, feeling the way her heart beat its tattoo against her ribcage, until she forced herself to speak again.</p><p>“This is the second time,” she said carefully, feeling Agatha move back a little, “the second time you’ve wanted me but left me for Ralph.”</p><p>Her eyes opened and Rio regretted allowing them to do so almost immediately because the sight before her was something she never wanted to see again.</p><p>Agatha’s sea glass eyes were filled with tears, her skin a ghostly pallor, her lips pink and trembling.</p><p>“It’s different,” she uttered quietly and Rio felt her twist her shirt harder, and wondered how much more tension it could take before it simply ripped apart.</p><p>“Tell me how.”</p><p>“I…” a silent tear fell from Agatha’s right eye and Rio instinctively reached to wipe it away. The touch made Agatha’s lower lip tremble and her lashes flutter as she continued, “I-I needed to feel… I needed…”</p><p>Rio had pulled her hand back now and it hung loosely at her side, the pad of her damp thumb brushing absently against her pointer finger, brushing away Agatha’s tear until it dried and became part of her.</p><p>“I was so angry.”</p><p>Another tear fell, and then another, and another. All Rio could do now was watch as Agatha cried, as she twisted her shirt, as she broke down.</p><p>“I was so-so… it didn’t mean… Rio, it didn’t mean…”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and shook her head. Agatha pressed into her again so suddenly and so insistently that her body released a gasp before her mind could catch on.</p><p>But the wiring of her brain was fraying and crackling. She couldn’t get a hold on what her reaction should be because Agatha was so soft now, so sad as she began to convulse with her tears and the hands that had just been twisted in her shirt were now clawing at her back.</p><p>“Please, Rio… please understand that-…”</p><p>“Our first night together,” Rio began, living now in her memories because living in the here and now was too much. “You told me you wanted me so badly you let… Ralph fuck you. That it gave you Nicky. That <em>I</em> gave you Nicky.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha began to chant, in her desperation the sound of her name morphed into soft Spanish: “Por favor, por favor entienda. Por favor.” <em>Please, please understand. Please.</em></p><p>“You told me to put a baby in you last night. Does that mean you’ll go back to Ralph tonight? Get him to? Call it mine?”</p><p>“No no no,” Agatha pleaded, and despite the words she'd just spat, Rio had no choice but to loop her arms around her, so complete was Agatha's breakdown that she was no longer clawing but <em>pawing</em> at Rio as she shook and sobbed in equal measure.</p><p>Agatha could never have known that in having Rio hold her she was giving her time to process and that for Agatha, that could never be a good thing. Not now. Not anymore.</p><p>But Rio did hold her, she held her until Agatha was making soft choked noises as she tried to control herself, and kept her face buried against Rio’s throat, hiding from her even as she held on.</p><p>Rio stared straight ahead, unable to control the bile that had initially been simmering and now was boiling over.</p><p>“I need to leave.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold tightened as Rio’s loosened. They were pulling in opposite directions suddenly; or, Agatha was pulling and Rio began to push.</p><p>“No, Rio. No. Don’t. Let me explain. Let me-…”</p><p>“I thought you’d be ready. I thought I’d given you time and you were-…”</p><p>“Rio, don’t. <em>Don’t</em>. I made a mistake. I got scared I-…”</p><p>Rio had won the battle as she slipped around Agatha, still gently pushing away at the hands that tried to grab her back. Her shirt was sodden around the collar now, her neck itching and red from the tears that had been pressed against it.</p><p>And she felt out of herself. She felt other. Because she knew herself as Agatha’s and suddenly she didn’t feel that anymore. She was alone again.</p><p>Rio had hold of Agatha’s wrists, a firm but gentle hold that was defensive and done to stop Agatha from catching her once more, from pulling her back close. And through the framing of her fists raised to the sky Rio looked for the second time properly at Agatha’s face.</p><p>Her usually perfect skin, the skin that had just had a ghostly pallor was now pink and blotchy. And her eyes were so red that Rio would not be able to close her eyes for weeks to come without seeing that exact shade of carmine red reflected right back at her.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something but Rio was already shaking her head, already pulling away.</p><p>“No. No. Where-… where are you going?”</p><p>A step forward became two steps back as Agatha grabbed at her again, tugging her backwards, trying to get her to turn.</p><p>“I’m going home, Agatha.”</p><p>The calm of her voice was a misnomer because every cell of Rio’s body was on fire. Every breath she took was toxic. Every movement away from Agatha felt sharp and wrong.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Rio had made it to the living area of the space. She’d made it to just past the couch in their first ever home together when the very walls began to shake with the terror that reverberated from Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“See?! You’re a COWARD, Rio! A COWARD! You’re a CHILD! You could <em>never</em> be mature enough for this! You could <em>never</em> make this work!”</p><p>Rio stopped where she was, her body frozen in place. She rested a shaking hand on the corner of the couch to steady herself as Agatha continued.</p><p>“<em>LOOK</em> at me! You could never be right for me! You could never be enough! You could never be-…!”</p><p>Agatha had lost it. Agatha <em>was</em> losing it. She was lashing out because Rio had pulled away and Rio couldn’t be sure but it felt false, it felt desperate, it felt like a last ditch-attempt to rile Rio up into fighting her. Because perhaps to Agatha a fight was better than a refusal.</p><p>Rio fell down into her memories again. Though this time it didn’t feel safe.</p><p>She could feel the warmth and desperation of Agatha against her mouth and how it juxtaposed with the coldness of her as she’d stood, as she’d pulled away, as she’d left her.</p><p>She should have known then. In the desperation Agatha had exacted on her tongue, how she’d used her mouth as if it had been formed for her alone as she took and took and took. She should have seen the inevitable in the way Agatha had pulled away, how she’d <em>looked</em> away, how her jaw had flexed and her eyes had gone cold and icy and she’d left her.</p><p>She should have stopped her, she should have grabbed her back and made her stay.</p><p>She should have pressed her against the door and been insistent with her hands, her tongue, her words.</p><p>She should have told her she loved her on her two feet and told her to say it back. She should have begged her to say it back or to release her.</p><p>Because now her inability to do any of those things had set off a bomb in her brain and a fire in her soul.</p><p>Agatha, her <em>media naranja</em>, the woman she’d promised her dad had deserved to have her, had never been ready.</p><p>It had always been there, Rio just hadn’t wanted to see it.</p><p>So Rio came back to herself and turned around to face the version of Agatha Harkness she’d never thought she’d see - had barely thought existed. But Agatha, upon seeing Rio’s face, upon looking at the silent tears that flowed freely down her cheeks had recoiled as if she were ashamed of the sound and the fury that she alone had conjured in the space between them.</p><p>Her heavy breathing remained shallow as the fists curled up at her sides opened and went limp.</p><p>“Is that how you really feel, Agatha? That I’m not mature enough? That… that the man who-who…”</p><p>She stuttered, clutching at the consonants and vowels that were jumbled in her brain, stuck for some reason. Had she been protecting Agatha? Had she simply not wanted to face the fact that Agatha was married to <em>that</em> type of man?</p><p>“Who <em>groped</em> me at the Oscars. The fucker who fucks other women and thinks he has the right to my-…”</p><p>It was too much.</p><p>The blow had been delivered with precision. A sickle in the night. A clean slice about Agatha’s chest, piercing her tattered heart.</p><p>A brief, glimmering moment of satisfaction pierced Rio’s soul as she saw the great Agatha Harkness cower back from where she’d just been bellowing her contempt. But it was replaced soon with regret as Agatha began to mumble her name, mumble the word ‘no’ over and over again.</p><p>Rio had to watch it, had to watch what she’d done, not cognisant enough to register that this was Ralph’s doing, not hers.</p><p>But she’d delivered the news and she suddenly wanted to shoot the messenger.</p><p>Agatha’s pale fingers were now fisting at the fabric of Rio’s stolen hoodie, hiding their pain in the threads of the sweater Rio had worn almost every week for over a decade.</p><p>“He touched you,” Agatha breathed out, her voice giving out after yelling so furiously before.</p><p>So full were her eyes, so insistent her tears, that now Rio could barely make out the woman she’d once known as <em>mi amor</em>, <em>mi vida</em>, <em>mi alma</em>.</p><p>But she’d rather go blind than see what had happened to Agatha.</p><p>The silence that came after the reveal was too much now. Too much for Rio to stand in, to shake off.</p><p>“I’m too childish? Too immature? Not enough?”</p><p>“No that-…”</p><p>Agatha had stepped forwards and Rio stepped back, blocked from going any further by the couch. “Was it just fun? Just a warm body and a willing tongue?”</p><p>“I… no, Rio. Please. No. <em>Please</em>. I’m sorry. I’m so-… Lo siento, lo siento…”</p><p>Her Agatha was back. Her Agatha who was trembling where she stood, no longer reaching for Rio but whimpering her name instead.</p><p>“Tell me why you went back to Ralph. Why you-… Agatha tell me why you left me for him. Used me to make you wet enough so that… that you could fuck your fucking bastard husband? Tell me. <em>Tell</em> me.”</p><p>Agatha looked suddenly like a scolded puppy; all wide eyed and trembling lips.</p><p>And Rio felt her heart break. The sinews and the fibre no longer held it in place in the hollow of her chest. Instead they were torn apart because she realised something that should have been so plain to see this whole time: Agatha didn’t know why she’d done it.</p><p>A reason. A true, godforsaken answer would have hurt. It would have <em>killed</em> her. But no reason at all, just Agatha returning to her husband when she felt something for Rio, when she felt <em>too much</em> for Rio.</p><p>That was worse than death.</p><p>That was pain immutable, pain until now unfathomable.</p><p>Because it couldn’t be fixed. It couldn’t be changed.</p><p>Rio had no power over it - no time she gave Agatha could heal it.</p><p>Agatha knew it too because her next words, garbled and hurried, grasping like her hands had been earlier: “I was scared a-and… and angry and-… and I-I wanted you. Please I… I want you. I-… I didn’t mean I-…. He-he touched you? He touch-…”</p><p>Agatha’s words dissolved in her tongue, transmogrifying into whimpers as she began to cry harder than before.</p><p>“I deserve… I deserve more than that. A-and I thought you did too.”</p><p>“No. No. Rio… <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Rio finally wiped at her eyes, finally got rid of the tears that had blinded her and she saw before Agatha as she truly was. She was in more pain than Rio could bear to see. She looked like a broken version of herself; agonised and trembling.</p><p>Rio almost reached for her.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She wondered if she had what Agatha would have done.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re ready for this.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha, I think…”</p><p>Three strides was all it took for Agatha to be back against her. She held her and Rio allowed herself to <em>be</em> held.</p><p>It was a biological imperative that Rio cling to her now. That she fold her arms around Agatha and hold her so tightly it was like she’d never let go.</p><p>But she’d already decided she had to.</p><p>“Don’t say it, I… Rio, I didn’t mean… I was s-scared a-and…por favor, Rio...por... f-favor...”</p><p>Rio shook her head, feeling Agatha curl more into her, her fingers clutching at her shirt again. “I need… Agatha I need a second. Can you just… can you give me… I…”</p><p>And Rio released a sob, it wracked her body and made Agatha cling harder, press closer. And now as Rio cried she kissed over her face again, fractured, uneven nudges of her lips against Rio’s hot, damp skin.</p><p>Her Agatha was soft again, her Agatha was desperate again. Her Agatha was hers again.</p><p>“A-Agatha, I need… <em>please</em>.”</p><p>And Agatha pulled back enough to let Rio breathe. The inch or two of space between them now was enough to let Rio drop her head, for Agatha to slip her fingers into the short, uneven strands of hair, and for Rio to feel the soft patter of her breath as she kissed the top of her bowed head.</p><p>“Loving you is so easy,” she whispered as soft fingers began to draw patterns over her scalp, massaging with the delicacy of a person who regretted their earlier explosion. “Why are you making it <em>hard</em>?”</p><p>Rio hiccuped quietly and Agatha dipped her head down to find Rio’s gaze, to press into her face, to ghost their lips together. Rio whimpered and Agatha held back a sob.</p><p>“I wanted to tell you. I tried… I…”</p><p>Rio pulled back slightly and Agatha looked terrified again but Rio had to take a second. She had to keep breathing even as her lungs demanded she stopped, as her body demanded she give in.</p><p>“I was on my knees for you. I have been… this whole time. I-I’ve waited and given a-and… Agatha, you let me fall in love when you’ve had no intention of… of…”</p><p>“Rio.” And there it was again. That perfect mouth forming those two syllables she’d heard and responded to her whole life. Her name that she only ever wanted to hear on the lips of the woman who clung to her in any form she'd give it to her: whispered, screamed, moaned.</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio uttered despairingly as she began to extricate herself from Agatha’s hold.</p><p>Agatha put up a fight until she suddenly didn’t. And as Rio pulled away from her fully she began to shake so violently she had to hold onto the couch to support herself.</p><p>Rio had anticipated it might happen again. That Agatha might lose her shit once more because Rio had turned away from her properly, because Rio was <em>moving</em> away from her. And so when Agatha began to scream this time she was prepared.</p><p>“No! NO! Coward! COWARD!”</p><p>The gut punch wasn’t so brutal but the words reverberated around her mind like the echoes of distant thunder, mighty in its reckoning but underneath the clap: harmless, and as they faded she felt the weight of what was happening settle in her bones.</p><p>She was leaving Agatha.</p><p>The silence that followed cut deeper than the anger, than the panic, and in its stillness it carved out a place in Rio’s heart where certainty had once lived.</p><p>As Rio kept her back to her, Agatha hit the deck.</p><p>Rio strode with unfeeling legs until she reached the door and as her hand came into contact with the handle Agatha’s screamed sobs became choked and Rio couldn’t not look.</p><p>She would always look.</p><p>She would always turn back.</p><p>To love is to turn around.</p><p>The woman she knew she would love until her last breath was clutching at her chest on the floor, her eyes wide and frightened as she continued to choke on her own tears. She was convulsing, out of her mind with fright, and Rio could only watch, could only hope that one day Agatha would forgive her this: for leaving her, for not being strong enough to hold the both of them anymore.</p><p>Rio was frozen in place as Agatha delivered the coup de grâce, a faltering, broken: “I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Her words were raspy and free from the violence of her previous shouts but they hurt worse than anything Agatha had told her that day because Rio had wanted to hear them for so long. She’d been desperate for Agatha to say it out loud.</p><p>And now it was too late.</p><p>Rio turned away and left their home, leaving her heart fallen to her knees in desperation on the floor, her blue-red eyes staring up at the place Rio had just disappeared.</p><p>Rio Vidal, Academy Award Winner, Lover of Agatha Harkness, Frightened, Crying Mess, started to run the moment her tongue tasted fresh air. She ran until she couldn’t anymore and collapsed onto the ground in a ball of anguish and despair.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t followed her.</p><p>Rio had left the house with nothing but the clothes on her back and her phone wedged somewhere in her pocket. She fished it out and blindly tapped until she’d ordered an uber to take her home.</p><p>The uber arrived just as her phone flashed with a warning of ten percent battery. But Rio was on less than that. She clambered in, nodded politely when the driver confirmed her name, and proceeded to cry the whole way home.</p><p>The drive home was long, and interminably slow.</p><p>The traffic piled up around Bakersfield and Rio found herself irrationally angry at whoever had decided that the 5 would allow other people to drive on it when she alone suffered more than anyone else in the world.</p><p>But she got home eventually. A shell of her former self, but an alive one, because she’d just about managed to keep breathing, despite the agony.</p><p>But home didn’t feel much like it had before. Her soft couch wasn’t as welcoming. Her even softer pyjamas weren’t as comforting. The only thing that was as it always had been was the burn of the tequila as she practically poured it down her throat.</p><p>It was barely seven, and she was already drunk.</p><p>But drunk was better than aware.</p><p>Each thought brought with it the promise of pain. Each memory of Agatha was now laced with the keen sting of betrayal. But worse than what Agatha had done - worse even than the knowledge that when Rio had been on her knees for the woman she’d still chosen her husband - was the reminder of the absolute certainty she’d had that Agatha was it for her.</p><p>There was no one else. Just Agatha Harkness and the destruction she’d left behind.</p><p>Rio had been fooling herself for years now that she needed a new woman every night to keep herself from being lonely. She’d tricked herself into believing she could function with situationships and holiday romances.</p><p>And then she’d met a woman she gave all that up for without even taking a second to think.</p><p>She’d fallen into blue eyes and had slipped deeper and deeper until she realised that Agatha wasn’t her salvation, she was her damnation.</p><p>The tequila helped but it didn’t cure.</p><p>She passed out on the couch and woke only when the heavy sound of a heavy fist on her heavy door jolted her awake.</p><p>“Jesus. Fuck.”</p><p>Rio had jammed her foot into the corner of the table leg in her haste to get to the door. The cursing continued as she hobbled over and without thinking she ripped her heavy wooden front door open.</p><p>There, on the doorstep, was Jennifer.</p><p>“No. Absolutely-,” Rio began, already closing the door. But Jen had reached a hand out, held the door open.</p><p>“Rio. Let me in. Please. Just let me come in.”</p><p>Rio applied a little more pressure but Jen didn’t let up. She stared at her, seeing the determination in dark brown eyes, and she relented. Jen stumbled as she did but Rio didn’t reach to help and only stepped aside to let her in.</p><p>“How much have you had already?.”</p><p>Rio scoffed as she closed the door and locked it behind her. She turned to follow Jen inside where she’d already taken the liberty of welcoming herself into Rio’s home.</p><p>Rio slipped past her and sat back on the couch as Jen picked up the half empty tequila bottle and inspected it. What she was looking for, Rio didn’t know.</p><p>“If you’re here to tell me it isn’t a big deal, then-…”</p><p>“I know what a big fucking deal it is, Rio. I’ve just spent the last few hours trying to stop Agatha from-…” but she stopped and shook her head, taking a few deep breaths before she said: “I’m not,” Jen whispered, placing the bottle back down and perching on the edge of the couch. Rio pulled her knees up to her chest. “She was supposed to tell you the night you spent together after the CCA’s. She tried-…”</p><p>Rio laughed bitterly and reached for the tequila. “Want one?”</p><p>“No. Rio. Listen to me.” Rio took a swig from the bottle and grimaced. “She tried to tell you at the BAFTAs but you were-.”</p><p>“Not hard enough,” Rio said as she cleared her throat and pulled her legs back to her chest, now cradling the bottle against her thighs.</p><p>“She <em>tried</em>. She knew she’d made a mistake immediately. You spooked her with that goddamn hickey and then-…”</p><p>Rio was shaking her head, fearing if she didn’t concentrate she might vomit.</p><p>“She made a mistake.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“She <em>loves</em> you, Rio.”</p><p>“Apparently not,” Rio said quietly, her gaze dropping to the black label on the bottle. “Said I was too childish. Too young. Too immature for her to ever love me…. For this to work.”</p><p>“That’s… she told me.”</p><p>Rio paused where she was just about to take another sip and turned to Jen, looking at her for the first time since she’d arrived at the door.</p><p>“I’ve just been with her for the past five hours. She’s a mess. I’m surprised she made it home in one piece.”</p><p>Rio looked away again from Jen’s tired features and shook her head. “I don’t want to hear it, Jen.”</p><p>“But you need to. You need to understand-…”</p><p>Rio took another swig of tequila but the bottle was ripped away just as the burn hit her palate and the clear liquid sloshed down her front. “Jesus, Jen!”</p><p>“Don’t you dare try to drink your way out of this. You need to <em>listen</em> to me.”</p><p>Rio scoffed as she stood up, shaking out the front of her Celtics t-shirt to get the dampness away from her chest. “What else is there to say.”</p><p>“That she knows she’s fucked it, Rio. That I just had to put her to bed. That she’s smashed plates and yelled herself hoarse and couldn’t even keep it together when Nicky came to see.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and turned away but remained standing by the couch with the tequila hanging by her side.</p><p>“She’s a mess.”</p><p>“Was Nicky okay?” Rio mumbled, now running a hand through her hair and keeping her eyes anywhere but on Jen.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio said in a louder voice. “Did he… witness the plate smashing?”</p><p>“No.” Jen was frowning now, reaching slowly for the bottle and taking it from Rio’s hand. “No. Just heard it. But he saw her crying. She usually wouldn’t I don’t think but… she couldn’t stop.”</p><p>Rio only nodded as a wave of nausea washed over her and she closed her eyes to try and focus on not letting it overspill.</p><p>“Rio. She was angry and confused and-“</p><p>“She left me on my knees. I told her I <em>loved</em> her and she left me. I forgave her because… because I thought she still needed time but that she felt the same but-…”</p><p>“I’m telling you she does love you.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes and saw that Jen was now standing. The tequila was on the coffee table again and Jen looked as though she were about to reach for her hand but something had stopped her.</p><p>“She said she doesn’t. That she couldn’t. And only when I was leaving did-...”</p><p>“Haven’t you ever met a feral cat before? They attack when cornered.”</p><p>Rio laughed and stepped away from Jen, intent on not being touched, and she sat at the end of the couch again. “She’s not feral. She’s-“</p><p>“Okay, a stray then. An <em>abused</em> cat. A frightened one.”</p><p>The nausea swelled again and Rio shut her eyes once more, her knees back against her chest.</p><p>“Rio, please. I-“</p><p>“It’s three in the morning, Jen. You should go home.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving until you change your mind about this.”</p><p>Jen was back on the sofa again, closer this time. Rio curled more into herself.</p><p>“She can go back to her perfect little life and-“</p><p>“Don’t be a dick, Rio. You <em>know</em> she doesn’t love Ralph.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, the part of her that wanted to forgive Agatha at war still with the rest of her. The anger that she knew Jen was right and yet her Agatha had gone back to him again, would continue to go back to him, would never run to Rio when she was scared.</p><p>“She made me love her,” Rio admitted in a small voice, a broken one. “She made me love him.”</p><p>“Him?”</p><p>“Nicky. She let me believe that-… that maybe…”</p><p>But Rio couldn’t bring herself to say it. The hand that curled in her ruined hair flexed and tugged and the sharp pain at the roots made her whimper as fresh tears fell. Being a family with Agatha and Nicky had been a pipedream. Had always been a stupid, <em>immature</em>, fantasy.</p><p>Maybe Agatha had been right.</p><p>“Look,” and Jen reached out to place her hand on her knee.</p><p>“Don’t, Jen.” Rio’s voice was softer, and she twitched her knee away.</p><p>“She’s leaving him, Rio.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, feeling the sharpness of the air as it hit her lungs.</p><p>“She told me tonight. What she said to Alice the other day was true. I’d guessed it already but… she’s still leaving him. Even if… she doesn’t want to lose you. But she thinks she already has and she’s still leaving him. She doesn’t want him. She wants you. And she’s…”</p><p>“Jen, please. I can’t talk about it.”</p><p>“You <em>have</em> to.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and rubbed her face with her hands. “I need some time. I told her I needed time.”</p><p>“She thinks you’ve broken it off. For good, Rio.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t answer the plea in Jen’s words. She could only keep her gaze down, keep her fingers still by twisting the fabric of her sweats. They were both silent for a while before Jen spoke again. Her voice was softer, somehow tentative. It sounded unusual to Rio’s ears.</p><p>“There’s something else. Something you’ll find out in a few hours anyway. Alice will get a call.”</p><p>Rio frowned and slowly turned to Jen who looked horrified that she was the one saying this.</p><p>“Agatha is playing Kate. She took the role from Wanda a few weeks ago. They’ve been hashing out the details and deciding how best to break the news but the call will come through in a few hours. Wanda will be on a flight to Atlanta a couple hours after that and Agatha will be at the read through with you tomorrow.”</p><p>Jen barely paused for breath during her little speech and Rio stopped breathing too. The betrayal hot and sharp in her chest.</p><p>The sting of Agatha’s manipulation of Rio, of Wanda, of the <em>studio</em>.</p><p>It was as if she’d been blind this whole time. Because Agatha as she knew her, as she was with her when they were alone was soft and gentle and perfect. And yet, and yet…</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“No. She. No.”</p><p>Jen frowned more and turned more into Rio, “Rio. It’s happening. Agatha will be playing-“</p><p>“<em>Don’t say it</em>.”</p><p>Throwing herself from the couch she began to pace. “Wanda doesn’t know?”</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Jen. Does Alice know?”</p><p>“No. She’ll find out in a few hours.”</p><p>Rio rocked her head back and was horrified to find that, defying gravity, her eyes began to shed the tears that they’d been threatening since Jen had arrived.</p><p>“I can’t be her wife.”</p><p>“You have no choice.”</p><p>“I’ll pull out. I’ll pay the fine, whatever it costs I-…”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I don’t care Jen. Alice will get me out of it and I-.” But Rio had wheeled around, too distraught to care now about the tears streaming down her face. Only the look on Jen’s face stopped her in her tracks. She looked pained, as if this conversation were as tough for her as it was for Rio. Though Rio couldn’t imagine a world where it would be.</p><p>“Rio, it’s why Evanora did what she did to Nicky. It’s why she came down and-… she found out Agatha was playing a lesbian, that she’d <em>campaigned</em> to get it, it was punishment. It was-…”</p><p>“You can’t turn this around, Jen. You can’t make me-.”</p><p>“Look I know what she’s done is terrible, Rio. I know you’re hurt. But <em>please</em> try to see how much she’s changed, how much she’s <em>trying</em>.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The eruption came from nowhere. But it had been bubbling since Agatha’s revelation all those hours ago.</p><p>And before Rio knew what she was doing she was throwing the bottle of tequila across the room and watching it smash against the wall.</p><p>Jen jumped out of her skin, her eyes wide and fingers splayed in front of her but whether to protect herself or reach for Rio, even Jen didn’t know.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio released a cry of frustration and Jen moved without her knowledge and before she knew it she was gathering her in her arms. Rio cried against her and Jen didn’t even complain as she ruined her silk blouse.</p><p>Agatha had lost it with her twice in the span of barely thirty minutes. She’d screamed at her all the things Rio had worried she might think of her. Though they were all things Rio knew to be untrue.</p><p>And she had said she loved her. But only at the last minute. Only when Rio had been practically out the door. Only when Agatha had one last shot at making her stay.</p><p>And now she was to be her wife. She would have to fake being married to her. She would have to be intimate and loving with her when the thought of being close to her again made her want to run. It made her want to hide. It made her continue to cry. It made her yearn.</p><p>By the time she’d calmed down enough Jen was able to half support, half guide her up to her bedroom. Rio didn’t protest when Jen peeled back the sheets for her and stepped aside to let her in.</p><p>“She loves you, Rio. She is a mess. But a mess who loves you. Sleep it off. And in a couple hours, when the news breaks, you might feel differently. <em>Please</em> feel differently.”</p><p>Rio rubbed uselessly at her eyes as they continued to stream with tears. Jen remained soft for her and it was almost too much to bear because the only softness she craved was from the woman who’d just broken her, and who she’d broken in return.</p><p>“I love her, Jen. I love her so-… so much. I thought she would never-…”</p><p>“I know. I know you do. She loves you too. Please believe that.”</p><p>Rio hiccuped quietly, using the sheets now to dry her face.</p><p>“She left me to go back to him. She-…”</p><p>“She was scared, Rio.”</p><p>“She could have told me. She could have used her w-words. She could have…”</p><p>“She needs time.”</p><p>“I’ve given her that. I’ve waited and pined a-and…”</p><p>Jen shifted on the bed and for a brief, horrifying moment Rio thought she was going to leave her.</p><p>“Agatha doesn’t lose it like this. She screams sometimes and she shouts but… never so bad Nicky would be aware. Never so extreme she destroys half her china. Give her some time, okay? Please let her work through it. Let her come back to you. Don’t give up on her.”</p><p>Rio just shook her head, pressing her palms so aggressively into her eyes she felt she might go blind.</p><p>The room was silent for a while and soon she felt the bed shift as Jen stood from it. Her fear had subsided now and she felt the need to be left alone - fitting, really. Alone was how she was best.</p><p>“If you need anything, call me. And please reconsider. Please don’t give up on her.”</p><p>A soft pair of lips pressed into her temple and Rio quivered as Jen pulled away and left her alone. From where she sat curled in on herself in the bed she listened to the soft sounds of glass being swept up until she heard her front door opening and closing.</p><p>Alone again, naturally.</p><p>In her drunken, broken state she managed to sleep.</p><p>But sleep came with terrors.</p><p>In them she saw blood-red eyes swallowing the usual green-blue. She saw pale hands curling until they were around her throat, and squeezing, squeezing until Agatha was standing over her and sobbing.</p><p>She had something in her hand.</p><p>Something blackened, something rotten.</p><p>And Rio realised as she clutched at her chest that it was her heart.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t taken it, it had been freely given, and it had been destroyed in the process.</p><p>Rio woke with a start, sweaty and alert, to the sound of her front door opening.</p><p>Her name being called.</p><p>The familiar sound of Alice’s heavy footsteps.</p><p>“Hey! Wake up! I’ve got <em>incredible</em> fucking news! I just had a call! RIO! You’re not going to fucking believe this but Agatha is your wife! <em>Agatha is your wife</em>!”</p><p>Her bedroom door opened.</p>

<p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t bring herself to look at Alice. She just stared somewhere around her black leather boots. They were well-worn, the leather expensive but rough in the places Alice’s foot had forced it to bend and stretch over the years.</p><p>And Rio was reminded suddenly of her equally well-loved duffel bag of clothes she’d left in the rented house up in the hills. She wondered if Agatha might have left it, or if she’d burn it, perhaps even toss it from the balcony.</p><p>Or maybe Agatha would be more careful with her bag than she was with her heart.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Alice’s soft voice shook her to her senses and before she could even look up she found gentle hands on her warm cheeks and a sweet kiss to her brow.</p><p>She said nothing. Alice just knew.</p><p>Her arms wrapped snugly around her best friend and she pressed against her but no tears fell this time. She’d cried them all out. Alice was silent, giving Rio the time she needed to just be held, until eventually she couldn’t keep it in anymore and she whispered: “What happened, Rio?”</p><p>Rio told her everything. In soft, truncated sentences because the truth was too painful to be an eloquent soliloquy.</p><p>She spoke for almost ten minutes until her voice was fading and Alice, who had sat stoic and simmering the whole time, suddenly broke the silence.</p><p>“We can get you out of it. Let me make a call.”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio whispered, her chin resting neatly on her friend’s shoulder as she continued to cling to her. “We don’t have that kind of money.”</p><p>“We’ll find it.”</p><p>A slow warmth spread through Rio then, a burgeoning comfort that was the result of more than just Alice’s tight hold on her. “We’d never manage it.”</p><p>They sat for a while again, Alice calculating in her head how much money she could find across her three credit cards, two debits, and the small amount of savings she had, and Rio calculating something else entirely.</p><p>“Have you spoken to Wanda? Has she left for Atlanta yet?”</p><p>“She called when she couldn’t get you. She’s okay. She’ll be on the flight now. She wanted you to know-…”</p><p>But Alice stopped talking because Rio had pulled back and was looking suddenly stricken.</p><p>“She’s fine,” she repeated quietly, watching sadly as Rio began to pull away and slip from the bed.</p><p>“I should shower and-… and then we can go.”</p><p>“Hey,” Alice said in such a firm voice that Rio actually jumped as she hovered in the entrance to the bathroom. “I’ve got you. I promise I’ve got you.”</p><p>If Rio had any more capacity for tears she might have cried again. But instead she nodded once, shot Alice what she hoped was a reassuring smile, and then disappeared into the bathroom.</p><p>Her shower look longer than usual because the heavy thud of the water over her ears felt like white noise and allowed her to not think, at least, not think the <em>worst</em> of her thoughts, even for a little while.</p><p>She wondered when her whole body had started to ache.</p><p>She wondered when Agatha had decided on the night of the dinner in London that she was going to sleep with Ralph.</p><p>But even the heavy thud of the waterfall shower couldn’t stop the worst of it for long and like the suds going down the drain, Rio began to spiral: Had Agatha known all along? Had she planned a romantic evening for her and Ralph back in their suite?</p><p>Had she seen Rio be <em>immature</em> with Nicky, sharing a milkshake with him and taking him away from the boring adult conversation at the table?</p><p>Had she been turned off by her eagerness, by her desire to please, to help, to simply <em>be</em> with Agatha?</p><p>Had she decided before or after Rio’s tongue was in her cunt.</p><p>Had she thought of Ralph when Rio told her she loved her.</p><p>Had she scurried back to him and laughed with him about the pathetic woman she’d just left on her knees.</p><p>Tormented and tragic, Rio stepped out of the warm flow of water, towel-dried her body, left her hair, and stepped back into the room.</p><p>Alice was where she’d left her on the bed. Only now she was frantically tapping away at her phone, her brow so tight she looked like she was trying to solve an algebra equation on the tiny screen.</p><p>“We’ll be early but Patrick is meeting us. We can get you looking fresh in no time. Sort that hair out.”</p><p>Rio only nodded as she moved about the room to find an outfit for the day. She didn’t get very far. Turns out a heart burnt to ash means your processing power is off, not to mention your colour-matching skills.</p><p>Alice didn’t even tease her when she moved across to silently pick for her.</p><p>She chose a cotton navy button down, a pale brown sweater, and dark jeans; inoffensive, unassuming, comfortable.</p><p>Rio changed into them silently, allowed Alice to gently brush her still wet hair, for her to apply some moisturiser to her face, and then lead them out the little house.</p><p>“I’ve not yet spoken to Jennifer about all this but after the read through will you be okay alone for a while so I-…?”</p><p>“Jennifer? She helped me last night, Alice. Don’t… it’s not her fault. Besides, I’m not a flight risk. I promise.”</p><p>Rio closed the door and turned back to lock it just as she felt a hand curl around her hip, a sudden movement back into her that told her Alice had entered guard dog mode.</p><p>She turned to see what the issue was and saw a man standing not three yards away, looking more wary than threatening, and carrying a little box with an envelope tucked beneath.</p><p>“Who the fuck are you?”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“I, uh, have a delivery for Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Then deliver it,” Alice snapped and held out her hand in a ‘gimme’ gesture. The man hesitated briefly, his wide eyes flickering to Rio before he handed the smaller woman the thing he’d been paid an exorbitant amount to deliver.</p><p>Alice snatched the two items and rather than giving them to Rio to open she shooed the man away and then opened the box herself and stared down at its contents.</p><p>“From, uh, a Mr John Smith,” the delivery man said, still unsure but backing off slowly. “Parked just up the way beside the little red car. I couldn’t get any closer. It’s… the black one.”</p><p>Rio blinked at him, wondering if he’d had some sort of stroke because of the fright Alice had just given him but he looked frightened, not delusional. She managed to nod, managed to shoot him a slight smile, and he looked grateful for the dismissal.</p><p>“John Sm-…?” Alice started with a frown as he held up the little set of keys that had been resting on a tiny black cushion in the centre of the box.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said quietly, now looking down to the thing Alice was holding up.</p><p>“She… bought you a car?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, trying to focus on <em>doing</em> rather than <em>thinking</em> and snatched the envelope from Alice’s hand. She ripped it open and all breath was stolen from her lungs as Rio stared down at the contents of the envelope. The card was cream, embossed with a small, sophisticated A.H. in the top righthand corner and written across it in loopy, elegant penmanship were two words: <em>I’m sorry.</em></p><p>The already heavy card began to feel heavier in her hands as she stared at the two words written across it.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Alice glanced at the words on the page and Rio heard her suck in a breath but it sounded distant, as if she’d dropped down into a pool and Alice were somewhere above her, looking down on her, trying to reach to pull her out.</p><p>“Come on,” she said, “let’s go. I’ll sort this out with Jen.”</p><p>Alice took her wrist as she clung to the card still in her fingers and she dragged her out to her car. The only issue was, and Alice saw this before Rio did, Alice’s little red FIAT was parked just behind a shiny new Mercedes G Wagon.</p><p>As Rio stared up at it she noticed a large bouquet of flowers just visible through the windshield sitting on the passenger side seat and Rio suddenly wanted to vomit.</p><p>“Don’t look,” Alice warned quietly, hurrying them along until she could get Rio’s door open and force her inside.</p><p>But Rio had seen enough.</p><p>In college Rio had taken a class on trauma psychology. She’d thought it was interesting more than anything else, and certainly better than the ‘statistics in the real world’ option Alice had randomly gone for: <em>“Look, the actor thing might not work out for me. I need to know numbers and shit as a backup.”</em></p><p>The class had been much more scientific than Rio had anticipated and mostly she’d quietly flirted with a pretty Psych Major in the back of the room but she’d picked up a few things: trauma is subjective, trauma can manifest psychically, trauma can create false realities, trauma can heighten the threat response.</p><p>But Rio didn’t register any of these things in her conscious mind as Alice cursed continually under her breath, as she jabbed at the screen on the dash, as the call connected to Jen and she started her car.</p><p>“Hey, she bought her a fucking car?”</p><p>“Good morning to you too, Alice.”</p><p>“Jen. I’m here with Rio now. She bought her a fucking car? What the <em>fuck</em>, Jen?”</p><p>Rio dragged her gaze away from the back of the gift before them and looked to the little screen where Jen’s name beside a little red heart sat. She counted ten seconds before she heard Jen’s voice again as Alice pulled off.</p><p>“I honestly don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Jen. There’s a great big fucking Mercedes sitting in front of us right now. “</p><p>Ten more seconds.</p><p>“Alice, I didn’t… jesus. She had locked herself in her office by the time I got back from Rio’s. I… I didn’t know.”</p><p>“Fuck. If she fucking thinks-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said quietly, shooting her friend a look and shaking her head slightly.</p><p>“Maybe let’s talk about this when we’re all together.”</p><p>“No, Jen. You kept the role switch a secret from me, you kept Agatha’s-… just <em>explain</em>.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the card now laid in her lap with Agatha’s handwriting staring back at her. She reached for it, let her fingers trace tentatively over the letters as she heard Jen release a frustrated huff.</p><p>“Look, car or no car… she’s so fucking sorry, Rio. She wants you to know-…”</p><p>“Did she plan it?” Rio said suddenly, her finger now tracing the ‘A’ of Agatha’s initial. “Had she already organised it? Before… before yesterday?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio huffed, closing her eyes as she clenched her jaw, “There’s a note here. It says ‘I’m sorry’. The car is… it’s a G Wagon and she mentioned that on our first day. I-… Jen was this all preplanned?”</p><p>This time Rio didn’t look at the seconds ticking down but she counted them in her own head and with each passing one she felt more and more faint.</p><p>“No, Rio. I mean, I… I don’t know. I don’t think so. I think she… she was hoping it wouldn’t get to this. I…  Money can help things turn around pretty quickly, you know.”</p><p>Rio felt a hand suddenly find hers and she gripped Alice like her life depended on it. Alice didn’t complain as she felt her fingers being crushed.</p><p>“A fucking <em>car</em>, Jennifer?”</p><p>“Alice, Rio, I… she’s barely functioning. She’s barely…”</p><p>Rio had released a whimper, Jen’s words the trigger to make her remember the sight of Agatha clutching her chest on the floor of their Airbnb.</p><p>Alice’s squashed fingers flexed in her own and Alice glanced at her in panic before she said to Jen through the car: “Jen, I’ll see you later, okay? We need to talk.”</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said suddenly, a little firmer than before, “Alice, I don’t want-… I mean… we’re okay?”</p><p>Rio forced her eyes open again then because this question was for Alice and Alice was there for her, crushed fingers and all, so she could at least be <em>present</em> for her. She could at least try to protect her friend’s heart when she couldn’t do the same for her own. She looked across and saw Alice working away at her jaw, she saw the pain and indecision in her best friend’s profile, she saw the white knuckles that clutched the wheel.</p><p>“Dile que la amas.” <em>Tell her you love her.</em></p><p>Because Rio knew the value in being told you were loved when the situation called for it, when it was all you needed to hear, when it wasn’t a last resort to get you to stay.</p><p>“I love you. We’re fine. We just… we need to work together. I… Jen, Rio is my priority here. Agatha can be yours but…”</p><p>“I know,” Jen said quickly, and the sound of her rushed words made Rio think that she’d been holding her breath. “I love you too. I… I’ll look after Agatha. You look after Rio. It’ll be fine.”</p><p>But something in the way Jen said those last words made Rio believe that <em>she didn’t</em> believe them. And Rio definitely didn’t either.</p><p>Jen hung up shortly after that.</p><p>The drive to the office building on sunset was large and obtrusive on the Hollywood skyline. All tall windows and white walls.</p><p>Rio and Alice got in with little fuss, some of the first to arrive due to their arrangement with Rio’s hairdresser to make her read through ready.</p><p>For Patrick, she managed to smile, managed to not look like she would rather be curled up with a fresh bottle of tequila in her hands. She made small talk and even managed to force a few laughs that sounded far from forced.</p><p>She was an Oscar Winner, after all. She could fake it once in a while. God knows she’d have to fake it when the cameras were on.</p><p>By the time her hair stylist had transformed her from a woman with wet, uneven hair to a fresh-faced starlet with a choppy bob that curled about her features in a way that looked casual but was really anything but, Rio felt even slightly more like herself.</p><p>When Patrick left them to it after making Rio promise she would never, <em>ever</em> again go at her hair with a pair of scissors, Alice finally asked the thing she’d been worried about since she’d walked in on her friend that morning.</p><p>“How’re you going to play it?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Alice had her emergency supply of products and was laying them out for Rio to peruse and use at her pleasure. She picked up a mascara and started to paint her lashes as Alice hovered by her shoulder.</p><p>“I mean with Agatha. Will you just ignore her? Because that wouldn’t look great with-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said quietly, shooting her friend a quick glance through the mirror. “I’ll be polite. I’ll say hello. Read my lines and-…”</p><p>“Hey,” Alice uttered quietly, making Rio turn to her properly this time. “I meant what I said earlier. I’ve got you. One hundred percent. I’ll speak to Jen and make sure this goes as smoothly as possible. And I’ll move in with you so that-…”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“You hate being alone. You hate being alone when you’re <em>happy</em>. I’m not leaving you alone when you’re… heartbroken.”</p><p>Rio turned away again, swallowed down the word she’d yet to use out loud. In the mirror she caught her reflection again and saw through the copious amounts of mascara she’d just applied, the blush on her high cheekbones, the soft rouge on her lips. She looked tired, unhappy, wrecked.</p><p>“I’ll get over this, right? This isn’t…” even as she was saying it she knew the answer, “this isn’t it for me?”</p><p>“No, babe.” And Alice looked conflicted too. She never was a very good actress. “It’s not.”</p><p>After gathering their things they went up to the seventeenth floor to find the room they would be holed up in for the next few hours. The building was a rabbit warren of corridors, glass-fronted office spaces, and large open plan meeting rooms.</p><p>But creatives always made themselves known.</p><p>As they stepped off the elevator they could hear the sounds of people greeting, people exclaiming, people laughing their best laughs in the hope to impress and ingratiate.</p><p>It was the same on film sets the world over. Everyone wanted to be liked. Everyone wanted to be popular with the cast and the crew alike.</p><p>Rio was usually no different. She was usually in amongst them, charming her way through the myriad conversations, through the late nights and the torturous waiting periods.</p><p>But today she just had to get through.</p><p>She had to greet everyone, smile for them, shake hands and kiss cheeks and try to remember names.</p><p>She had to not collapse when she saw Agatha.</p><p>The first person to greet her, or more like <em>envelope</em> her was Lilia. All shawls and bangles, she squeezed Rio tight to her and murmured close to her ear, “She’s here already. By the craft table.”</p><p>Rio swallowed as she pulled away but found Lilia’s hold hadn’t dropped it had simply moved to her upper arms. “Did she-…?”</p><p>“No, dear. But it’s obvious. To me at least.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only swallow again, only feel the fear begin to rise in her chest as she starved into the kind, knowing eyes of the legendary actress before her. “Deep breaths. We’re family now. You can come to me any time.”</p><p>Rio forced a smile, felt herself nod, felt Lilia squeeze her arms before she was passed off to other people to hug and force smiles at.</p><p>She landed eventually in the arms of a tall thin man she knew to be Billy Kaplan. She’d met Billy a few times and found him to be charming in a harmless, enthusiastic kind of way. And certainly now as he hugged her tight she wondered how charming this wunderkind would be after the months they’d be spending together on set.</p><p>But then again, Billy was better than Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve been <em>so</em> excited to work with you! I genuinely have been counting down the-…”</p><p>“Billy, leave the poor girl alone. She’s not even in the <em>room</em> yet.”</p><p>Lilia shot her a wink and took her hand to pull her into the room.</p><p>It was a large space, one of the few rooms Rio had seen on their journey here that didn’t have floor to ceiling windows. All white walls with colourful art on them, and with a large oblong shape made up of tables in the middle.</p><p>Along the sides sat a plethora of extra chairs, most occupied already with people Rio guessed to be managers, agents, some underlings of the producers. A lot of the spaces at the main table were already filled and Rio recognised some of her fellow cast members from simply being in Hollywood. Some were new, though, and the first person that caught her eye was the smallest in the room.</p><p>James.</p><p>Her son.</p><p>Her <em>fake</em> son.</p><p>He had dark hair, dark eyes, and Rio supposed that if you squinted and tilted your head then they looked alike. And potentially to your average movie-going public he looked exactly like her. Both with the same colouring, large eyes, Puerto Rican.</p><p>But he wasn’t her mellizo.</p><p>His mom stood up just as the little boy did and in another way Rio found him to be completely unlike Nicky: he’d <em>thrown</em> himself at her, hugging around her middle before she could even say hello. He was smaller than Nicky, a couple years younger, but it was clear he had more confidence in his pinky finger than Nicky had in his whole body.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” his mom said sweetly, trying to pry the child away from the actress. “He’s so excited to be here.”</p><p>“Oh I’m excited he’s here too.”</p><p>James pulled away and grinned a grin that wasn’t Rio’s back at her. She smiled at him, ruffled his hair, and proceeded to give the rambunctious little kid as much attention as she could until her ankles began to ache from resting back on them and she made to extricate herself from the mother and son.</p><p>People were moving around her now, hands reaching out to touch her arm in greeting or simple acknowledgement of her presence in the room. Because Rio was now one of the big stars.</p><p>She had a goddamn Oscar. A movie star smile. She had everything she, or anyone else, could ever want.</p><p>Apart from the woman currently watching her from across the room. The woman talking to the director, Maria. The woman who she’d last seen collapsed on her knees with red eyes and her hand clutching her heart.</p><p>And Rio had spotted her the moment she’d turned away from the little kid.</p><p>She’d felt that strange pull she always did to go to Agatha, to be with Agatha, to get close to Agatha.</p><p>But it was coupled with something else now: something that felt a lot like heartbreak and much like a knife in her back.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze was intense, unfaltering, even as Maria Hill - herself an Oscar nominee (tragically rare for female directors) - continued to talk at her.</p><p>Rio could see the pain in her eyes, could feel her own reflected back at her. But she couldn’t trust it anymore. She couldn’t let herself trust it.</p><p>She looked away just as another hand found her shoulder.</p><p>“Rio Vidal! What a pleasure.”</p><p>Beside her a tall blonde with kind blue eyes had appeared. A woman Rio knew to be Pepper Potts. She smiled into the hug she was offered and despite the shelter of Pepper’s warm gaze she could feel another on her from across the room.</p><p>“I’ll be your intimacy coordinator! I think we have time together Saturday morning. Maria’s very diligent about making sure everybody feels as comfortable as possible so I’ll be working with you and Agatha to make sure we build a strong foundation of trust and security. But I know you’re friends so we should already have some great groundwork laid.”</p><p>Rio could only smile, only grin inanely, only nod and accept another quick hug from Pepper as the call was made for everyone to take their seats.</p><p>Agatha being her wife as a <em>concept</em> was bad enough. But Agatha being her wife in practise on screen? In the intimate moments of any happy couple; in the touches and hand holds and kissing, that was something else entirely.</p><p>For the past week she’d started to think that maybe her body had been crafted specifically for the purpose of touching Agatha, of holding Agatha, of keeping her warm at night, of making her moan, of making her feel safe.</p><p>But her body was useless to her now.</p><p>How could she start it up again and force herself to make it do all the things it was made for when it was all just for the cameras?</p><p>Rio moved blindly with the swarm, finding that all she had to do was spot Alice to know where she was sitting. But Alice was standing behind a chair that was next to the last person on earth she wanted to be sat next to.</p><p>She shook her head no as Alice smiled sadly and pulled her seat back for her. “I’ll be right behind you.”</p><p>The words weren’t comforting. Nothing could be comforting anymore.</p><p>Because the woman who for a while was the source of her infinite comforts was now the source of her destruction.</p><p>Alice squeezed her arm as Rio lowered herself down into the chair. There were still conversations happening around the room, still a din of chatter to hide the thunderous charge of her heart.</p><p>“Did you get my note?”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze to the spread before her. There was a tall glass bottle of VOSS water, a can of Diet Coke, a pot of highlighters and pens for use on the script that lay before her with her name diagonally across the front page.</p><p>She sat uncomfortably straight, her arms framing the script, toying with the top corners of it as Agatha spoke again: “Rio, please. Can we-…?”</p><p>“I can’t,” she managed to whisper out, looking around to catch Agatha’s gaze. Her skin was clear of any visible makeup which meant Rio could see the smattering of freckles she’d loved so much she’d counted.</p><p>Her eyes were soft and tired and her lower lip, painted with a nude lipstick, was captured between her teeth.</p><p>If she’d looked like this two days ago Rio wouldn’t have been able to stop herself from kissing her, from pressing into her, from whispering the pain away with a soft “mi amor”. But that would have been then. This was now.</p><p>She inhaled slowly, saw Agatha’s gaze drop to her lips, saw the fluttering of her eyelashes as Rio murmured. “We just need to get through today.”</p><p>Two hands on both their shoulders jolted them out of the agonising moment where they simply looked at each other, and Rio felt the presence of Alice behind her suddenly even as Jen leant in to whisper between them.</p><p>“They’re taking pictures. This is a big deal. The <em>two of you doing this</em> is a big deal. Please smile, please try. Please.”</p><p>“Rio,” from her other side Alice had bent down to whisper only to her, “You can do this, okay? It’s what you’re built for.”</p><p>Rio knew Alice meant ‘acting’, hell, she may have even meant ‘being charming’, but she couldn’t have known that she was built for Agatha now, every part of her was shaped to fit a reality that was no longer available to her.</p><p>But she nodded as Alice squeezed her shoulder, as Jen did too, and then she did something she really should have won the Oscar for. She turned to Agatha and she smiled, a great big dazzling grin, and she released a laugh that sounded true, sounded perfect.</p><p>Agatha looked momentarily stricken, unsure, frozen. And Rio leant in, kissed her cheek without ever touching her lips to her, and tried not to breathe her in as she said: “Let’s just get through this. Please.”</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise as she pulled away and Rio felt her hand being taken above the table but she didn’t respond to it, ignored the whisper of her name, and pulled her hand away as Maria stood and called for order about the room.</p><p>“Welcome!! I’m so glad we’re all finally here together!”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha shift beside her, saw the way she lay her arm out parallel to Rio’s and noticed that at least Agatha hadn’t immediately put Ralph’s ring back on. That at least…</p><p>Her pale fingers were twitching.</p><p>“It’s been such a journey to get you all here today. This script has been so long in the making.”</p><p>Agatha’s left hand held something.</p><p>“God knows it’s not been easy.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help it. She’d reached for it. Her fingers closed around two of Agatha’s and gently pried her hand open until she could see what she thought she’d seen.</p><p>“I know we will all work so incredibly hard to make this movie the best it can be.”</p><p>In Agatha’s open palm, as if it had blossomed from nowhere, lay the little blue paper flower Rio had made for her all those months ago. The petals were still neat, the lines still clean and crisp. This little flower had clearly been guarded, protected, allowed to remain in perma-bloom.</p><p>“But it’s not just about the movie. Some of you are playing a family. And I know this is cliché to say but I mean it: I want this <em>set</em> to feel like a family.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers remained curled around Agatha’s pinky and ring fingers, apparently unwilling to let go as Agatha curled them down to lightly hold Rio in place.</p><p>“Some of you know each other, others are strangers, but over this rehearsal period, I want us all to really bring our a-game. To be open to new experiences and new people and to do your best to make this an exciting and comforting environment for everyone.”</p><p>Rio looked up then and saw that Agatha was watching her. This was her Agatha. The one she always was when no one else was watching. She looked cautious and tentative and Rio frowned as she saw the green of her eyes only visible when close enough to count the four freckles on her nose.</p><p>“This is going to be a celebration of love, of family, of being there for one another even in our darkest moments.”</p><p>Rio turned away, she pulled her hand back, she returned her tingling fingers to the corners of her script.</p><p>There was no amount of acting that would get her safely through the next few weeks. She would have to ignore the piece of herself that still wanted Agatha, the piece that would gladly endure the endless torture of waiting for a woman who would never be ready.</p><p>She had to get through this.</p><p>“So! A starter for ten. Can we all go round, introduce ourselves, the part we’re playing in this little gang, and a fun fact? I know, I know, juvenile, but there are a lot of people and a lot of names and it’s good to get intimate fast. I’m Maria, Director, and I have three cats and one chinchilla.”</p><p>She sat down, there was a small smattering of applause and the next person picked up - a producer. Rio began to fidget and by the time it was Agatha’s turn she’d destroyed both top corners of her script.</p><p>But she smiled, she turned politely to Agatha, she looked softly curious, she felt deathly ill.</p><p>“I’m Agatha, I’ll be playing Kate Santiago-Caldwell.”</p><p>Agatha seemed at ease, confident now, and Rio was horrified but tried not to show it when Agatha transferred the flower from her left to her right hand and leant back to drape her left arm over the back of Rio’s chair.</p><p>It was so beautifully casual, so readily done.</p><p>Agatha continued without a pause: “And my fun fact is that I’m not really a thrilled about wearing reindeer sweaters but I wanted to do this movie because I wanted to work with Rio here.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and forced a grin as she met Agatha’s gaze which remained steady, still soft even as she knew everyone was looking.</p><p>“Hard to follow that,” Rio said with a wider smile to the rest of the table that felt false but received some laughs. “I’m Rio, I’ll be playing Dani Santiago-Caldwell. I am a huge basketball fan so if I’m ever late to a call time or you’ve just lost me listen out for the sounds of a ball bouncing and you’ll usually find me.”</p><p>More laughter. Maybe Rio was going to be okay at faking it.</p><p>The spotlight moved on. Billy beside her announced himself and gave a fun fact - it soon turned out that no one really had any <em>actual</em> fun facts to share until it was the turn of the actor playing Agatha’s older brother, a prick of an actor named Peter Quill who Rio knew to be as big a sleaze as any in the industry.</p><p>He’d announced that he was once peed on by a one night stand and found he quite liked it.</p><p>So much for a comfortable, family-oriented set.</p><p>Little James had been apologised to and Maria had called quickly for order again and they swiftly moved on.</p><p>But Rio hadn’t moved on. Agatha’s arm was still around the back of her seat and she didn’t know why Agatha hadn’t yet removed it.</p><p>Was it comforting to her? Having Rio close? She knew it used to be. She knew she stole her clothes in order to feel close even when she wasn’t there but this… did she think she was comforting <em>Rio</em>?</p><p>By the time everyone had looped back around to Maria - Maria had insisted upon including the other people around the room, the non-cast, non-producer types - an hour had past. And Agatha was still holding her chair.</p><p>Fresh coffees and juices started to be handed around upon one of the producer’s insistence and Rio found that only then did Agatha pull her arm back. And in the absence of it Rio realised something gut-wrenching.</p><p>Whether or not Agatha had put her arm there for Rio’s comfort, it <em>had</em> been comforting.</p><p>And now she was alone again, her fingers wrapped around a hot mug of coffee as she turned to speak to Billy by her left side and asked him if he really had seen Lady Gaga seven times in concert.</p><p>Time moved slowly from then on. Agatha didn’t return her arm to Rio’s chair. In fact, the only words they now exchanged were the words of their characters as the read through began.</p><p>It was harder than Rio had imagined, hearing Maria read out the stage directions that told of the touches between the two wives, the hand holding, the kisses. Everything felt like a threat, felt ominous, felt insurmountable.</p><p>She knew behind her that Alice’s eyes were boring into her head but it didn’t help to know she was there. It didn’t help that Agatha was occasionally bumping their knuckles together as they read their lines, it helped even less when Rio removed her hand entirely from the table so she couldn’t do it anymore.</p><p>Nothing helped. Nothing ever would.</p><p>Rio’s character was in almost every scene Agatha’s was. If she wasn’t speaking, she was leaning against the counter, holding Agatha against her. If she was sitting on the couch she was either tangled up in Agatha and her son or she was simply nearby, watching Agatha with the love described in the words on the page.</p><p>There was mistletoe.</p><p>There were soft declarations of support and love.</p><p>It was all too much to comprehend.</p><p>Rio disappeared into her fantasies in order to get through. Her ‘what ifs’. What if Agatha hadn’t slept with Ralph? What if she’d told her she loved her the moment she started to feel it, if she ever <em>actually</em> felt it?</p><p>What if Rio could reach over now and find Agatha’s hand resting patiently on her thigh for her to hold?</p><p>What if the thought of touching her, kissing her, lying in bed with her, didn’t make her feel like she wanted to die?</p><p>They broke for lunch.</p><p>Rio moved faster than she ever thought possible. She sequestered herself in with a group of other actors by the table full of hot and cold food. She kept her back to the room. She spoke when spoken to and smiled the whole time.</p><p>Alice disappeared to take a phone call only when she knew Rio was protected on all sides by an unknowing but willing blockade. People wanted to be near Rio - they just didn’t know they were also providing a protection service.</p><p>But Alice wasn’t long. When she came back she had a hold of her arm, she kept her grounded, acted as Rio knew she would as the best guard between her and the prospect of Agatha approaching.</p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p>Perhaps Rio bolting had been enough for her to understand that now wasn’t the time to talk. In any case, Rio didn’t look around to see how far away she was.</p><p>Billy seemed to have latched on to Rio at some point during the break for lunch. It turned out that he was thoughtful and observant as well as eager to please and genuinely quite sweet.</p><p>“What was that in Agatha’s hand?”</p><p>“What?” Rio felt Alice move a little closer, her hold on her arm dropping to her elbow.</p><p>“It looked like a fidget toy or something but then I thought, no! Agatha Harkness doesn’t have ADHD or anxiety or, like, any kind of mental health <em>thing</em>.”</p><p>“Not unless being a b-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio insisted quickly, jerking her arm out so Alice’s hold fell from it and she shut up, “it’s just a flower. Origami, I mean. Just… I don’t know why she had it.”</p><p>She felt Alice take her arm back again and she inhaled slowly, trying desperately not to think about the matching flower she had that sat pride of place on her nightstand. Nicky’s flower.</p><p>“Weird,” Billy said with raised brows as he turned to look over Rio’s shoulder at where Rio assumed Agatha to be. She hoped she wasn’t close.</p><p>“Ah, my children.” A hand on her side told her that Lilia had arrived and Rio relaxed just a little, now even more sandwiched in amongst the bodies of people who <em>weren’t</em> Agatha.</p><p>“Are we all having fun? Getting along?”</p><p>“Sure thing,” Rio reassured with an easy smile that she didn’t think Lilia quite bought. She felt her squeeze her side. “Have you spoken much to your wife? She’s over there with little James. He seems quite fond.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and in an attempt to look like looking at Agatha wasn’t the hardest thing in the world she turned around to see her crouched down on the floor, her hands held out as she played pat-a-cake with the enthusiastic little boy. If Rio squinted, with James’ back to her, it could almost have been Agatha and a younger Nicky.</p><p>Agatha looked up and caught Rio staring and she smiled hopefully as Lilia beside her said: “Why don’t you go get to know the boy? Bond as a family.” She lifted her hand up to briefly touch Rio’s hair and Rio raised her brows as she looked around at the old woman, seeing something close to mischief in her eyes.</p><p>“It’s a shame they couldn’t get Agatha’s.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well…” Lilia glanced at Billy and smiled kindly but then moved herself and Rio away from him, leading her into the more empty portion of the room. She lowered her voice, and Rio leant down to listen, “Part of Agatha’s deal negotiation involved talk around getting him involved. The studio,” Lilia cleared her throat as they moved past Pepper, “<em>Stark</em> was insistent she let them hire him due, mostly, to his being <em>her</em> actual son and looking exactly like your… twin.”</p><p>Rio looked up into Lilia’s dark gaze and raised her brows, “She said no.”</p><p>“Of course. The little boy is too shy anyway but… Agatha is well aware of the cost of all eyes being on her so she wouldn’t allow that for Nicholas either.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio corrected gently, the corner of her lip twitching involuntarily. “He goes by Nicky.”</p><p>“Nicky. And if I’m correct then the next few months she’s going to want to keep things as close to her chest as possible, the people she loves as protected as possible, you understand.”</p><p>Rio didn’t understand. How could she?</p><p>She instinctually pulled from Lilia’s hold. She blinked at her as Lilia frowned and looked down her nose at her, and Rio felt scrutinised in a way she didn’t like suddenly, in a way that triggered her anxiety even more than anything else that day.</p><p>“How do you know all this?”</p><p>Just as she took in an audible, sharp breath that cut her throat Lilia placed her hand delicately on Rio’s forearm. “People talk, you should know that. <em>Agatha</em> is of particular interest to the-…”</p><p>“Lilia,” Alice had joined them, her hand gently prying Lilia’s from Rio’s arm, “I think Rio-..”</p><p>“No, Lilia. What were you going to say?”</p><p>Rio gripped Lilia’s shawl about her arm and Lilia smiled so that Rio would feel placated but she felt anything but.</p><p>“Let’s go see your family, shall we?”</p><p>And despite feeling like she’d been forced to swallow a thousand knives, she obliged. Who could say no to Lilia Calderu with her decades of experiences and strange influence? Rio nodded, felt Alice’s gentle encouragement behind her move her along with Lilia. And Rio turned to look at their destination.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Agatha with the blue green eyes that pulled her in and drowned her every time. Agatha with the soft touches and open smiles.</p><p>Rio fell to her knees beside her without really thinking and James was pleased to have her there. So pleased in fact that he was back on his feet, his hands in Rio’s hair, and Rio almost recoiled but she allowed it and smiled because this was a child and he didn’t know any better.</p><p>He couldn’t know another little boy across the city had cut her hair, perhaps less neatly than it currently looked, but she’d allowed him to because she had wanted to protect him, to see him and his mother smile.</p><p>“You wanna show Rio what we just learnt?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>James held up his hands and Rio settled onto the floor properly to let him play pat-a-cake with her. She felt Agatha settle close and was aware of an onset photographer circling nearby but she was grateful that Agatha didn’t push it. She didn’t lean in. She didn’t wrap her arms around Rio or rest her chin on her shoulder or brush her hair behind her ear.</p><p>But she found herself wanting Agatha to do all those things.</p><p>As she clapped the game with James she wondered how long it would take her mind, her body, to not crave Agatha. “Forever” echoed in her brain. “Forever” echoed in her bones. It flexed its syllables in her muscles, and she wondered whether it were true or whether it was a result of her immaturity, the immaturity Agatha had accused her of.</p><p>Either way, she soon became distracted by their new, fake son.</p><p>It turned out James was indefatigable. He kept going and going and going and what Rio had heard through the grapevine about this child actor had been true. He was full of energy, curious, bold, and much too sure of himself to be an easy kid to work with.</p><p>But Agatha had a way with him.</p><p>She was calm with him where Rio kept finding that everything she said or did he would take as fuel to his fire.</p><p>Rio could only watch, only pretend not to pine for the woman who calmed the boy with a gentle word or a soft promise, and soon James was back with his actual mom and Agatha and Rio were lifting to their feet.</p><p>Agatha stood first, fastest, and Rio couldn’t help but wonder if she’d hurried up in order to be able to turn around and offer a hand to Rio.</p><p>She couldn’t refuse it so she ignored it instead. Only when Rio was on her feet she locked eyes with Agatha and smiled slightly, feeling her throat tighten when she realised they were effectively alone again.</p><p>“Did… did you like it?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, bit down on the corner of her lip, checked no one was looking and saw only Alice and Jen keeping a close eye. She sighed quietly. “Like what?”</p><p>Agatha looked pained all of a sudden, when for a flickering second Rio had thought she'd almost looked hopeful as her eyes darted about Rio’s face. “The car. Did he get to you before you left?”</p><p>Rio looked down at her feet. “I got the car, Agatha.”</p><p>“I… you… are we okay?” Agatha Harkness stepped closer and Rio realised something, something she hadn’t before.</p><p>The great, the talented, the world-famous Agatha Harkness was in fact just a teenager giving her crush a rose in the hopes they’d forgive a silly joke poorly told in homeroom.</p><p>The only difference was in this case Agatha was a millionaire with a stunted view of how relationships were fixed.</p><p>But the concept was the same; like hoping a leaking boat will take you home, tied together with ribbon and a prayer.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio insisted quietly, betraying herself by matching Agatha’s movement and taking a step closer too. “That’s not how… a car can’t fix this.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her and Rio knew she’d guessed right. Every cell, every <em>atom</em> of her yearned for the Agatha that looked at her now. So confused, so unsure, so desperate, that Rio wanted to just say all was forgiven and they could pick back up where they left off.</p><p>But she was her father’s daughter. She had his heart and she had her mother’s sense to try and protect it.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said quietly, appearing just in time to save Rio from herself.</p><p>“Let’s grab a coffee and sit back down.”</p><p>Jen appeared at Agatha’s side too and the woman she was when she was with Rio disappeared into the actress she had to be today. The whiplash was extreme. Any sense of actual contrition, any desperation from Agatha disappeared and suddenly Rio was hit with the uncertainty of Agatha’s true feelings, as her soft Agatha disappeared with a pursing of her lips, a tension in her jaw, a hardening of her blue eyes.</p><p>Alice’s hold on her was fierce, and Rio could feel how angry her friend was simply by the strength of her hand on her arm. But now wasn’t the time to say anything. She caught Jen’s eye as they walked past and saw that she too looked furious and she knew then that perhaps the shockwaves of the fallout between her and Agatha would destroy more than just the home they’d created in each other.</p><p>Coffee was hard to come by when people wanted your attention. Rio dodged stupid jokes about it being Christmas “so early this year!”, she hugged producers she’d met but didn’t know the names of, she chatted to one of the writers about characterisation and backstory. But mostly she thought of the woman who’d disappeared from the room with her manager.</p><p>She thought of the car that had been a joke between them a week ago and now was a representation of everything they could have had, everything that would never be. And apparently the gas-guzzling bandaid Agatha had thought would fix everything between them.</p><p>Eventually everyone took their seats but there was a suspicious gap in the table and Rio kept her gaze down, pretending she was diligently highlighting her lines.</p><p>Maria asked if a runner could go and find Agatha and ten minutes later she appeared back in the room. Rio didn’t look up as she sat beside her. She didn’t say anything as she reached her hand out for the flower that lay just an inch away from Rio’s water bottle.</p><p>She didn’t say anything when Agatha began to toy with it in her delicate fingers again.</p><p>She said nothing when Agatha whispered a quiet: “Can we talk?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else that wasn’t her lines after that. They fell into a rhythm and it was clear to everyone at the table - including Rio - just what a get Agatha Harkness was.</p><p>She simply read the lines like everybody else. But she changed them, she adjusted her way of speaking. Her voice lowered to a different register, barely perceptible to anyone who either didn’t know Agatha or who wasn’t intimately involved in the craft of acting.</p><p>And the room might not have known Agatha as well as Rio did, but they knew acting. They knew <em>good</em> acting. And this was it. Agatha was good. Agatha was the best of them.</p><p>And she was barley trying.</p><p>There was a call to pause before a scene Rio knew was coming up that would be one of the hardest to film because of the subject of it, the intimacy of it. She reached for her bottle and knocked back her water just for a way to clear her suddenly tight throat.</p><p>Agatha beside her was tapping gently at the table and she didn’t know whether it was impatience or nerves that fuelled her as Maria demanded attention again.</p><p>“I think, yes. James, Marie, thank you so much for your time today. I’ll see you again tomorrow for costume fittings.”</p><p>She gestured to someone at the edge of the room and Rio looked up as the same runner who’d gone to find Agatha jumped to her feet to go and escort little James and his mom. The room applauded as they said their goodbyes and James beamed his confident grin and waved enthusiastically at Agatha and Rio and then bounced off with his mom.</p><p>God bless child labour laws, Rio thought to herself as she turned back to Maria.</p><p>“Okay, any of James’ lines can be read by,” she scanned the room for a victim, “Susan. Thanks so much.”</p><p>Rio saw this Susan blush a deep red and she felt a little sorry for her as she moved over to take James’ empty seat at the table.</p><p>She looked back down to her script again as Maria cleared her throat and read: “It’s dark in Kate’s old room. The room is still, quiet apart from Luca’s soft breathing. Dani enters and stops to smile at the sight. Kate is curled around their son, awake, but barely so.”</p><p>Rio took a breath, tried to pretend Agatha’s hand wasn’t suddenly just centimetres from her own, that when she’d placed it there the knuckle of her left ring finger hadn’t swiped across her skin.</p><p>“He’s nice like this,” she read, falling into the stage whisper she’d need for the scene.</p><p>“Too like his mama to be nice when awake,” Agatha uttered beside her, her voice equally soft.</p><p>“Dani rolls her eyes and moves to the side of the bed.”</p><p>“Room for one more?”</p><p>“You’ll wake him.”</p><p>“Dani just smiles and carefully slips into the bed, practised as she is at joining her family after a long day. She leans up on her elbow behind her wife.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“It’s been a long day.”</p><p>Agatha’s finger twitched and Rio closed her eyes as it grazed the back of her own.</p><p>“Dani leans over, brushes the hair back from Kate’s face.”</p><p>Rio exhaled quietly and said: “We should have another.”</p><p>Agatha’s finger twitched again and Rio felt her heart swell impossibly in her chest. They were touching properly now, neither had pulled away.</p><p>“You want another baby with me?”</p><p>“Well, this bed can fit at least another two, don’t you think?”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip as Maria read: “Kate smiles, rolls her eyes, shifts back to look up at Dani.”</p><p>“Two?”</p><p>“You don’t want to be outnumbered by crazy kids?”</p><p>“Kate lifts her hand from under the sheets and for a moment looks wistful. She touches Dani’s face.”</p><p>Agatha’s finger twitched against her own and as she spoke her next line Rio moved her hand away: “Only if they look like you.”</p><p>Agatha’s decision to make them wives, Christmas wives, <em>fake</em> wives, was suddenly cruel. It was beyond cruel. It was unforgivable.</p><p>These lines with Wanda would have been sweet, tinged with a little guilt that Wanda might still be harbouring a crush, but harmless for the most part. But with Agatha? With Agatha they were loaded, the gun cocked, the muzzle aimed directly at Rio’s heart.</p><p>“Dani smiles and leans in to kiss Kate.”</p><p>Rio stared at her line. She stared and stared until: “Rio?”</p><p>Maria had broken the scene to nudge Rio into action but Rio couldn’t bring herself to say it. She couldn’t bring herself to read the three words on the page. The three words that meant her heart was in pieces in her chest.</p><p>The three words that…</p><p>“Yo también te amo, cariño.” <em>I love you too, honey.</em></p><p>Rio looked around at Agatha, saw that she was staring determinedly down at her own script, at the words of the line she’d just read that were written in English.</p><p>“Nice,” Maria complimented the surprise translation with a smile on her face. “They kiss again and Dani settles down behind her wife, reaching to envelope their son in her arms too.”</p><p>Rio was still staring at the words Agatha had translated for the whole room to hear, feeling the heat rise in her cheeks and the blood rush to her head.</p><p>Beneath the table Agatha nudged her knee.</p><p>She jumped, cleared her throat, felt the eyes of the room on her when she read: “We should talk about your mom.”</p><p>“There’s nothing to talk about.”</p><p>“Kate turns away properly and Dani follows the movements of her body. Kate is the sun, Dani stuck happily in her orbit. She pulls her arm back, and below the sheets she holds Kate even closer. Kate closes her eyes.”</p><p>“So… this baby thing?”</p><p>“Kate laughs.”</p><p>“Can we talk about it once we’re back home?”</p><p>“Mm’kay. Until then I’ll just think about you all cute and soft and pregnant.”</p><p>“Call me soft again and you’re not getting a-…”</p><p>“Hot and beautiful.”</p><p>“Kate turns and Dani shifts up to look at her again.”</p><p>“Do you think Evan was right?”</p><p>“Kate reaches for her wife, Dani leans into her touch and takes a second to respond.”</p><p>“No, babe. He’s just bitter because he’s a divorced prick stuck in-…”</p><p>“I’m serious.”</p><p>“So am I. You’re an amazing mother and an amazing daughter.”</p><p>“And wife?”</p><p>“Dani smiles, a great big cheesy grin that Kate catches with a wry look in her eyes.”</p><p>Rio somehow ripped the script she had been gripping tightly. “<em>My</em> wife is the best wife in the world. And we’ll get through these next few days together, okay?”</p><p>“Kate nods, her smile fading slowly as Dani kisses the hand still holding her face.”</p><p>“No podría hacerlo sin ti.” <em>I couldn’t do it without you.</em></p><p>Rio stared at the purely English script, ripped the edge a little more, sucked in a breath.</p><p>“They kiss again, slower this time, and Kate sheds a tear but tries to hide it as she pulls away. Dani notices and as Kate turns she presses in behind her, holding her closer than before.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, took just a second before she finally followed Agatha into her mother tongue: “Te adoro. Adoro lo que tenemos.” <em>I adore you. I adore what we have.</em></p><p>“Kate closes her eyes, Dani presses in again. They fall asleep entangled as a family. End scene.”</p><p>Rio looked up from where she’d been staring at the word “love” on her page, unsure why she’d substituted it with “adore”, unsure why she was still ripping her script, unsure why the words on the page that she’d read before now hurt her so exquisitely it was like they’d been written across her skin with a blade.</p><p>“Incredible, ladies. Really. We’re so lucky to have you both and the <em>chemistry</em>. I mean…”</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha shift beside her and wondered where her previous bravado had gone. She hadn’t thrown her arm about her chair again.</p><p>There were more murmurs of “chemistry” and even a whoop from Billy that made Rio want to stab him in the ribs. But they’d moved on swifter than Rio feared they might.</p><p>The rest of the read was just as painful.</p><p>Kate and Dani were in almost every scene together and when Dani wasn’t with her wife she was <em>talking</em> about her wife.</p><p>Everything was Kate.</p><p>Everything was Agatha.</p><p>Rio had played the girlfriend roles before. She’d played a wife or two. But none of them were characters she envied - certainly not for who they were with.</p><p>But she found in the character of Daniela Santiago-Caldwell a deep connection through the lens of a woman who loved deeply, protected fiercely, and treasured the little family she had.</p><p>But Rio didn’t have that third thing.</p><p>A hand on her shoulder as the read through came to an end and the room erupted with applause shocked her back into her body.</p><p>“Babe, let’s go.”</p><p>Rio moved with the help of Alice pulling her chair out and was just turning to her when a hand on her wrist stopped her. Agatha stood slowly, her gentle fingers like spines poking through Rio’s skin, injecting her with the poison that turned her blood to liquid fire.</p><p>“Rio, can-…?”</p><p>“Rio! We haven’t had a chance to catch up!”</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her dropped and Rio found herself missing it immediately, as masochistic as she knew that to be. She turned to a smiling Maria and smiled too, accepting the hug that she offered.</p><p>“That Spanish turn, by the way. I’d like to get that in as much as possible. Little words, little phrases, you know. Anything that adds to the delicious chemistry you have.”</p><p>Rio watched as their director grinned at the two of them, oblivious and loving it.</p><p>Agatha just smiled, threw her head back and shook out her hair. The bravado was back. She was Agatha the movie star again and Rio was just numb.</p><p>“Thought it would highlight the love there. They’re alone. Why wouldn’t Kate speak to Dani in the language she knows her wife to associate with comfort and love? ¿Cierto, Rio?” <em>Right, Rio?</em></p><p>Rio nodded stiffly, her smile now frozen in place, her eyes trained on Maria rather than the woman now watching her from just a foot away.</p><p>“It certainly did,” Maria agreed, and it became clear that despite her own pedigree, she was dazzled by Agatha just as much as anyone else in the room was. “Seeing you both during awards season too… I was so happy with the change when the higher ups told me it was even a possibility you might take over from Wanda.”</p><p>Rio’s smile dropped, her body suddenly felt tense even as soft fingers found her wrist again, began to dance over the sensitive skin there.</p><p>“Wanda would have been an excellent choice too,” she said as calmly as she could, suddenly aware that Jen had moved closer and Alice was now holding her sleeve.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong,” Maria laughed out, “I’m pretty sure you could have chemistry with a lamp post but…” she gestured between the two of them and Rio pulled her wrist from Agatha, “it’s palpable. And I know the internet is already wild for you both.”</p><p>Agatha tried again, this time Rio felt her knuckles against her hip and she knew she’d hooked her fingers into her belt loop.</p><p>“We’ll give them something to go wild for,” Rio managed to force out, making her face form that easy smile again even as she felt sick suddenly, trapped by pale fingers and a traitorous heart.</p><p>Maria beamed and made her excuses before she kissed both Rio and Agatha, said a cursory goodbye to their managers and the four women were left alone.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, and Agatha moved in, her blue eyes suddenly directly in front of her, her left hand now mirroring the position of her right. She’d tethered herself to Rio and Rio didn’t have the strength to push her away.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice warned darkly before Agatha, who’s mouth had opened to say something, was able to tell Rio what she wanted to tell her. “Rio and I are leaving.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen added softly, touching Agatha’s arm.</p><p>“Please, my love.”</p><p>Rio had never know a pain like it. Far from the agony of being left on her knees, a million times more torturous than knowing Agatha had slept with her husband and thought she was immature - a coward - hearing her call her “my love” felt like having her heart split in two with a subtle knife.</p><p>Soft in its eagerness to pry her open, gently slicing through the already battered and bruised root of her being, it felt like it cut through her deeper than any betrayal she could bear to name.</p><p>Alice was moving where she couldn’t. Alice was trying to gently pry the fingers of Agatha’s right hand from where they held fast to her without causing a scene. Alice was whispering, “don’t, no, don’t.”</p><p>But Rio found her voice, shaky and unsure as it was: “I can’t do this, Agatha. Please. Please don’t do this.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen tried.</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice tried too.</p><p>But Agatha only moved again, only dropped her hold when Rio did something that neither of them was expecting. Rio stepped into her, held her cheek, kissed her other properly this time, and as easy as breathing Agatha released her and Rio stepped around her and made her way quickly from the room.</p><p>The memory of Agatha’s skin against her lips made her breathless as she smiled and waved and hugged her way back out of the building.</p><p>She didn’t breathe again until she was in the front seat of Alice’s car. Alice didn’t say anything but she drove away fast, and for that Rio was thankful.</p><p>Without thinking she stole Alice’s phone from the centre console and tapped until she had it to her ear. There was time enough for one dial tone before she heard a voice.</p><p>“Hey. I’ve been trying to call Rio but-…”</p><p>“It’s me. Hey.”</p><p>There was a breath. And then both spoke simultaneously.</p><p>“Did you know?” “I had no idea.”</p><p>Rio laughed, and the sensation was alien but felt a little like relief.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“Are you kidding? It’s <em>freezing</em> here. There’s actual snow on the ground.”</p><p>“<em>Wanda</em>, are you okay?”</p><p>Wanda sighed and Rio chewed on her lip, feeling the relief she’d briefly experienced disappear.</p><p>“I’m hurt. I’m upset. I’m disappointed. Honestly, I’m a little angry. Alice called me a few hours ago and told me what she’d done.”</p><p>“Are you angry with me?”</p><p>“No. Only with Agatha.”</p><p>Rio nodded and closed her eyes as she felt Alice’s hand settle on her leg. “Me too.”</p><p>“Yeah? You’re not <em>thrilled</em> she’s your wife?”</p><p>“No, I… it’s complicated.”</p><p>“What’s happened?”</p><p>“Nothing. I… It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Hey, remember it’s just business. I’m pissed but… the movie with Agatha will be… god she’ll elevate it beyond anything I could do with it. Besides, they went to her first, right?”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“I’m stuck here for a while but, would be good to see you soon?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Sorry, I’m just… it’s been a bad couple days.”</p><p>“Tell me about it.”</p><p>As Wanda laughed Rio found herself smiling just a little, “I’ll call you soon, okay? Keep warm.”</p><p>“Rio. Wait. Did… you didn’t know?”</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>“I know I just… know how much you like her.”</p><p>“She did this behind my back.”</p><p>In the silence Rio wondered what Wanda was doing, how she was <em>actually</em> feeling. But she didn’t have the capacity to take on anyone else’s hurt.</p><p>“I’ll call soon, okay? Or I’ll call Alice. I know how hard you are to get ahold of. But it would be good to see you soon.”</p><p>“You too. Bye, Wands.”</p><p>Rio hung up and replaced Alice’s phone back in the cup holder where she’d stolen it from.</p><p>“You told her what she did?”</p><p>“Yeah, sorry. When she called again earlier to speak to you I was pissed and you were in the middle of the read through and….”</p><p>“It’s fine. She deserves to know.”</p><p>“How’re you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I want to die.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’ll smile, be friendly, professional. I just… when I look at her I forgive her.”</p><p>Alice was silent for a while before she said: “Jen says she’s still a mess. She’s gone practically nonverbal unless Nicky’s there.”</p><p>Rio turned her head to look out the window.</p><p>“Where did they go? Earlier? When she was late back?”</p><p>“She holed herself up in a bathroom… I think…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Jen said she was vomiting.”</p><p>Rio screwed her eyes more tightly shut, twisting her fingers in her lap, still able to feel the ghost of Agatha’s knuckles against them.</p><p>“It’ll get easier. I promise. I’ll be around all the time, okay? I won’t let you be alone with her.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only hope Alice knew she was thankful for her. The hand on her leg soon found her arm and Alice’s slim fingers were soon entwined with her own, filling the spaces that belonged to the woman with the hair as wild as the ocean of her eyes.</p><p>In silence they sped back to Rio’s little home in the hills. Rio’s heart, mutilated and aching, reminded her with every dull thud in her chest that she’d lost something she could never get back.</p><p>“Get rid of it,” were the first words she said to her friend when they arrived back at her house. The brand new Mercedes sat, untouched and offensive, a physical reminder of what she’d had and of what Agatha had done.</p><p>Alice only nodded, only tapped away at her phone as Rio led them inside.</p><p>The house was quiet and Rio simply disappeared up the stairs, stripped down to her underwear, and crawled into bed.</p><p>Sleep doesn’t come easy when mental pain manifests itself as an obtrusive ache that could be felt deep within Rio’s bones. She managed it only after what felt like an age of tossing and turning.</p><p>Beside her in the bed Alice had curled up around midnight to keep her company so she could have someone to wake to in the dark, lonely hours of the night.</p><p>And when they woke they woke together. They got ready in silence, with dark eyes watching Rio’s every move, Alice’s small hands close by to take Rio’s shaking ones as she drank her morning coffee and thought on the day ahead.</p><p>A day of figuring out how her character would dress; what a woman with a loving wife and a happy child would wear in her day to day life.</p><p>Every thought was on Agatha as Rio opened her front door that morning and as if the universe, cruel and unfeeling as it was, could hear her thoughts, she saw what had been left for her on her doorstep.</p><p>Sitting patiently for her to find it was her familiar leather duffel and on top a large Tupperware which in turn had a note sat above it.</p><p>Alice gathered the three things before Rio had a chance to.</p><p>The door was closed again.</p><p>Alice read the note as Rio opened her bag and saw all of her clothes folded neatly, the soft scent of Agatha’s laundry detergent filling her ravenous lungs the moment she’d pulled back the zipper.</p><p>She searched in it, looking for the one shirt she knew Agatha had but had never admitted to taking. It wasn’t there.</p><p>She closed the bag again, unable to breathe that delicious scent in without feeling dizzy with it, without craving more of it, wanting to swim in it or allow herself to drown.</p><p>Alice was still staring down at the note but Rio needed more time before she looked at it.</p><p>She turned her attention to the large Tupperware and saw a dozen perfect empanadas. Homemade. And if Rio were to guess she’d guess they had been made to her mom’s recipe.</p><p>Her stomach churned as she imagined Agatha, late last night, standing in her kitchen, making Rio something delicious, something personal, something full of care and love.</p><p>“Do you want to read it?”</p><p>Rio jumped and turned to Alice now holding out the note and with a shaking hand she took it from her.</p><p>In Agatha’s looping script she’d written: “Debería habértelo dicho antes. Por favor, déjame explicarte. Por favor, háblame. Te amo. Lo siento.” <em>I should have told you earlier. Please let me explain. Please talk to me. I love you. I'm sorry.</em></p><p>Rio crumpled the note in her fist and for a second was silent before she said: “How am I going to get through this, Alice?”</p>

<p><em>Rio crumpled the note in her fist and for a second was silent before she said: “How am I going to get through this, Alice?”</em></p><p>“With time, okay? One day at a time.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only allow Alice to take her hand and steer her back out the door and away to set.</p><p>Agatha had to have dropped it off. She had to have been at her house, had to have driven there, had to have left Rio’s things for her with the note, with the empanadas, and decided not to knock for her.</p><p>She supposed she could be grateful for at least that.</p><p>But she couldn’t feel grateful for anything else.</p><p>There was a whole day ahead of her where she had to be smiley, had to be friendly and not tell everybody that she could barely breathe without it hurting, without wanting to just turn to Alice and say “fuck it” and find Agatha and let her destroy her some more.</p><p>Outside in the cool air between winter and early spring, Rio saw the space where Agatha’s first apology had been parked. She wondered where it had gone: if Alice had returned it to sender or if it were sitting unaccepted in some garage in downtown LA.</p><p>They drove in silence, with Alice’s hand occasionally twitching across to squeeze Rio’s fidgeting ones before landing back again on the wheel.</p><p>Rio’s mind was elsewhere again, back in the Airbnb, back watching Agatha breakdown, lash out, and breakdown again. But yesterday she’d been so tentative, so desperate, that she couldn’t get a hold on how she felt about it.</p><p>The overriding feeling was hurt.</p><p>But she was also angry, also confused, also unbelievably horrified that the woman she’d thought had feelings for her, who now was constantly claiming to love her, had fallen back into her husband’s arms the moment anything had become too real.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, a woman who was so in control, was so stroic, so put-together, didn’t have a handle on her own heart.</p><p>And so Rio Vidal, Delawarean, Celtics fan, showoff and party girl, stood no chance.</p><p>They arrived a little after nine in the morning to a quite set full of white trailers with signs on the doors that read ‘Costume A’, ‘Costume B’, ‘Director: Maria Hill’, and so on as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Rio supposed her own trailer must be in there somewhere but she didn’t have time to go and find it as Alice tugged her to ‘Costume B’ and they both stood back after she knocked on the door.</p><p>It was flung open suddenly and a woman in dungarees and a wide smile appeared before them. “Rio! And you must be Alice! Come in, come in.”</p><p>Rio smiled as much as she could and stepped in first and found herself enveloped suddenly, and without warning. “I’m Stevie. This,” Stevie pulled away to motion to the other woman just waiting to get her claws in Rio, “this is Frankie. Or Frank, whoever tickles your pickle.”</p><p>Turned out: Stevie and Frankie were exactly what she needed.</p><p>They were like two puppy dogs, bouncing about the place just thrilled to be there and thrilled to be dressing Rio Vidal.</p><p>The trailer was warm, there were snacks and drinks on the side, music playing in the background, and enough chatter that Rio immediately knew her thoughts would be blissfully drowned out as the day went on.</p><p>It was often the case that the costume department was the best place to hang out on set - second on to craft services - and seemingly that was going to be true again.</p><p>Stevie had hugged her twice within the first five minutes because she “couldn’t remember if I’ve already hugged you?” and Rio had already been convinced to have a coffee and a pastry which was more food than she’d consumed in two days.</p><p>Alice settled into the corner of the couch and for once took her eyes off of Rio and allowed her to be manhandled by the chatty wardrobe team who went back over her measurements they already had scribbled down.</p><p>“Tiny,” Frankie announced as she pulled the measuring tape from around Rio’s waist, “long limbs, though. Should be an athlete or something.”</p><p>“Well, I-…</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em> get her started,” Alice warned from her position on the couch.</p><p>“Oh? I know you’re a Nicks fan. See you at the games all the time.”</p><p>“Celtics,” Rio corrected with a raised brow as Stevie moved back over to measure her bust, “Don’t insult me.”</p><p>Frankie only laughed and dropped down to measure her inseam. “Agatha is too? I’ll never forget the day those pictures went viral. My sister and her wife went fucking <em>nuts</em> over it.”</p><p>Rio shot Alice a look, but managed to maintain her cool as Stevie shuffled back over to scribble down the confirmation of Rio’s measurements.</p><p>“Made worse of course by the fact that kid of Agatha’s actually looks like <em>your</em> kid. It’s none of my business but I assume she got a sperm donor? That husband of hers looks nothing like him.”</p><p>Rio felt like someone had poured glue into her mouth, unable as she was to open it to deny this query to confirm that Nicky was Ralph’s, that neither she, nor anyone else had anything to do with it.</p><p>But Alice spoke for her, “He’s their kid. Though even I thought for a while that Rio had secretly given birth to him and just never mentioned it.”</p><p>Rio had enough brain power left to shoot Alice an exasperated look, one that was ignored and returned with a grin.</p><p>“He’s just got dark hair and dark eyes, that’s all.”</p><p>“No, seriously,” Frankie now said from her knees in front of Rio. “It’s uncanny. I was hoping we’d get him on the movie but we got James instead. Boy is he a live wire. Would barely sit still last week for his fitting.”</p><p>“Agatha has a way with him,” Alice said from the couch, making Rio shoot another look across at her.</p><p>“Well I guess she’s a mom. Knows how to speak to kids to get them to shut the hell up and sit down. Must do it on the daily.”</p><p>Rio felt a sudden flame ignite in her chest, a strange indignant spark at the mere suggestion that Nicky would be anything other than perfect. And before she could stop herself she was defending him: “Actually Nicky doesn’t need that. He doesn’t have meltdowns, he doesn’t have tantrums. He’s a good kid.”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Frankie looked up at her with a grin, “trust me, every kid has their limit. Every kid has tantrums. Maybe Nicky hasn’t had one around you yet but…”</p><p>“Oh he will,” sang Stevie as she came back over and shoved another pastry in Rio’s hand, “James had two whilst we were with him. Hates the colour green, apparently. Wouldn’t wear the green reindeer sweater we had knit especially for him.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered and in lieu of saying anything else or defending a child she probably wouldn’t get to see again, she shoved the corner of the pain au chocolat in her mouth.</p><p>The morning went by pretty quickly after that, with Rio constantly in varying stages of undress for the most part. But her body being moved constantly, clothes being thrown on and off, occasionally having the curtain thrown around her in the makeshift changing space by Alice when all that was left of her clothes were her bra and underwear, it all made everything feel that little bit better.</p><p>Or, maybe not better, but <em>normal</em>.</p><p>Around midday when Rio had forced half a baguette down her throat, washed down swiftly by some strong coffee, Alice had had enough of seeing her friend’s tits.</p><p>“Just fucking put it on,” she insisted as Frankie and Stevie exchanged looks where Rio now stood in dark grey joggers and her from-home bra.</p><p>“Do my tits offend you?”</p><p>“I just… Rio, goddamn cover up.”</p><p>Rio huffed, missed the second look exchanged between Stevie and Frankie and shoved the black cami Alice had handed her over her head.</p><p>“Happy?”</p><p>“Not really, no.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned back to grab the sweater held out to her and proceeded to shove <em>that</em> over her head.</p><p>It took a second and then… Alice laughed. A great, big, boom of a laugh. More of an explosion, actually.</p><p>And Rio looked down at herself to see what was so funny.</p><p>Written across the black sweater were the words, in a bold rainbow font, ‘Make the yuletide gay’.</p><p>“Oh no, absolutely not. I’m not wearing this on camera.”</p><p>“Come on!” Stevie announced with a grin, clearly trying to hold in her own laughter where Frankie and Alice were already lost causes.</p><p>“Agatha has a ‘fa la la la la lesbian’ one.”</p><p>“That doesn’t even make any sense.”</p><p>Rio turned to the mirror and scowled at the sight of herself. She’d avoided the mirror most of the day and she couldn’t believe that now was the time she was utilising it. That now she was in this joke of a sweater, her hair mussed from all the on and offing she’d been doing, her eyes large and tired, and now was when she was taking in her appearance properly for the first time.</p><p>“I’m vetoing it.”</p><p>“No, noooo,” Alice trilled, “this is excellent payback for your tits being out all day.”</p><p>“You never <em>usually</em> complain.”</p><p>Rio began tugging at the sweater, wondering if it would look better in situ on the set and not whilst she was the only person in the room wearing anything remotely christmassy.</p><p>Stevie and Frankie (now recovered from their laughter) looked at each other again.</p><p>“Is Agatha going to wear hers?”</p><p>“Unclear, but got a message from her camp a second ago so Stevie’s going to head over there in a second. She’ll ask for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, wondered briefly how Agatha would feel about wearing the word ‘lesbian’ across her chest, tried not to think about the last time she had a lesbian <em>on</em> her chest, and then disappeared into the little makeshift changing room just to be alone for a second.</p><p>It didn’t last long. Alice joined her almost immediately.</p><p>“I wasn’t offended by your tits. It’s just… You show off more when you’re upset,” Alice said softly as she tugged the heavy curtain across and Rio stopped where she’d been about to strip again.</p><p>“Or feeling vulnerable or-…”</p><p>“I get it.”</p><p>“I just felt like you were parading around-…”</p><p>“I wasn’t <em>parading</em>. Besides, do you know how far sex is from my mind right now?”</p><p>Alice didn’t need to know what she’d just been thinking.</p><p>Alice pursed her lips but said nothing else as Rio went to lift the sweater up and threw it onto the nearby clothes rail.</p><p>Alice handed her the next one and Rio checked it first to see if there were any jokes written across it but found only a reindeer and so reluctantly put that one on.</p><p>She stepped back out to be assessed and found that Stevie had disappeared whilst she’d been alone with Alice.</p><p>Frankie hummed and made Rio stand by the wall so she could take a polaroid of her to add to the now busy collection on the cork board at the far end of the space.</p><p>“Not sure on the colour on this one. There’s a blue version we could try…”</p><p>“Whatever works best,” Rio said with a shrug, a little pissed at Alice’s suggestion that she’d been parading.</p><p>She didn’t <em>parade</em>, she was just doing her job. And the easiest way to do her job in that moment was to let the costume department throw things on and off her body as quickly as possible which meant often standing around in a bra as she waited.</p><p>Besides, it was warm, she wasn’t exactly <em>naked</em>, she was simply doing her job.</p><p>These words went round and round in her mind as she waited on Frankie to source the second option for the reindeer sweater and out of the corner of her eye she caught Alice watching her closely and then she thought, perhaps, she was being a little unfair.</p><p>Alice had watched her like a hawk since she’d stepped into her room on Wednesday morning. She’d not left her side once. She’d even slept with her to make sure she was okay in the night.</p><p>She was looking out and doing a thorough job of it.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and shame-faced looked down to her feet.</p><p>“Frank?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Did I make you uncomfortable being in my bra earlier?”</p><p>Alice stood from where she’d sat and Rio ignored her as she looked over at Frankie who had her back to her and was rummaging through the rails. “What? No. Easier to get things on and off.”</p><p>Rio nodded, cleared her throat and mumbled, “That’s what I thought.”</p><p>Alice had arrived by her side and turned her head with her hand on her cheek, “I’m just looking out.”</p><p>Rio smiled, nodded, briefly kissed Alice’s hand, “I know. I just wanted to be sure no one else was offended by my <em>parading</em>.”</p><p>Rolling her eyes Alice pulled away just as Frankie turned with the found sweater in her hands and cheered as she did. “Next!”</p><p>Rio took it and again disappeared for a second to herself, to breathe, to think.</p><p>But she stopped what she was doing when she heard it. Her new sweater was rouched across her chest, and despite the stuffiness of the trailer, her skin felt cold as she listened to the soft conversation happening just beyond the heavyset curtain that separated the changing area from the rest of the space.</p><p>Stevie had clearly arrived back.</p><p>“No, it was like… she requested it.”</p><p>“But?”</p><p>“I know, silent all morning and then-…”</p><p>Rio pulled the curtain back, stomach now covered by the navy version of the earlier reindeer sweater.</p><p>The two people huddled together in the centre of the trailer looked up, both wide-eyed and caught. In one set of arms there was a pile of small boxes, some an infamous light blue, others varying shades of black, brown, blood red.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Stevie, carrying the boxes, cleared her throat and went to offload them onto the countertop.</p><p>Rio looked on as they spilled over the area and then turned to Alice, and saw that she looked a little paler than she’d been when Rio had last appeared from behind the curtain.</p><p>“We have rings for you. Wedding rings, you know.”</p><p>Frankie looked a little startled and Rio slowly moved closer, wondering if in her semi-stupor through the morning she’d accidentally told everyone <em>exactly</em> how she felt about being fake married to Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said softly, shaking her head just a little in a move Rio took to be a warning.</p><p>But her brown eyes were back on the little boxes that Stevie was now carefully righting and opening for her to see.</p><p>“We got lucky. We had a few in storage, some are loaned from different jewellers, some have been brought in from our personal collections of costumes. You have about two dozen all in all, all in her size.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows in surprise, felt her stomach drop. “<em>Her</em> size?”</p><p>“Yeah, so,” Stevie righted the final box and Frankie began to arrange them more neatly across the counter. “Agatha’s just suggested it might be cute for you guys to pick each others rings.”</p><p>“Oh, I…”</p><p>Is this what it felt like to simply die? To just stop all regular bodily functions, anything life-preserving, anything protecting you from simply… ceasing to exist.</p><p>“I was just saying to Frankie,” Stevie said with a smile, “Agatha’s apparently been basically mute all day and hasn’t really had many opinions on anything and then all of a sudden!”</p><p>Rio bit down on her tongue, staring now at the little box Stevie still held in her hand; the box she assumed must hold the ring Agatha had picked for her.</p><p>“So she could really rock silver <em>or</em> gold and she’s got long fingers so they could take a bigger ring. We’re gonna go trimmed nails too so I’d recommend-…”</p><p>But Rio still hadn’t moved, still hadn’t even looked properly at the selection of rings she was now being shown. Because picking a ring for Agatha <em>meant</em> something and right now everything meant <em>too much</em>.</p><p>“Alice, you pick for her,” she said in as calm a voice as she could. Dragging her eyes away from the box that she’d assumed held her own ring she turned to Alice with a pleading look in her eye, “Please.”</p><p>Alice moved over and only lightly touched Rio’s arm - nothing that would look suspicious - as Rio allowed Frankie to pick a little at her sweater, pushing the sleeves up to her elbows to get a look at it being worn in different ways.</p><p>“This is cute on you.”</p><p>But Rio was too distracted by the ring she’d yet to lay eyes on.</p><p>What would Agatha have picked for her? Something big? Something with a plain diamond? A coloured gemstone?</p><p>As Frankie was adjusting her collar she finally said, “Stevie? Which did she pick for me?”</p><p>Alice glanced at her over her shoulder as Stevie jumped to attention and grinned as she opened the box with a flourish and offered it up for Rio to inspect. “Gorgeous, right? She picked it immediately.”</p><p>Sitting upright in the cream cushion was a round diamond set against a gold band. It was a perfect cut, a perfect clarity, and Rio could only guess how many carats.</p><p>Stevie plucked it out when Rio made no move to and held up the gold band for her to try it on but tense fingers remained tense by Rio’s side and she didn’t raise them up.</p><p>“Pretty,” she managed to get out, turning away from it as Stevie tilted her head in question. “I’ll lose it or damage it if I wear it now. Keep it safe and I’ll try it on properly when we start shooting.”</p><p>Rio was saved the slightly perplexed look from her dresser when Alice turned around and held up a closed box, “Got it. This one.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, only followed the motion of Frankie’s hand as she silently asked her to stand by the blank wall so they could take shots of the blue reindeer sweater.</p><p>She posed, sans ring, smiled and tried to look like any normal person might who was trying on someone else’s clothes for the day. But now leaving the trailer with Stevie was the ring Alice had chosen for Agatha, the ring Rio would have to see every day from now on.</p><p>She’d have to watch as Agatha acted like her wife, dressed like her wife, wore a ring like her wife.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio jumped, blinked away the daze she’d been in.</p><p>“There’s pyjamas on the stand, will you try them on please? Unsure if we want tartan or the navy ones. We’ll need to see what Agatha looks good in.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t bring herself to ask if that meant she’d be matching with Agatha. She could only go in behind the curtain, taking a second to just breathe until she heard the rustle of it open again and felt someone help her tug her sweater over her head.</p><p>“I went pear,” Alice said softly, now turning to fold the sweater, “gold. Maybe not her taste, definitely not yours, but… more than she deserves.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, snatching up the tartan pyjama top first and allowing Alice to help with the lower buttons as she did the top.</p><p>“Trying to buy you with a fucking car and now a ring she hasn’t even bought I-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio started in the softest voice she could manage. “Please.”</p><p>Looking up she saw Alice freeze, saw her work her jaw and drop her hands from the middle button of her shirt. “I should have stepped in sooner, I should have-…”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and without warning turned around to rip the curtain open and frighten poor Stevie who’d been piling the ring boxes back up.</p><p>“Frankie, could we have five, please?”</p><p>“Oh, uh, sure. I’ll just… go see how the others are doing.”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly and just about managed a smile before Frankie was gone.</p><p>“You couldn’t have stopped me, Alice. And honestly, I wouldn’t have wanted you to.”</p><p>“What? Rio, have you <em>seen</em> yourself? Are you so out of it that you don’t feel-…?”</p><p>“I feel <em>everything</em>, Alice. I feel… I can feel the blood coursing through my veins and my heart lying broken in my chest but I… I had her. I had what my parents have. I had it for barely any time at all but I <em>had</em> it and I think that’s worth the pain of-…”</p><p>She’d wheeled around and something in her friend’s eyes made her stop. She slammed her mouth shut and swallowed thickly, “Am I pathetic?”</p><p>“No, no. <em>No</em>. You’re just… I forgot with all the one night stands and… you’re just a romantic. And I’m so fucking sorry that you’re hurting. I wish I could… God I want to kill her.”</p><p>Rio smiled weakly and rested back against the counter. “Please don’t. Losing her is one thing, having her die… I don’t think I’d ever recover.”</p><p>“You’ll recover, Rio. You’ll recover from <em>this</em>.”</p><p>“No,” Rio’s smile withered, barely having bloomed in the first place, “no, probably not.”</p><p>“Tell me again when, one day, you’re on the floor playing with a little baby and your wife is making you pollo guisado in the kitchen.”</p><p>Alice couldn’t have known that Agatha had made her that very dish on their first night together in their Berkeley home and Rio didn’t have the heart anymore to tell her.</p><p>A knock at the door though meant she didn’t have time to, even if she’d wanted to. Alice checked her over once before she went to open it and Rio swallowed when she saw who it was.</p><p>Agatha was stepping into the room, wrapped in a white dressing gown, her hair in a devastatingly chic messy up do, her face tired, her eyes only on Rio.</p><p>“Agatha suggested we test the way the pyjamas look together,” came Stevie’s chirpy voice as she stepped in behind Agatha. “Oh good, you went tartan first.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t breath as she watched Agatha drop her gown, watched as she moved towards her, watched as she stopped before her. Her usually bright blue eyes looked weary as they settled around Rio’s throat and Rio adjusted her posture to stand a little straighter, needing that inch or so she had on Agatha to feel even a semblance of power as she stood hopelessly before her.</p><p>“Frank, the tinsel,” Stevie was instructing from somewhere else in the room. Rio was aware that people were moving, was vaguely cognisant of Alice moving closer in her periphery, and Jen taking a seat on the couch, of Agatha’s team moving about to help, but all she could really focus on was Agatha as she raised her hands up under the pretence of fixing Rio’s collar.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>Agatha was gentle, fixing something that didn’t need to be fixed, her gaze apparently still too shy to rise the few inches it needed to to match Rio’s. “Pensé… Solo quería elegy tu anillo, aunque fuera fingido.” <em>I thought… I just wanted to pick your ring, even in pretend.”</em></p><p>Rio closed her eyes just as Agatha raised her gaze and the soft adjustments of her fingers paused.</p><p>“God, fuck, one of the boxes in back!”</p><p>“No! The other!”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>The sounds of everyone nearby searching for tinsel, of Alice reaching to pull Rio away from Agatha, they were all lost to her when she felt Agatha’s soft breath against her ear, heard the words she now whispered in even gentler Spanish: “Lo sent mucho, Rio. Por favor, créeme cuànto lo siento. Por favor, déjame compensarte. Quiero esto. Te deseo. Te amo.” <em>I’m so sorry, Rio. Please believe how sorry I am. Please let me make it up to you. I want this. I want you. I love you.</em></p><p>At some point in Agatha’s speech, Rio’s fingers had found the hem of her tartan cotton shirt, and Rio’s face had turned unconsciously into the warmth of Agatha, into the comfort of her.</p><p>But Alice was clutching her now, gently tugging her away until their hold dropped and Rio felt the chill of a life where Agatha wasn’t against her anymore.</p><p>Rio didn’t look around to see what Agatha had done when she’d been pulled away but she accepted a bottle of water from Alice and drank down half of it just for something to do, something to feel that wasn’t the constant pull of Agatha.</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>“Okay! Ladies! We gotta pose you. First in the tartan, then in the blue. I think the winner is gonna be tartan but… we can let Maria decide later.”</p><p>Rio allowed herself to be positioned back against the white wall and she forced herself to smile, forced herself to relax her shoulders and didn’t quite look when Agatha was moved to her side.</p><p>It was awkward at first because neither reached for the other. They both just stood there, two strangers now, though they’d shared so much and lost even more.</p><p>Stevie galloped forwards to drape them in tinsel and Rio remained silent as she let her hand be positioned on Agatha’s shoulder and felt Agatha naturally wrap her own around her waist.</p><p>“Frank, the ring?”</p><p>Rio felt her chest tighten when she realised what was about to happen and Agatha asked, “You didn’t like it?”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“Oh she hasn’t tried it on yet,” Stevie grinned and waved her hand through the air, turning to see where Frankie had got to.</p><p>“I didn’t think I’d need to until filming began.”</p><p>She shot a glance at Agatha and saw she was looking down at her feet, saw that she was working her jaw, saw the glazed look in her eyes.</p><p>The ring was placed on her finger as she continued to watch Agatha and she felt the hold of it as viscerally as she felt the arm still wrapped around her, the hand curling around her side.</p><p>“Perfect. Show them off for me!”</p><p>Rio turned back to smile at Stevie, and in doing so she splayed her fingers out as her hand rested on Agatha’s shoulder and Agatha moved in closer, holding up her hand for the wardrobe team to get a sight of.</p><p>Rio felt sick with it, felt horrified that this was how she would exchange rings with Agatha Harkness. But then again, it always was too good to be true. Always a luck only found in movies, for other people, not for Rio Vidal.</p><p>Stevie and Frankie, and now Agatha’s team who’d arrived to enjoy the show, were debating on whether either of them needed to have their hair changed or for some different lighting, some slippers or accessories.</p><p>And Rio sucked in a breath before she turned to Agatha, turning fully, making their bodies face one another. Agatha flowed with her, melting into the new hold without hesitation and Rio watched as her eyes flashed with something that she’d spotted briefly at the read through: hope.</p><p>“Necesito que dejes de darme regalos. Deja de decirme que lo sientes, que... me quieres. Necesito tiempo. Necesito... Necesito poder pensar. Apenas puedo...” <em>I need you to stop giving me gifts. Stop stop telling me you're sorry, that you... love me. I need some time. I need... I need to be able to think. I can barely...</em></p><p>Rio paused, took a breath, was barely able to meet Agatha’s gaze when she finished, this time in English. “Please just, give me some time.”</p><p>“Rio,” Stevie was saying, and Rio turned  to her but caught sight too of Alice and Jen eyeing them up from across the room, “Couch, please.”</p><p>Rio nodded and turned back to Agatha and saw that she looked paler than even before. But she pulled away instead of reaching for her like she wanted to and she went to sit in the middle of the couch. Stevie draped her in tinsel and Rio held it like a towel round her neck as she settled cross-legged in the centre of the couch.</p><p>She caught Alice’s eye and forced a small smile as she saw the death grip Alice had on Jen’s hand. It didn’t relax her to know that Alice was suffering for this too.</p><p>But then Agatha sat down and sat so far away that Alice’s suffering was nothing to her own.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and threw one half of the tinsel over Agatha’s shoulder. She looked at her, waited until Agatha glanced her way, and then she smiled. And for the first time it didn’t feel forced.</p><p>Agatha, in her red tartan pyjamas with the gold tinsel draped haphazardly over her shoulder, looked as Rio had imagined she might on Christmas morning and for a second she allowed herself to pretend it was real.</p><p>So she’d smiled.</p><p>So she shifted back and took the tinsel and draped her arm over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate to move closer and Rio realised she’d sat far away because in her mind “time” meant “space”. But no time nor space would ever truly help Rio in the continuum of her fluctuating pain and desire.</p><p>So when Agatha cautiously sat in the space offered and leant fully into her side, she felt every tug of her heartstrings and every whisper of hope. Because Agatha in her arms felt right, it <em>always</em> felt right.</p><p>“Oh man, Rio. The internet will lose it when I post these.”</p><p>“Oh I,” Rio began, instinctively tugging Agatha closer.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. Post them. Give Jen the last say but…” and Agatha shifted to rest back more against Rio. “It’s fine.”</p><p>And as their two managers fussed and the stylists began to adjust their clothing and their bodies Rio thought that, with Agatha securely against her side, it might be. She inhaled her without thinking, she scrunched the soft fabric of her pyjamas in her longing hand, she pretended so hard it felt almost real.</p><p>Agatha moved her left hand to rest delicately on her knee and Rio, taking the bait without thinking, moved her own left hand to hold it.</p><p>The gaps between her fingers had been filled again. She still felt broken, but all her pieces were there.</p><p>The only difference was, Agatha’s hand now had a new ring.</p><p>It was yellow gold with a pear shaped diamond. It wasn’t right. It didn’t look right. It wasn’t what Rio would have picked for her.</p><p>But Agatha was still wearing it, hadn’t said anything against it, and now clutched at her as if she didn’t want to let go.</p><p>The first time they’d met, properly, years after their first introduction in a grimy bathroom, they’d sat in a similar position. Only Rio’s hand had been against Agatha’s knee, and Agatha’s hand had held her there.</p><p>Somewhere in the months since that moment they’d switched positions.</p><p>But Rio remembered the stress of that day, the fear that she was touching Agatha too much or being weird around her. She felt it still in her deepest self; the fear that she was being uncool when really she wanted to impress, to woo, the prettiest girl in the room.</p><p>Agatha’s hand was soft beneath her own and she found that she’d curled her fingers back on themselves to hold Rio’s in place. It was subtle, delicate, but enough for Rio to know that she wanted her there, that she wasn’t letting go.</p><p>“God the Vidalitas are going to eat this up.”</p><p>The tension snapped immediately and Rio exhaled sharply through her nose at the nickname sometimes given to a particularly staunch section of her fans. She felt Agatha squeeze her hand and saw Jen move over even though Rio’s dark eyes remained down on the diamonds blinking back up at her still.</p><p>“It’s a bit… do you look a little cosy, Agatha?”</p><p>Rio anticipated that Agatha would move away, that she’d shrink forwards or simply let go, but she stayed where she was. If anything, she held on tighter.</p><p>“Check the lighting’s okay, Jen. Other than that, I’m fine where I am.”</p><p>“Amaaaaaazing!” Stevie sang out, practically bouncing about the place to get the right angle. Rio remained still.</p><p>It felt as if the small gang of people now watching them and taking photos were intruding on their private time together. Only the last time they’d sat like this Rio hadn’t felt sick to her stomach that she’d only now have access to Agatha in a manufactured way, in a way that meant they’d have eyes on them always. In a way that meant the rings they wore were as fake as the smile that Rio was beaming at the camera.</p><p>And then it was done, they were told they could change to the blue pyjamas and Agatha was the first to move. She pulled up and turned around but held on to Rio’s hand and Rio watched her for a second, smiled a little as Agatha turned around and offered her free hand to help Rio up.</p><p>She’d done it yesterday and Rio had ignored it. But now, now their hands were already joined, now she wore a ring Agatha had picked for her, now she couldn’t refuse.</p><p>She took the offered hand and Agatha barely helped - because Rio was uninjured, barely in her thirties, and had no problem standing from a couch - but she held her all the same.</p><p>The chatter around them continued as the two small teams of wardrobe assistants debated on whether they should get snaps of the two stars in <em>other</em> outfits too. But it was lost to Rio as Agatha continued to hold on and said, “I can wait. I can be good. I… when you’re ready, I’d like to explain. Please. Please let me explain.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, looked down at their ring fingers, felt her heart slip down into her stomach. Down, down, down, with no way up.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Rio looked up.</p><p>Up into Agatha’s desperate eyes, up into the face she’d memorised long ago. This was a woman she would have trusted with her life, who she <em>had</em> trusted with her heart.</p><p>“Okay. Just…” Alice was moving in, her hand on Rio’s side to guide her away. “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p>She released her hands as Alice led her to the makeshift changing area. Alice held the curtain back for her and Rio said nothing as she slipped inside and began to strip once the curtain was pulled again.</p><p>“What’re you doing, Rio?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t find the words to answer Alice so she chose not to.</p><p>She just allowed her to help her shrug her blue shirt on. She let her help with the buttons. She listened as she whispered quietly, <em>urgently</em>, “I know how hard this is. I know it’s so tough. But it’s been barely forty eight hours. You need to give it some time.”</p><p>“I’ve told her. I…”</p><p>“I just want you to be okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded and cleared her throat as she changed her pants over and turned then properly to look at Alice. She took a second and then leant in and pressed close to whisper directly into her ear, “Thank you for watching out. I’ve told her I need time. I think… I think she understands.”</p><p>She felt Alice nod, their temples now touching. As Rio took a second to breathe she felt Alice’s hand clutch at the thin fabric around her shoulder. “Will you be okay if I take Jen out for a bit? I haven’t had a chance to-…”</p><p>“Yes. That’s fine. It’ll be fine.”</p><p>Alice only kissed her cheek briefly and then pulled back the curtains for them so Rio could swap with Agatha. Unlike her, Agatha went in to change alone and Jen remained where she was at the counter.</p><p>“Is,” Stevie said with a wry smile, “is there something going on between you two?”</p><p>“Which two?” Jen said sharply, moving forwards a little as if moving would throw off the scent.</p><p>“Rio and Alice,” Frankie said breezily, rushing about the room to gather up the outfits they’d already decided would belong to Dani’s wardrobe.</p><p>“<em>Excuse me</em>?”</p><p>Rio almost smiled at Jen’s reaction, almost actually <em>laughed</em> at it. But Alice shot her a warning look and ran around Rio to get to Jen where she immediately held her wrists and moved them backwards.</p><p>It was adorable to watch and Rio suddenly wished she and Agatha had been accused just to see what Agatha might have done. Then again, best not. Best not have Agatha doing as Alice was currently doing, holding her wrists and pinning her against the counter.</p><p>Jen at least looked unfazed with Alice where Rio was sure she’d have been a blushing mess at the mere prospect of Agatha doing that to her.</p><p>At the idea that she’d ever be that fierce in her desire for her again.</p><p>She heard Alice muttering reassurances to Jennifer and so took it upon herself to respond in her stead: “We’re just friends. Alice and Jen are dating.”</p><p>“And <em>why</em> would you think Alice and Rio were dating?”</p><p>Rio shot Jen a look out of the corner of her eye and turned back to Stevie with her smile now firmly in place on her face. Now shaken of the image of Agatha holding her against anything she felt she had some leeway to tease just a little: “That would be all the kissing, r-…?”</p><p>Three things happened simultaneously: the curtain was ripped back, Jen exclaimed Rio’s name, Alice slapped her arm.</p><p>But Rio was only really interested in one of those things. Agatha’s jaw was tense, but she wasn’t looking at Rio. In her navy blue pyjamas she moved across to the couch again and silently took back the position she’d been in before.</p><p>“Wait, Agatha. We need the wall shots first for our board.”</p><p>“Here’s fine,” Agatha said curtly as she turned her gaze to Rio and raised her hand - her left.</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek, an old almost-forgotten sensation sparking somewhere in her body but bouncing around so furtively she almost couldn’t name it. Though she knew logically what it must be.</p><p>Her tired, broken self was still attuned to Agatha. And Agatha looking murderous was never not going to do things to her. Her body was still desperate for Agatha, still turned on by Agatha. Only the ignition was a little tough, a little slow to fire.</p><p>She accepted the hand held out to her and settled back down beside Agatha. Only this time, this time Agatha was the one who wrapped her arm around Rio, though not across her shoulders like Rio had done to her. She instead held her waist, pulled her in close to her side, and stared straight ahead.</p><p>Rio delicately rested her hand on Agatha’s knee and for only the briefest of moments did it remain unheld. As Agatha’s fingers slipped into their rightful place Rio cleared her throat softly and Agatha glanced askance at her.</p><p>The fantasy of before had dissolved now; the mirage clear when Rio met Agatha’s gaze. Far from the tightness of her jaw, the strong hold of her fingers, her eyes remained soft, almost as if the strain of keeping them open was too much.</p><p>Rio wondered if she’d slept. She guessed Jen wouldn’t do what Alice was doing for her and wouldn’t curl up beside her at night. Agatha probably wouldn’t want it anyway.</p><p>And as much as Rio was hurting <em>because</em> of the woman holding her tight, she didn’t want to see Agatha suffer.</p><p>A couple shots were taken of them - none this time, where either managed to smile.</p><p>When they were asked to move to the wall, Agatha still stood first, still turned around. Rio accepted again and didn’t release her hand even as they stood next to each other and allowed the Polaroids to be taken of them in their matching costumes.</p><p>The wardrobe team were loud again now, after the awkwardness of the question earlier, and one of them had decided Christmas music would add to the atmosphere.</p><p>And Rio just stood, her hand in Agatha’s, their shoulders touching, her feet lifting each time a sock was put on or taken off, a slipper was added or removed.</p><p>She’d usually be participating in the nonsense by showing off that she could in fact hold a tune and knew all the lyrics to every single Christmas song that had ever been released. But holding Agatha’s hand and remaining silent was all she could currently manage to do.</p><p>“Okay!” Rio glanced over at Geri, one of the other wardrobe assistants helping Agatha. “We’ll go and get a couple of Agatha’s pieces and bring them back over just to check where everything will sit together and we’ll be right back.”</p><p>Soon the four women, one couple, two disasters, were left alone to the jaunty sounds of Feliz Navidad.</p><p>“I know you’re going through it but <em>don’t</em> joke about kissing my girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched in Rio’s and Rio could only sigh, interrupted before she could speak by Alice. “It was a joke, Jen. God knows we all need one.”</p><p>Jen’s jaw twitched and then she relaxed it, seemingly with some effort, and Rio cleared her throat quietly as she stepped away from Agatha and released her hand. “I’m sorry. It was a lame joke.”</p><p>Jen nodded and Alice spoke again, “Everyone’s just… super fucking tense. That’s all.”</p><p>Rio scoffed quietly and went to sit back down on the couch, rubbing her hands over her face. She felt someone else sit down too and looked to see Agatha curling her feet beneath herself.</p><p>She looked small in her large sweater and Rio felt like reaching for her again but knew she couldn’t. She’d asked for time and Agatha was giving her space.</p><p>She had to make it easier for her to do so by not reaching out constantly.</p><p>She made a choice then not to touch her again. It was best for both of them.</p><p>No one said anything until the wardrobe ladies were back. It was a painful ten minutes but Rio didn’t raise her gaze anymore. She couldn’t bare to see Agatha still there, now just waiting for her.</p><p>But in her torment she soon swung back to the soft promise of anger that had been bubbling away in her stomach all this time - dormant, but ever-present.</p><p><em>She</em> had waited for Agatha, she’d waited months for her, patiently, pliantly. And it pained her even now to see Agatha waiting what was less than three days.</p><p>Had it hurt Agatha to make Rio wait? Did Agatha really think that little of her? Did she really despise her? Was this all part of the trick?</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped at the sudden sound of Alice’s voice and she looked up to see everyone looking at her expectantly and saw that Agatha was in new clothes now, and Rio would have to do the same.</p><p>Doing preventing the thinking. She moved quickly and silently through three more outfits and each time allowed her photo be taken separately and together with Agatha.</p><p>The fifth such time they had to wait by the designated wall for the camera to be reloaded and Rio had had enough of silence. In the time she’d spend not thinking she’d also spent looking at Agatha, seeing how exhausted she was, how she kept her gaze down unless she were looking at Rio, or answering a direct question.</p><p>And so she cleared her throat quietly, leaning now as she was back against the wall with her hands behind the small of her back.</p><p>“Are you sleeping?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Rio glanced at her. “No.”</p><p>“Your pills? Are they not-…?”</p><p>“I’m not taking them.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>. You’ll make yourself sick.”</p><p>“I’m fine, Rio.”</p><p>Rio shifted an inch, freed her hand and slowly reached for Agatha’s arm but remembered her earlier promise to herself and hesitated before she pulled her hand back and watched blue eyes close. “You don’t look it.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, a sad sort of laugh that made Rio want to cry. “So Jen keeps telling me.”</p><p>“Tequila helps. It’s helped me.”</p><p>“I have Nicky. I can’t get drunk.”</p><p>Agatha had said the words softly, barely above a whisper, but they triggered the memory of the accusation thrown at her not three days ago: <em>“you’re a child, you could never be mature enough”.</em></p><p>She released a sigh and hid her hand back behind herself but Agatha had turned fully now, was watching her with a steady gaze. “How long, I mean, how long do you think you’ll need?”</p><p>“I can’t answer that.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio could only watch as she turned away again. It didn’t take long for Agatha to be ushered behind the curtain once more and Rio was made to wait her turn before she could change.</p><p>It was farcical, really. The two of them constantly changing into different sweaters, into velvet dresses or silk shirts, into coats and scarves and gloves and hats, but both remained resolutely unchanged in their misery.</p><p>The other thing that remained were their rings. Rio was dressed up in more jewellery, or less depending on the outfit, but the rings on her left finger always remained the same: a gold band to symbolise the union, a round diamond to symbolise Agatha.</p><p>She watched too as Agatha was dressed up and down in a variety of jewellery for each costume and with each second of peace she’d always be toying with the ring that Alice had chosen for her, the ring she still believed was from Rio.</p><p>In these moments Rio couldn’t bring herself to look for long because any idea that Agatha was deriving comfort from the ring made her feel nauseous. But she was back to wanting to comfort her again, to tell her all was forgiven and all was okay.</p><p>But in those moments, those weak moments where she just <em>craved</em> Agatha, she thought of Agatha craving Ralph instead of her and she was able to look away, to stop herself reaching for her.</p><p>By the time they were on their tenth change both Jen and Alice excused themselves and Rio and Agatha were left alone with the wardrobe ladies. The atmosphere didn’t change but perhaps Rio felt a little less stifled.</p><p>It meant only one set of eyes were on her at all times rather than three.</p><p>Jen and Alice didn’t return for another hour and when they did they both looked shell shocked. From where Rio sat in one of the high chairs by the long mirror above the counter they looked as if they’d both been crying.</p><p>Not long after that they were released.</p><p>Agatha and Jen left, Jen giving Rio a quick kiss on the cheek and Agatha hesitating before she did the same. Only Agatha lingered, she held Rio’s hand, she said quietly: “I’m here, whenever you’re ready. Take… as long as you want.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, only look away the moment Agatha pulled back.</p><p>It took half an hour for her and Alice to leave after them. Rio was back in her actual clothes feeling exhausted and burnt out. The sun was setting so the sky was a glorious mix of pinks and oranges.</p><p>It was a calm night but the storm raged on inside Rio with no hopes of soon abating.</p><p>As they made their way across the lot Rio looked up and saw Agatha standing talking to Maria. She looked resplendent in the soft evening glow. The setting sun made it look as though there was a filter on her, a soft lens made to turn up the saturation and make Rio’s heart sing at the sight of the woman she loved.</p><p>Agatha turned to her, she paused a while, and then she waved at her, and Rio saw in the velvety light of the evening that Agatha still wore the ring Alice had picked for her and that despite looking exhausted she was still looking at Rio with that tender gaze.</p><p>As the last rays of sunshine sprinkled their light across the trailers and the tarmac, Rio left with her best friend and the woman who loved her watched her go, the ring she thought Rio had chosen for her turning round and round on her finger as if she were trying to hasten the clock until Rio was ready to talk.</p>

<p>“Morning, sleepyhead.”</p><p>Rio huffed and buried herself beneath her duvet. Alice ignored this and tugged it back.</p><p>“Hello, Angel! Rise and shine, buttercup! Let’s go, bro!”</p><p>“What is <em>wrong</em> with you?”</p><p>Rio snatched the duvet back.</p><p>“What on earth could you mean, sweetums?”</p><p>“Alice!” Her shout was muffled, her mouth now buried under the thick coils of duvet she’d bundled back over herself.</p><p>“Get up, would you? I want to show you something.”</p><p>Rio groaned and curled up some more, “Sleep is the closest thing I have to-…”</p><p>“Don’t you dare say it.”</p><p>Rio huffed and felt the prickle of shame across her cheeks, “Fine, Alice.” She grumbled some more as she shoved the heavy fabric from her face and pushed herself into a sitting position. “Show me what?”</p><p>“I think it’s important you know how crazed the internet is about Agatha’s casting.”</p><p>“Jesus, Alice. <em>Why?</em>”</p><p>“Because,” Alice said in a slightly softer voice as she scrambled up to sit beside Rio in the bed, only just about convincing her to let her slip under the blankets with her. “Agatha’s getting a lot of heat from it. From what I can tell and from what Jen thinks-…”</p><p>Rio turned her head away when Alice offered her phone to her. She’d avoided any external influence on her thus far, she couldn’t give in now.</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said quietly, turning back to her phone as she blindly reached beside her to grab the coffee she’d made Rio earlier and pass it over to her. “I want you to have all the information, that’s all.”</p><p>“I don’t need any information.”</p><p>Agatha fucked Ralph. Agatha thought she was a child. Agatha had forced them together on a movie where they had to play wives.</p><p>What else was there to know?</p><p>“Well,” Alice said matter-of-factly, “Would you like to know that everyone is very excited to see you in a Christmas sweater with a kid?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Rio huffed out a breath and shuffled down the bed until she could lean her head against Alice’s arm. “Is that supposed to thrill me?”</p><p>“Fuel your ego maybe.”</p><p>“I doubt people are saying anything about me that doesn’t involve Agatha.”</p><p>“Well,” Alice said slowly, as she began to flick through her phone, all of Rio’s socials logged in and ready to go. “There are people who… are very pleased.”</p><p>Rio scoffed softly and carefully sipped her coffee. “Good, that’s all that matters.”</p><p>“Don’t be a dick. They don’t know. This is a huge win, you know. Agatha Harkness playing a dyke is insane.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“I know, I know it’s hard. I just, was hoping knowing how excited people are that it might make it even slightly easier.”</p><p>Rio groaned in response, now allowing the hot mug she was holding to burn the sensitive skin of her hands.</p><p>She was silent as Alice continued to scroll, occasionally tapping a quick message off to someone but otherwise flicking between Rio’s various social media profiles. She knew what she was doing and what Rio also knew was that she was falling right into Alice’s trap.</p><p>“Fine,” she said eventually and sat up, only just avoiding the tsunami of coffee that almost crashed over her swinging cup.</p><p>“Show me.”</p><p>She kept her gaze down to avoid Alice’s smug smile and kept her eyes trained on the images and tweets Alice had clearly compiled for her. It was a selection of praise for Rio, and she had to admit, she was grateful Alice hadn’t included any of the tweets or posts that included Agatha’s name.</p><p>Alice was trying to boost her ego via her fans.</p><p>It was sweet and not wholly ineffectual.</p><p>Rio took another sip of coffee once she’d had her fill of internet-based compliments.</p><p>But the warm glow could only last so long.</p><p>“Why is Agatha getting a hard time?”</p><p>“I leaked to the press that you were having an affair.”</p><p>If Alice had wanted to get Rio out of bed earlier, she really could have just said that.</p><p>Rio leapt from the bed, throwing coffee around like it was snow on Christmas and stood over Alice with a look that mingled horror and disbelief. “What the fuck, Alice?!”</p><p>Alice, now covered in coffee, blinked up at Rio from beneath her dripping hair. “Okaaaaay… not ready for jokes.”</p><p>“That’s not fucking funny.”</p><p>Rio stepped from the bed, her knee almost buckling from the height of it, and she stormed into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>“Oh come on! You don’t want to get back at her? Even a little bit? Rio!”</p><p>“No! Alice! I want to get back <em>with</em> her!”</p><p>But her words took her by surprise and she stopped and almost slipped where she’d been leaning into the shower to adjust the temperature.</p><p>Alice didn’t bother knocking before just barging in.</p><p>“You want to get back with her?”</p><p>“I want…” Rio sighed heavily, closed her eyes as she leant against the glass screen. “I want to rewind to a time when the biggest, worst thing was that she was married but unhappy and convince her that <em>I</em> could make her happy.”</p><p>“I think,” Alice said in a softer tone than before, “Babe I think she knows you can. Jen said-…”</p><p>“Don’t. Please. Just. I’m going to shower and then I’m gonna call my dad. Mom will be mad I haven’t called in over a week anyway and… and I need to speak to my dad.”</p><p>She could feel the indecision in Alice’s hesitance to leave but said nothing as she turned to the sink and grabbed her toothbrush. By the time it was carrying the toothpaste, Alice had gone.</p><p>In the mirror she saw a version of herself that she didn’t like.</p><p>She looked pale and tired and exactly like the kind of woman who would willingly allow her heart to be pummelled.</p><p>She didn’t look long.</p><p>She showered and changed into the clothes Alice had left for her in the bed - soft sweatpants and a grey t-shirt with a matching grey cardigan with a vintage argyle pattern. Her phone, plugged in and charging, again because of Alice, lay on the side and she unlocked it, ignored the little red circles that told her people were trying to reach her and instead dialled for her dad.</p><p>“¡Mija! ¿Dónde has estado? Tu madre se ha vuelto loca sin hablarte durante tanto tiempo.” <em>Daughter! Where have you been? Your mother has been going crazy without speaking to you for so long.</em></p><p>Her dad’s voice was enough to make her have to fight back the tears. She must have breathed heavily, must have alerted him with a loud inhalation because Miguel’s tone shifted immediately: “Cariño, ¿qué pasa?”</p><p>It took a few seconds, and her hand holding firm against her chest to prevent her heart simply leaping out and slipping down the phone to her dad but she eventually managed to get out: “No le digas a mamá, ¿de acuerdo?” <em>Don’t tell mom, okay?</em></p><p>And she told him. She told him everything. Minus anything a dad wouldn’t want to hear: exactly why she was on her knees, some of the more graphic details, Agatha’s request for her to put a baby in her, things like that.</p><p>And by the time she was done Alice was back in the room, ready to try and hurry Rio until she saw and heard what she was doing. Her mission to hasten soon became a mission to hold.</p><p>Rio clung to her friend’s hand as she clung to her dad’s soft words.</p><p>“Tienes un buen corazón. Tienes un corazón amoroso. Tu madre y yo te hemos amado con fervor, te hemos protegido, te hemos cuidado. Tenemos suerte de tenerte, mucha suerte. Pero, mi amor, Agatha no ha tenido eso. No la conozco mucho, pero tengo que creer que cualquiera a quien ames tanto es digno de ello. Eres mi hija, tienes mi corazón y te lo confío. Tómate un tiempo para pensar, para sanar un poco, para respirar y ve si después de hacerlo puedes dejar que ella te explique.” <em>You have a good heart. You have a loving heart. Your mother and I have loved you fiercely, protected you, cared for you. We are lucky to have you, so lucky. But, my love, Agatha hasn’t had that. I don't know her well, but I have to believe that anyone who you love this much is worthy of it. You are my daughter, you have my heart, and I trust you with it. Take some time to think, to heal a little, to breathe, and see if, after you have, you can let her explain.</em></p><p>Rio hung up after agreeing to call her dad again that evening.</p><p>Alice kissed her face and dried her tears but said nothing as Rio soon led the way down the stairs, wondering why she ever thought acting for a living was a good idea when she could instead be in a normal nine to five watching a pretty actress with pretty blue eyes and wondering what it might be like to kiss her.</p><p>“We need to get your car back,” Alice muttered as she pulled away from the curb and drove off.</p><p>Rio just shrugged, her head lolling back on the headrest as she looked out the window, her mind elsewhere. “I’m not going anywhere near that house.”</p><p>“You’re rich now,” Alice laughed, “people can do things for you in exchange for money, remember?”</p><p>Rio blindly slapped at her friend and chewed the inside of her cheek, “Okay, will you arrange it? Might take myself off to the beach tomorrow night.”</p><p>“Wait,” Alice said slowly, “I’ll drive. That’s not a problem. I-…”</p><p>“Alice, I didn’t say I’m going to the beach with stones in my pocket. I just need some time alone.”</p><p>Alice was silent for a while which left Rio to imagine the tiny monkey in her brain that was clashing cymbals every time Rio even suggested she take some time to be alone.</p><p>“Fine. Fine. I just, I want you to be okay.”</p><p>“I know.” With a sigh she reached for her friend’s hand. “Are you okay? I’m sorry I was mute last night. Tell me about you. About Jen.”</p><p>Looking into Alice’s face now she saw hesitation and concern and once again Rio thanked the universe that Alice couldn’t act for shit. “What is it?”</p><p>“We’re moving in together.”</p><p>In the place Rio’s heart had once been something darker and insidious appeared. And it became clear in her best friend’s joy that the old Rio Vidal had been razed to nothing.</p><p>“Alice, that’s amazing. Why didn’t you say anything?”</p><p>She felt sick. She turned away from Alice.</p><p>“I was worried that… I want you to know that I’m here for you. Still. Always. We’re only going to make the move when everything is a little more easy.”</p><p>She wanted to cry.</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about me.”</p><p>“But I do. And Jen’s worried about Agatha. We fought about it.”</p><p>Oh good. Alice and Jen fight and they end up moving in. Agatha and Rio fight and Rio ends up wanting to die.</p><p>Fair.</p><p>Totally.</p><p>Utterly.</p><p><em>Fair</em>.</p><p>“I’m so happy for you.”</p><p>“You, you don’t have to lie.”</p><p>Rio squeezed Alice’s hand.</p><p>“I’m truly, totally, utterly, thrilled for you.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Rio looked over and Alice was crying the tears Rio wished she could shed. Only hers were happy and Rio’s were bitter.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Alice pulled her hand away to wipe her eyes.</p><p>“She wants to make you guys talk and I said it was too soon.”</p><p>Rio turned away again.</p><p>“Do you want to talk to her?”</p><p>Her hands twisted and formed a complicated knot in her lap.</p><p>“I want this all to be over.”</p><p><em>I want to fight and end up moving in. I want to rage and end up married. I want to break down and die in her arms when I’m a hundred and happy.</em></p><p>“Tell me how I can help.”</p><p>Rio sighed, closed her eyes, said the thing she knew was right but that felt impossible to vocalise.</p><p>“Move in with Jen. Be happy with her.”</p><p>Alice glanced across at her but Rio remained with her eyes closed, no longer interested in a world where she could have been so misled.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I mean it, Alice.”</p><p>She forced her eyes open, forced herself to look at her friend, to give her an Oscar-winning smile, “You gotta be happy for the both of us. That’s all you need to do for me.”</p><p>Alice looked at her and the bitterness in her chest died in an instant. For a second she thought that maybe, just maybe she’d be okay. She had a best friend who loved her, a family who would do anything for her, and a motherfucking Oscar.</p><p>“Babe, you’re so full of shit.”</p><p>They locked eyes, and laughed at the same time; suddenly living didn’t feel as hard anymore.</p><p>Seven more times on the journey from Rio’s house to the set did Alice promise she wouldn’t move out until Rio was feeling better. Seven more times did Rio reassure Alice that that absolutely wasn’t necessary.</p><p>They agreed to disagree and Alice agreed that she’d stay at least a couple more weeks and Rio agreed that she’d keep the dying jokes to a minimum during that time.</p><p>But all through of dying dissolved in Rio’s addled brain as she stepped, for the first time, into her new trailer. Alice had clearly worked her magic behind the scenes.</p><p>“You’re a goddamn Oscar winner now. You get a whole bedroom in one of these bad boys and everything!”</p><p>Rio laughed as she took in the work her best friend had done to make the typically dry and beige space a cosy hangout for her. On the wall there was a basketball hoop with a bunch of mini basketballs sitting patiently in it for any downtime she’d have.</p><p>The couch in the middle of the space against the back wall was full of cushions and throws and dotted about the place were photos of Rio’s family, of her and Alice, of her and her friends.</p><p>“When did you have time to do this?”</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you earlier? Money means people will do things for you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and sent a light punch towards Alice’s shoulder. “It’s cute. It’s great. Thank you.”</p><p>“Well, I figured it’s going to be a long shoot. You deserve some comfort.”</p><p>With that, Rio found she could relax a while in her new on set home. These four walls would become, would <em>have</em> to become her sanctuary. But there was also a danger they could become her prison.</p><p>Rio moved around her new space, luxuriating in the largest trailer she’d ever been given, and in the thoughtful touches either the studio or Alice had added to make it feel comfortable. The bed was large and Alice, she assumed, had bedecked it with forest green sheets. The kitchen was well stocked with Rio’s favourite snacks and drinks. Upon closer inspection, even the bathroom had all her familiar products in it.</p><p>And Rio realised with a sinking feeling that she’d have to try hard <em>not</em> to make this a prison for herself. Because in here she could be comfortable and outside was Agatha.</p><p>Alice soon insisted on breakfast and ran out to craft services to fetch Rio a bagel and a fresh coffee and they ate happily together, with Alice leading much of the conversation and steering it towards basketball or the exact volume of Rio’s snoring from the night before (“loud, Rio, very loud”).</p><p>But it could only really last for so long and a knock at the door told them that fun time was over. Alice answered it and the sunny, bright Pepper Potts stepped inside the cosy space, her eyes taking in the basketball hoop and the added cushions before they fell to Rio.</p><p>“Morning! I like what you’ve done with the place!”</p><p>“All Alice,” Rio demurred as she stepped in to give Pepper a quick hug.</p><p>“Well it looks <em>fabulous</em>.”</p><p>Rio smiled and offered Pepper a coffee, which she refused as she took a seat on the couch.</p><p>“Alice, if you don’t mind, these sessions always work best when-…”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Alice said with a quick smile though Rio noticed it didn’t quite meet her eyes. “Rio, I’ll be around just call me when you’re done.”</p><p>Rio shot her friend a smile and then settled down onto the couch.</p><p>The room felt charged suddenly, and what was left of Rio’s heart sat solidly in her throat.</p><p>“So,” Pepper began with a slap to her thighs and a kind smile, “Have you done this sort of thing before?”</p><p>“Not with an intimacy coordinator, no.”</p><p>“Well I’m here to make this easier for everyone. We want to create a calm, easy environment where everything but a firm ‘yes’ means ‘no’, okay?”</p><p>Rio wanted to shrug just to see which way Pepper would interpret that but instead she nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>Pepper reached down for her notebook and pulled a pen out of her bag. “Now, sometimes I find that actors are more nervous about the stuff we’re talking about than actual sex scenes. How are you feeling generally about everything? This is all private, so you don’t need to worry about me blabbing to Agatha or Maria. I’ll be your advocate, but it all stays in this room, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, wondering again if a simple shrug would suffice as an answer though something told her it wouldn’t.</p><p>“I feel fine.”</p><p>Pepper nodded, looked down at her notebook and flipped a few pages. “Just fine?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Okay,” Pepper uncapped her pen. “Is there anything outlined in the script you feel not fine about?”</p><p><em>Everything.</em></p><p>“No.”</p><p>Pepper hummed thoughtfully and scribbled Rio’s name down in her book. “So, all good with everything as written?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The next thing Pepper wrote Rio couldn’t quite make out.</p><p>“Easy,” Pepper said with a grin, finally looking back up at Rio. “That’s my job done.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio’s brief moment of relief died upon meeting Pepper’s gaze and she saw in her a woman who wouldn’t back down easily.</p><p>“Look,” she said slowly, “I’m fine with… it’s really whatever’s needed.”</p><p>“Rio, I understand the desire to placate or be amenable but-…”</p><p>“I really, just… am fine with everything.”</p><p>Pepper watched her steadily for a few seconds before she tilted her head, “I was told you were easy to work with, but there’s easy to work with and then there’s not advocating for yourself. Tell me, are you comfortable with everything as is?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, looked down at her hands, tugged unconsciously at her left ring finger. Her <em>empty</em> left ring finger.</p><p>Agatha had given her a fake ring to wear but she’d not given her any reason to trust anything she did. A fake ring meant nothing.</p><p>Her sleeping with her husband the night Rio had first said ‘I love you’, that meant something.</p><p>“No kissing,” she said quickly, hoping if she said it fast it might be missed, “no touching anywhere other than hands. No sitting together in a… always with someone in between, the kid or, whoever. And I’m not saying ‘I love you’. The bed scene. The more kids one, I want that out too.”</p><p>It was more demanding than Rio had ever been in her career, more exacting than she’d ever dared to be. But she’d done it, she’d said it, and Pepper had promised her discretion, so it felt safe to have done so.</p><p>Though she couldn’t figure out why she felt so sick all of a sudden.</p><p>She looked back up and to her surprise Pepper didn’t look surprised. In fact, she didn’t look much of anything.</p><p>But she nodded, she scribbled some notes down, she placed her pen carefully on the coffee table.</p><p>“Okay. We can work around these things. There are ways we can make them more comfortable for you.”</p><p>“No, I… take them out.”</p><p>Pepper cleared her throat and Rio wondered if she’d ever been told anything like this before, if she’d ever had to negotiate with an actor before. But as the concept of arguing a point triggered in her mind so did something else: “Have you spoken to Agatha yet?”</p><p>“We’re focusing on you for now.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her hands again. She was suddenly playing with her ring finger and wondered why she’d never done that before and why now it felt empty all of a sudden.</p><p>“I don’t want to be difficult.”</p><p>“Like I said, the goal is everyone to feel comfortable. I’ll work with you until you do, okay?”</p><p>Rio stole her hand away to run through her hair and cleared her throat again. “What did Agatha say?”</p><p>“We’re focusing on you, remember?”</p><p>“No, I… right. Was she okay? Comfortable, I mean?”</p><p>Pepper reached back for her pen again, “We met this morning. She didn’t have a lot to say, and was fine with everything.”</p><p>“She wants to kiss me?”</p><p><em>God</em>, she was pathetic. <em>God</em>, she hated herself.</p><p>“Has someone got a crush?”</p><p><em>No.</em> She hated <em>Pepper</em>.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Pepper continued as Rio thought about how she could kill either one of them. “I thought I picked up on something at the table read and honestly I thought she was more into you but then again, she’s happily married, right?”</p><p>Pepper smiled a little and Rio thought that maybe of the two choices of victim in the room now she’d rather throw herself upon her own sword.</p><p>Or perhaps Pepper’s pen.</p><p>Whatever was pointy enough to get through to the black heart in her chest.</p><p>“It’s okay to have a crush, Rio. She’s a very attractive woman.”</p><p>Rio stood quickly, marching to the little kitchenette to grab a bottle of water just for something to do.</p><p>She hadn’t had a crush on Agatha since she was a teenager. When she was seventeen she’d seen her at her local cinema up on the big screen with those blue eyes and that perfect face and had then opened to see that face when the lights were out and her hand was between her thighs for many, many nights.</p><p>If only she felt the way her teenage self felt now; that she’d like to kiss Agatha but not that she’d die if she couldn’t ever be with her properly again.</p><p>“I don’t have a crush on Agatha,” Rio said carefully as she walked back over, water bottle in hand. “I just… I’m not comfortable with some of the stage directions, that’s all.”</p><p>Pepper nodded, not looking up but now flicking through her script. “Have you mentioned any of this to Agatha? From what Tony said I-…” She looked up then, her blue eyes a little wider than usual, perhaps due to her indiscretion. “Sorry, spousal privilege, I hear a lot at home I probably…”</p><p>“What were you going to say?”</p><p>“Just that,” Pepper cleared her throat and began to tap her fingers against her script, but Rio tried to keep her face neutral as she waited for the answer. “Just that Agatha was getting progressively… that she really wanted this part. I assumed because you were friends, that’s all.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, briefly thinking of poor Wanda now stuck in a snowy Atlanta doing pickups for her latest movie when she should be here, in the mild climate of LA, <em>not</em> making Rio feel like she wanted to die.</p><p>Those thoughts are what clinched it.</p><p>Agatha had forced her into this. She’d forced everyone into it.</p><p>So, no, she wouldn’t kiss her. She wouldn’t lie in bed with her and whisper that she wanted another kid with her. She wouldn’t wrap her arms around her in every scene or tell her she loved her.</p><p>“Take it all out, Pepper.”</p><p>“I can advocate for you, Rio. That’s no problem. Looking through it… most will just mean different shots, different placements, which I think we can work around. There is, of course,” and here she paused, here she tilted her head and put on her best school teacher voice, “we could use doubles for any of the scenes you don’t want to do.”</p><p>Kissing Agatha was one thing. <em>Not</em> kissing Agatha another. But watching a fake her kiss a fake Agatha, or worse, <em>actual</em> Agatha? Hell on Earth.</p><p>“No. I want none of it. Nothing.” <em>Because I want all of it. Everything.</em></p><p>Pepper nodded and scribbled down some more notes. Rio just watched, now tossing the bottle between her hands.</p><p>“This afternoon the three of us will meet to discuss how we’ll be doing this. And later in the week we have rehearsal time to help choreograph but… looks like there won’t be much to choreograph.”</p><p>It was a lame attempt at a joke but Rio couldn’t bring herself to give a lame laugh.</p><p>“In the meantime,” Pepper said more gently, “I’ll be around if you need me or if there’s anything you want to discuss.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Is that everything?”</p><p>“I’ll leave you to your morning.”</p><p>Rio stood to show Pepper out although it was pretty obvious where the door was in the small rectangle space of the trailer. When they’d said their goodbye she took her seat up again on the sofa and placed her head in her hands.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Alice found her in the exact same position.</p><p>“You were supposed to call me when you were done. It was only when I saw Pepper by crafty that… It went well then?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“Jen said Agatha’s not happy about it.”</p><p>“Yeah? Well she should have thought of that before she put us in this situation.”</p><p>Alice took a seat beside her but Rio had yet to move.</p><p>“We seem to be hovering around the anger and depression steps quite a bit…”</p><p>“Fuck, Alice. Can you stop trying to make jokes!”</p><p>Alice flinched as Rio’s hands flew into the air and she sighed heavily as she touched her friend’s knee, “It was more an observation.”</p><p>“Jesus.”</p><p>“Look,” Alice said a bit more firm this time, her hand following her words and squeezing Rio’s knee. “What can I do? What would make this better for you?”</p><p>“I dunno. Rewind time and prevent Ralph fucking Bohner from ever being born.”</p><p>“Well, my Time Machine is on the fritz right now but I’ll see what I can do.”</p><p>Rio smiled, a tentative ghost of a smile, but a smile all the same.</p><p>“I told Pepper to take out all the intimate scenes. No kissing, no cuddling, nothing remotely couple-y.”</p><p>Alice nodded slowly and moved her hand from Rio’s knee to her back, “In a big budget queer movie?”</p><p>Rio returned her head to her hands, “Jesus fuck.”</p><p>“Just something to keep in mind,” Alice said in such a soft voice that Rio wanted to smack her out of it. “Maybe you take them out for now but as shooting starts you can-…”</p><p>“Right,” Rio reasoned, though didn’t quite believe, “it’ll get easier. Maybe I’ll… yeah, yeah, okay.”</p><p>She felt scrambled again, torn between what was real and true and what could be, what should be, what she wanted.</p><p>The only thing that grounded her were her dad’s words from that morning: she had to take time. She had to let time heal as apparently it did. Though perhaps this wound wasn’t for healing.</p><p>Alice was rubbing her back now, being as gentle as she could with it, but Rio only wanted that gentleness she’d found in Agatha. She only wanted…</p><p>“When is our next day off?”</p><p>“Sunday,” Alice said with a slight lilt of surprise in her voice, “Next Sunday. So, dress rehearsals from tomorrow, which means-…”</p><p>“Over a week, Alice. I can do the math.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Rio fumbled the number around in her brain, let it stretch and sink and twist until it felt okay, until it felt <em>feasible</em>.</p><p>“I’ll get through the week and then… then I’ll speak to Agatha. Properly.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded, feeling choked suddenly, “If I speak to her now. If I find out how he-… if she tells me what happened that night, what <em>actually</em> happened I’ll <em>murder</em> him, or myself maybe. I don’t, I…”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice breathed out as she attempted to pull Rio into her arms, “Rio, maybe we-…”</p><p>But Rio shook her head, wiping furiously at the tears that had spilled over. “Don’t. Please. I don’t want to be touched.”</p><p>Alice dropped her hands immediately but remained close and even that felt too much for Rio. Her body couldn’t take any more hands on her that weren’t Agatha’s - and she’d promised herself she wouldn’t even have those, she’d even made Pepper take it out of the script.</p><p>Alice was silent as Rio cried into her hands, but disappeared to fetch a box of tissues and handed them over when it seemed like Rio had cried herself dry.</p><p>“A week. It’ll be busy, and Agatha isn’t the only one here. There’ll be plenty of distractions and plenty of-…”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>Alice shut right up and cautiously reached to rub Rio’s back again. “You’re not alone in this, Rio.”</p><p>She didn’t know how she could possibly tell good, kind, helpful Alice that she’d never felt more alone in her life. That even though she was sitting in a trailer made out of the love Alice had for her, even though her hand was now rubbing soft circles on her back, even though her phone contained evidence of all the people in her life who’d reached out, and the frames dotted about the place contained their smiles, she felt totally, utterly, alone.</p><p>But her feelings of isolation and <em>desolation</em> only got worse as morning turned to afternoon and her meeting with Pepper and Agatha loomed larger.</p><p>Alice walked with her to the room in the main studio building and left her at the door, which she knocked, received a “come in, Rio!”, and entered.</p><p>It was a larger space than she’d assumed, brighter too, with a large window at the back and soft furnishings in the centre, it could easily have been a <em>nice</em> room, if it weren’t for the two people now staring at her as she moved further in.</p><p>“Rio!” Pepper, friendly as ever, moved over to hug Rio and Rio reluctantly hugged her back. But over Pepper’s shoulder she watched the woman who hadn’t moved to greet her but watched her with tired, cautious eyes.</p><p>“Good, now we’re all here.”</p><p>Pepper pulled away and Rio hadn’t realised she’d been using her as a crutch to keep her from falling down at the sight of Agatha so she swayed a little as she did. Agatha had twitched in her chair but Rio had looked away and missed it.</p><p>“Sit, Rio. Do you want a water?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said as she took the seat opposite Agatha. “Fine, thanks.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>God, Pepper being peppy was really not what she needed right now.</p><p>Rio kept her gaze on Pepper though, because she could feel Agatha’s on her and she couldn’t handle meeting it.</p><p>Pepper looked expectantly at both actresses but when neither responded she cleared her throat and continued: “Let’s get started then, shall we?”</p><p>Neither responded. Rio dared to look at Agatha and saw in her face a similar pain to the one she felt in her chest, in her stomach, in the fingers that briefly stretched on the arm of her chair as if to reach for her.</p><p>“So, a few notes. I’ve spoken to Maria and she’s comfortable with making the accommodations.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and she looked away from Rio.</p><p>“First we have the car journey to the house. No issues there. Some handholding, so all good. Then the first kiss under the mistletoe at the door. We’re removing that.”</p><p>“Pardon me?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and dropped her chin to her chest.</p><p>“It’s,” Pepper began slowly, and Rio could only imagine what Agatha’s face looked like to make the positive Pepper falter a little. “Being replaced by a hug.”</p><p>“So we’re just going to hug under the mistletoe? That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Pepper tried again.</p><p>Rio looked up again, chewing on her lip now. Agatha was mutinous, her pale skin taught as she flexed and unflexed her jaw, clearly working something out.</p><p>“No that’s insane. Take the whole scene out. Who said no kissing?”</p><p>And maybe it was the look on Rio’s face or perhaps it was the way Pepper looked away but realisation dawned and Agatha said: “oh.”</p><p>She turned to Rio and raised her brows, her mouth still forming that perfect ‘o’ for a few seconds before she said in a soft voice: “You took it out?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her feet, wondering if there were any possible way to suddenly make herself disappear. “Well. I…”</p><p>“Agatha?” Pepper was trying her best. “There are no rights or wrongs to how we do this. We’re working to keep everyone comfortable and to aid the creative process, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened and then closed and then repeated. Rio looked up then looked away. She cleared her throat and trained her gaze on Pepper, hoping she’d break the ice that had swallowed the room.</p><p>But upon seeing her stricken face, Rio realised with a sinking heart that she wasn’t going to be much help.</p><p>“Agatha,” Pepper tried again.</p><p>“No, no, we’re a queer couple it’s important we kiss. I-…” but Agatha had stopped herself and Rio wondered if she’d been about to go on a tirade and had chosen to do this calmly instead for fear of unleashing on Rio similar to the day this had all begun.</p><p>Or maybe she’d just said the quiet part out loud.<em> “Queer couple”</em>.</p><p>Blue eyes flashed as they met Rio’s and for the briefest of moments Agatha no longer looked like the shell of her former self she’d been these past few days. She was once again confident, <em>arrogant</em>, and determined.</p><p>“People will want to see it,” she continued, “It’s important.”</p><p>Rio looked away, frustrated beyond belief at Agatha’s reasoning, though she knew it to be true even Alice had said it earlier. It <em>was</em> important they represented a happy, healthy, loving queer couple in what was sure to be one of the biggest movies of the year.</p><p>But, still, churning resentment and confused feelings made her mutter: “Since when do you care about my community?”</p><p>Movement in her periphery made her look up and she saw that Agatha now looked impossibly more furious and her hand was running through her hair, making it look wilder than even before.</p><p>“I think,” Pepper began cautiously, “that we’ve got off on the wrong foot.” She stood slowly and Rio watched in trepidation as she approached Agatha. The brunette flinched when Pepper reached out to her arm and Rio had to look away again, wondering if Agatha would have flinched if she’d been the one to reach out.</p><p>“Agatha’s right,” she said before either of the other two could speak again, “It’s important people see it. We need to hold hands and touch and kiss like any other happy couple. We have a platform, a duty to give that to people.”</p><p>She kept her gaze on her hands as she said this, on the fingers in her lap that were twisting and tugging, pulling at each other just so Rio could rid herself of some of her nervous energy.</p><p>“Okay,” Pepper said calmly, though she wasn’t one of the actresses in the room so Rio could hear the strain in her voice. “Rio, why don’t we talk about this in private?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said far faster than she meant to. “It’s fine. Put it back in.”</p><p>She looked up then and saw that Agatha had moved over to the window and had her back to her now as she stared out of it. The tension in the room was tangible still, and Agatha turning her back on it only made it worse.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t take her eyes off of her, didn’t even notice when Pepper came to sit by her and was muttering to herself about running everything through the studio’s HR.</p><p>And as Rio stared, as her eyes followed the line of Agatha’s legs, as she watched the light <em>tap</em>, <em>tap</em>, <em>tap</em> of the toes of her right foot on the floor, she realised something she’d never truly thought of before.</p><p>Her community was Agatha’s community.</p><p>It had always been Agatha’s community. She’d just never reached out to it, never let it embrace her, and never embraced it back.</p><p>She turned to Pepper still muttering beside her and softly asked, “Do you speak Spanish?”</p><p>“What?” Pepper looked up, all confusion and stress, “Oh. No. Do you need something, or-…?”</p><p>“No, don’t worry.”</p><p>Pepper smiled absently as she turned back to her notes and Rio cleared her throat as she looked back around at Agatha, still stood leaning against the windowsill.</p><p>“También es tu comunidad. Te acogerían. Te amarían.” <em>It’s your community too. They would embrace you. They would love you.</em></p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, and Rio saw her tense for a second before she turned to look at her over her shoulder. The cut of her jaw, the curve of her cheek, it was like crack to Rio. She longed to go to her and caress her face, to lean into her and feel her wrap around her, feel the hum of her throat as she kissed along it.</p><p>But no touching meant no touching.</p><p>And, besides, she wasn’t sure Pepper would appreciate the show.</p><p>“No necesito una comunidad.” <em>I don’t need a community.</em></p><p>“Is everything… alright?” Pepper asked carefully because she couldn’t understand what they were saying but she could hear the emotion in their voices.</p><p>“Lo necesitas.” <em>You need it.</em></p><p>Agatha’s jaw tensed more and Rio stood which made her turn properly, and Rio saw that she looked glassy eyed and she was now gripping the windowsill behind her so tightly her knuckles were white.</p><p>“Can we continue? I haven’t got all day.”</p><p>And she was gone again. Agatha had hidden herself once more.</p><p>Rio sat down, dropped her head down and held it in her hands, feeling the short strands that she still wasn’t used to as she ran her fingers through her hair.</p><p>“Okay, let’s, let’s take a breather and then we can go again.”</p><p>Rio nodded where she now rested her elbows on her thighs and kept her gaze down. She only knew Agatha had moved back over because she heard her come and take the seat opposite.</p><p>Pepper was flicking through the script she’d made notes on and Rio dared to look up. She saw Agatha watching her already, her eyes still glassy, her lower lip tugged between her teeth. But when she caught Rio’s eyes she turned away, visibly swallowed, and Rio felt her heart fall into her stomach.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha looked around at the sound of her name from Rio’s lips and Rio suddenly felt like she had nothing to say to her, at least nothing that would make this right. She shook her head a little, dropped her gaze again and found herself staring at the floor once more.</p><p>“Okay,” Pepper said riffling the sheets like a newscaster on a particularly bad news day.</p><p>“Eres tan terco.” <em>You're so stubborn.</em></p><p>“Rio perhaps we should speak in English now.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and looked up again. Agatha was looking away still, working her jaw as if she intended to break it.</p><p>“Okay,” Pepper tried again, taking Rio’s silence as agreement that they could continue, and in English this time.</p><p>“The next big scene is in the kitchen when-…”</p><p>“Actually, I don’t want to do this today. I’ll agree to whatever Rio is comfortable with.” Agatha stood up, her eyes trained on Pepper, “Whatever she wants.”</p><p>“Agatha,” both women tried, the blonde of the two following it up with, “The studio demands you have these sessions, Agatha.” Agatha was marching towards the door now, “It’s just agreeing to what we do in the scenes, it’s making everybody-“ Agatha had reached the door, “comfortable.” The door slammed behind her as she left.</p><p>“Well,” Pepper said as Rio stood up and began to mimic Agatha’s journey to the door, “that’s certainly never happened,” Rio reached the door, “before.” Rio slammed it on her way out.</p><p>To her surprise Agatha was just outside, her head against her hands as she leant against the wall and took long, deep, slow breaths. Rio watched in shock for a second and then moved silently and broke her rule by placing her hand against Agatha’s back.</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch like she had with Pepper.</p><p>“I just need a minute,” Agatha said quietly, her voice hoarse.</p><p>The door opened again and Pepper appeared in the hallway looking concerned, “Is everything-…?”</p><p>“Fine,” both Agatha and Rio said quickly. Pepper blinked, and only when Rio nodded at her did she nod back and disappear back into their room.</p><p>Rio’s hand had at some point curled into the fabric of Agatha’s sweater and she turned now to see the fist in the fabric and released it suddenly. “Do you need some water?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio pulled her hand away entirely and nodded but moved to stand against the wall beside Agatha, “I’ll just stand here then.”</p><p>It took a couple minutes but Agatha’s breathing slowly returned to normal and Rio felt her move beside her so turned to see Agatha had angled her head around to peek out at Rio from where it still rested against her hands.</p><p>“You don’t need to be here.”</p><p>“I’m preventing you from getting a huge fine from the studio.”</p><p>“I can handle a fine.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and for a fleeting moment she felt lightness surround them until Agatha had turned her head once more and was looking at her with those eyes. <em>God those eyes</em>.</p><p>Rio faltered, her body glitched, her mind blank because Agatha was still looking at her. She could feel her gaze flicker across her skin like an electric current pattering its way over her face, never settling, just constantly searching.</p><p>“Is it over?”</p><p>The current became dangerous suddenly.</p><p>“Do you want it to be?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha pushed herself off the wall and for a moment Rio thought she was going to turn, thought she was going to leave, but she simply stayed in place, tentatively reaching for Rio’s sleeve. “I’ve never wanted that.”</p><p><em>Then why did you sleep with your husband?</em></p><p><em>Why did you leave me?</em></p><p><em>Why did you say all those things?</em></p><p><em>Do you actually love me, Agatha?</em></p><p>“A funny way of showing that,” was what came out of her mouth instead. Barely a whisper but enough to make Agatha’s gaze drop. The downward tilt of her baby blues made the light that had been flickering in her irises stutter and then die.</p><p>Rio watched as she stared at her hand now clutching her sleeve, saw the tightness around her eyes that seemed to hold as she said, “Shout. Please. Shout at me. <em>Scream</em> at me. <em>Hit me.</em> But don’t-…”</p><p>“Hit you? Hit you?”</p><p>The second time Rio broke her rule was far worse than the first. Clutching at a loose sweater was one thing but stepping in and placing her hands on warm cheeks was entirely another.</p><p>But there was no stopping it. Rio wouldn’t have stopped for a stampede. The thundering of her heart wouldn’t let her. The blood boiling in her veins made her reckless.</p><p>But her hands, her hands were soft because they now held something precious in them again. Agatha had returned to them.</p><p>“Has he hit you?”</p><p>Some things aren’t consciously thought but done anyway: like breathing, like trying to tread water when drowning. And so Rio knew, instinctively, like a primal urge to stay alive, that if Agatha answered in the affirmative then she would kill Ralph Bohner.</p><p>She would gladly go down for his murder and spend the rest of her days in solitary confinement knowing that she’d put the bastard six feet under.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out, her hands now clutching at Rio’s wrists, stepping into her space.</p><p>“No. <em>Answer</em>. Answer the question.”</p><p>Agatha breathed in shakily, and Rio’s thumbs began to move of their own accord, tracing the familiar line of Agatha’s cheekbones.</p><p>“Agatha I swear. I <em>swear</em>.”</p><p>“He hasn’t. He… no he hasn’t.”</p><p>Rio searched Agatha’s features for any sign of a lie but knew she could hide it from her if she really wanted to. Still, she knew in her heart that given the opportunity she’d murder the husband. She’d destroy his stupid, smug…</p><p>“Stop being…”</p><p>Rio raised her brows a little at the familiar request. Her dad had been right. Agatha had never had care thrown at her in her life, she’d never experienced the touch of someone who considered her to be worth gentleness, worth everything.</p><p>But the truth was more complicated than that because Rio felt far from gentle. She felt far from able to protect Agatha let alone show her the care she used to or that Agatha clearly needed.</p><p>She felt useless, pathetic, and like nothing, though she <em>felt</em> everything.</p><p>Her thumbs still tracing that same pattern over warm cheeks suddenly felt a tear beneath them, “Just please fight me. Please scream or-…”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, felt Agatha tug at her, and when she opened them again Agatha was crying properly, silently, her face broken beneath Rio’s still gentle hold. “Why won’t you fight?”</p><p>“That’s not how this works, Agatha.”</p><p>“I don’t-… I don’t understand-… how are you not-… how is this not tearing you apart?”</p><p>Rio laughed then, a fake sound that seemed to rattle Agatha even as it pained Rio. “You think you haven’t broken me? You think Alice is staying in my house to keep me company? You don’t think that every time I see you I want to forgive you and let you crush me again and again?”</p><p>Her hold dropped and Agatha’s tightened, “How do you not see what you’ve done to me?”</p><p>“Rio I… I know I’ve… please…”</p><p>“I haven’t shouted because-…” and Rio thought she’d have to fight her off but she simply let go the moment Rio’s hands crossed over covered hers on her sleeves. “Because I… I can’t process the… Jesus, Agatha!”</p><p>She stumbled backwards, tripping over her own feet god knows how and landing unceremoniously, <em>pathetically</em>, on her ass. Agatha lurched forwards in an attempt to catch her before she fell but missed by a fraction of an inch.</p><p>It was so humiliating that Rio thought she’d blacked out for a second. But then strong arms were around her and she was being heaved up to her feet again and before she could question it she was standing once more before Agatha, her waist held, her coccyx aching.</p><p>And because Agatha held her, because she was warm and Rio didn’t want her to see her face, she pressed herself into her and the third time she broke her rule she broke it totally and utterly.</p><p>Standing in the middle of a corridor in the depths of a studio building, Rio Vidal gave herself over to Agatha Harkness.</p><p>If only Pepper could witness the intimacy on display; the way Agatha ducked her head down to hide herself against Rio’s throat, the way Rio buried her hands and her nose in Agatha’s hair and breathed her in properly for the first time since Agatha had told her the truth about London.</p><p>It was inconceivable that Rio could ever get over Agatha now. It seemed laughable that she had even considered that one day she might be able to say Agatha’s name or see her on the side of buses or on billboards and not yearn, not feel the pang of lost love.</p><p>Because as Agatha held her more tight than she ever had before she knew she needed answers more than she needed the time to heal, to process, to mourn what she’d lost.</p><p>Turning her face down she felt the heat radiating off of Agatha as she remained hidden against her, felt her breath so tantalisingly close to her lips, felt the need more than ever to turn fully and kiss her. But this one thing she managed to hold back on.</p><p>She inhaled sharply when Agatha turned into her and for a second she almost lost her one last thread of self control. They raised their heads together, and Rio’s hand fell back to Agatha’s cheek, her thumb just pressing on the corner of her lips, providing a slight barrier to stop her closing the distance fully.</p><p>Rio swallowed, watched with hooded eyes as Agatha turned the inch needed to kiss the pad of her thumb, watched as she turned back, nuzzled their noses together, breathed out heavily, hotly against her own parted lips.</p><p>“Agatha,” she choked out, her throat catching on the second syllable as if trying to prevent her from saying out loud the name of the person she wanted so desperately now. “Next Sunday. When we can have a full day together… We can talk.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed and Rio’s thumb brushed in a downwards swipe, pressing against the pillow of her lower lip. She watched as Agatha kissed her there again, almost enveloping her the tip of her thumb with her upper lip.</p><p>“I want,” she tried, shifting a little as she pulled her thumb away, “I want you to tell me everything and… and be ready to. I can’t take-…” she released a breath and Agatha looked up at her, purposefully nudging their noses together again. “I can’t take anymore secrets.”</p><p>Agatha only nodded against her and Rio worried she wasn’t speaking because she didn’t want to promise something she couldn’t deliver.</p><p>But then Rio became distracted again, her mind torn between agony and giving up. And she looked, she properly looked at Agatha’s face. Her gaze swept over her makeup free, pale skin, danced along the barely there lines beside her eyes, at the downwards turn of her soft lips.</p><p>Up close Agatha looked more than exhausted, she looked bone-tired, and Rio wondered how she was still standing. She took a breath, and then said before she could think, “Did you sleep? Did you… did you take your pills last night?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head again, and Rio realised she was leaning more into her, and was being careful not to scare her hands away as they continued to cradle her face.</p><p>“You need to sleep,” she said quietly, feeling her voice crack beneath the strain of the hurt. “Agatha you’ll… you’ll make yourself…”</p><p>The sensation of it was magnificent; how her heart could be so broken and yet so alight with pain all in one go. Because Agatha wasn’t able to sleep without her, or without the medication she took to switch her brain off. And when she did sleep, at least without Rio, whatever haunted her steps, haunted her dreams.</p><p>She watched her for a second longer, took in all that was Agatha Harkness, tried to reason with herself, to fight off the urge to do what she so desperately wanted to do next. And Rio was a fighter, but she lost this battle.</p><p>She pulled away, dropped her hands from Agatha’s warm face, and kept her gaze on her as she shrugged herself out of her cardigan. It was warm and soft in her hand as she held it out to Agatha, no, pressed it to her chest. It wasn’t a gift, it was a lifeline. It had to be given.</p><p>“Take it. I know… I…” <em>I know you like to be close.</em></p><p>She shook her head as she lost the ability to speak and Agatha’s left hand curled around her own on the cardigan.</p><p>“I… don’t deserve it.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, felt the pain again as fresh as ever flare up in her chest. But Agatha had the cardigan now. She had the piece of clothing that would smell like Rio, that would hopefully help her to sleep, and so she pulled away again.</p><p>She stepped back and in doing so felt the horror of being separated from Agatha once more.</p><p>But Rio stepped around her to head back inside and found Agatha had grasped her wrist and stopped her on her way. She turned to her, saw the way she still flushed the grey cardigan to her chest, saw the panic in her eyes. “I can’t go back in. I can’t be told what-… I just can’t be told how to touch you. Not by someone who isn’t you. Take out whatever you need, change whatever makes you comfortable. I’ll take whatever fine they give me for not finishing the session but I can’t be in there.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the hand that held her cardigan and saw the ring it wore glinting back up at her. It was somehow more offensive than seeing Ralph’s ring there. It looked like an empty promise.</p><p>A promise of something Rio could never actually have.</p><p>Something dark and angry inside of her wanted to tell Agatha it wasn’t her ring, that Alice had picked it, and to see just a modicum of the hurt that it might induce in the sea of Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>But she couldn’t bring herself to do it.</p><p>Not when Agatha didn’t think she even deserved the cardigan she currently held like it was her salvation.</p><p>She raised her gaze slowly upwards and saw that far from desperate, Agatha was now looking pale again, sick again.</p><p>Her lips parted and Rio looked down to them, remembered how they felt against her skin, against her own lips, and for a second forgot that she had ever been angry, or that she was even hurt.</p><p>Her hesitation allowed Agatha to tug her back a little, and when her next words came, the pain came back with them:</p><p>“I know you asked me not to say it but if it’s going to be over a week until I can explain then I need to tell you that I love you. I’m in love with you. And I think I’ve been in love with you from the very first time I laid eyes on you. I had Nicky and he has been my <em>joy</em> and the universe or whatever god there is gave me one extra piece of joy in my shitty, miserable life. Because he made my son look like you. I believe Lilia when she says… when she says he looks like you because his mother loves you. I know you need time and I want to give you it but I’m so frightened that time will mean… just please, <em>please</em> know how in love with you I am.”</p><p>Every time she said it. Every single time the words ‘I love you’ came tumbling out of Agatha’s mouth it felt like she was being stabbed. The pain was so intoxicating that even as the blade twisted in her chest she felt the need to press into it, just to feel more of Agatha.</p><p>“I need,” she sucked in a breath, “I need time.”</p><p>“I’m scared to give it to you.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, felt the twist of her sleeve as Agatha tightened her grip, “I know, Agatha. But I have to ask you for it anyway.”</p><p>Someone flickered and died in Agatha’s gaze then. It was something like reluctance, gasping its last before it perished and in sea glass there was now something like consideration, something biddable, and no longer as petrified.</p><p>Agatha nodded, one firm conclusion. She’d give it, because Rio had asked.</p><p>“Sunday,” Rio said slowly, watching as Agatha’s gaze fell from her again and landed where she now held her wrist. “I’ll come over in the morning and… we can discuss it.”</p><p>Agatha was silent still and Rio reached to take the hand that held her but held her loosely, as if keeping her there weren’t the aim, just holding on was all she wanted to do.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She looked up and Rio almost lost her breath at the sight of her looking so lost and so scared.</p><p>“Nicky will be with me. I’d send him to Jen but…”</p><p>“I’ll come over later then. I’ll come after he’s in bed.”</p><p>Agatha nodded again, that one sharp nod that told Rio she was finding words difficult.</p><p>“It <em>is</em> tearing me apart, Agatha. Which is why I need the week. I need time to… I don’t know. Think. Try not to want to die.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t nod this time.</p><p>She instead sucked in a soft breath and Rio felt her hold change. Her hand twisted further round her wrist and she was tugging her back close until Rio had taken a step forwards and Agatha had too.</p><p>It was so easy to fall into her, to allow her to bring her in. And telling her talking wasn’t necessary, that they could work through it by simply ignoring it, suddenly felt easy too.</p><p>But Agatha was swallowing thickly, her chin raising an inch or two as she spoke, “If you change your mind, will you tell me? If at any point… day or night you want to come over then… please, Rio. I’m so sorry. I want to explain. I want… Quiero ser buena para ti.” <em>I want to be good for you.</em></p><p>Rio felt the hollowness in her chest again, but before she could respond the door opened and Agatha didn’t let go but Rio turned and saw Pepper standing there, looking awkwardly between the two of them, her gaze briefly settling on where Agatha held Rio’s wrist and where she still held the cardigan that Rio had been wearing earlier.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I… is everyone okay?”</p><p>“It’s fine. It’s fine.”</p><p>Pepper nodded and Rio felt Agatha release her wrist and she turned to see that her eyes, now far from Agatha’s own and instead those of the <em>actress</em> Agatha Harkness, were instead on Pepper.</p><p>“I’ll take the fine. And I’ll do whatever Rio wants.”</p><p>Agatha turned without a second glance in Rio’s direction and Rio was left standing there, watching as Agatha marched away from her down the hallway.</p>

<p>It became a habit, calling Miguel every morning, and every night.</p><p>Rio knew he’d be telling Anna everything but she didn’t really care. Her dad knew. And he was calm and patient and occasionally said things she knew had been given to him to say by her mom.</p><p>But those things helped too.</p><p><em>Everything</em> he said helped. He listened so well and was silent with her when she needed to be silent but silent <em>with</em> someone.</p><p>He was soft with her and softer even with Agatha.</p><p>And she loved him more than she could say for that latter thing. Because Alice listened when she spoke, and was silent when she wanted silence, but she wasn’t soft on Agatha. Sometimes she needed her <em>not</em> to be, but sometimes, and that <em>sometimes</em> was becoming more and more frequent, she needed her to be.</p><p>So, Rio always felt a little more clear after speaking to her dad. The clarity didn’t last long but it was important that it was there.</p><p>Exactly three conversations with Miguel and two nights sleep since that first day on set after the doomed meeting with Pepper and Agatha, Rio didn’t see Agatha at all.</p><p> </p><p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p><p>It was the Saturday, the first day of semi-rehearsals. A day where Rio was mostly kept to Costume or Makeup. A day where she saw a few people from the cast but was mostly involved with the crew.</p><p>She knew Agatha was there, but that she was keeping away. During the one hour of the day where she didn’t need to be somewhere or try something on, she sat with some of the rest of the cast, but Agatha didn’t show up even show up then. But Rio felt the spectre of her the whole time.</p><p>Jen had approached her on her way back to her trailer after an afternoon of more costume tests and told her she’d been running lines privately with Lilia. But she’d also told her she’d slept, not for long, but that Agatha had had at least four hours sleep.</p><p>Upon hearing the news, Rio even found it within herself to congratulate Jen on the impending move with Alice. Jen had responded by pulling her in for a hug so tight that it had taken Rio a while to respond.</p><p>But she had.</p><p>And when she went home that night she cried for the first time in a while because the only way Agatha would have slept was with her cardigan.</p><p> </p><p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p><p>It was the next day that she finally saw Agatha again: precisely a week before she was going to rock up to Agatha’s house to talk.</p><p>The set was quiet and Rio had arrived early in her little hybrid with Alice in tow to get breakfast at crafty with Billy. But she’d seen Agatha just two trailers down, standing with Jen and she’d stopped so suddenly that Alice slammed into her back.</p><p>In the morning light Agatha looked like her old self. Her features were softened so she didn’t look as tired or drawn. Her shoulders were back, confident, and her eyes were focused solely on Rio.</p><p>“We can go say hi if you want?”</p><p>Rio twitched at Alice’s words, her body simply agreeing before her mind could catch up.</p><p>But she turned a second later, turned to open her own door, to hide away from those blue eyes.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“No, Alice.”</p><p>“You don’t want to talk about the fact that you’ll be locked in a room with her today doing acting exercises and running lines?”</p><p>Rio was in the small kitchen area now, making a coffee in the French press, though she’d just put her other coffee down on the side. “I’ll pair with Billy for them.”</p><p>“C’mon, babe. You’re smarter than that. You know you’ll be with Agatha.”</p><p>Rio just shook her head a little and folded over the coffee bag. “I can’t do trust exercises with her.”</p><p>“You don’t think she’ll catch you?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Glancing over at her friend now kneeling up on the couch she saw Alice smiling. “Ass.”</p><p>Alice laughed and settled back onto her ankles, “So I have to ask you something.”</p><p>“Mm? Coffee?”</p><p>“No. I have to ask you how you’d feel about a lunch date with James, Maria, and Agatha.”</p><p>Rio stared at the plunger and before she’d even put water in it she started to push it slowly down.</p><p>“Babe? Rio? There’s no water in that. Babe?”</p><p>Rio didn’t stop until it was all the way pressed and she was simply compressing the fine grains of arabica grounds in a firm, dry disk. “When?”</p><p>“Tomorrow.”</p><p>“On set?”</p><p>“Yeah. Informal. He’s coming for rehearsals and Maria is keen you feel like a family.”</p><p>Rio scoffed more bitterly than she meant to and zoned out so much that she jumped when suddenly Alice’s hand was on her own as it continued to press down the now totally compressed coffee.</p><p>“Yesterday was a good day. And what did your dad say this morning?”</p><p>“Un día a la vez.” <em>One day at a time.</em></p><p>Rio closed her eyes but all she could see was Agatha in the morning sun, watching her as she arrived so she opened them again and Agatha was gone. And she asked the thing that she’d asked her dad already that morning: “What if, when we talk, it’s clear she can’t move forward with me?”</p><p>Alice’s hold changed then and she turned Rio to pull her down into a hug. “Well then she’s a moron and a fucking loser. An even bigger one than she currently is.</p><p>Rio exhaled a half laugh into Alice’s shoulder but neither of them said anything else about it. Alice instead finished making Rio her third coffee of the day, though it was barely nine in the morning.</p><p>And Rio lost herself in the rhythm of throwing the little basketballs into the hoop, collecting them again, and throwing them right back.</p><p>By the time she was sitting in a room full of her fellow actors, chaperoned as always by the enthusiastic Billy Kaplan, she didn’t feel any better. Yesterday, not seeing Agatha, had been a strange kind of floating day.</p><p>She’d floated above it all, on another plane of existence where nothing really hurt but nothing really mattered. Only now, when she was to be locked in a room with her doing trust exercises and various acting exercises, did the pain really hit again.</p><p>Everything hurt and everything mattered.</p><p>“You smell good,” Billy whispered to her as the leader of the pack - an acting coach hired by the studio named Sue - began her spiel about trust and communication being the most important things about delivering a good and true performance. “What’re you wearing?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, having zoned out a little and conscious only of the fact that Agatha had yet to arrive. “Uh, a perfume Alice got me years ago. Supposed to be wearing Versace but it’s something fancy. And French.”</p><p>“Rio? Could we have your attention please?”</p><p>Rio started and cleared her throat but nodded and nudged Billy accusingly.</p><p>“As I was saying,” Sue began again but was interrupted once more because the door opened and the twelve or so actors in the room turned to see Agatha Harkness stepping inside.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late, I didn’t want to be here.”</p><p>There was a light tittering of laughter, like a murmur of swallows fluttering in the early morning. It was always a surprise to Rio just how magnetic Agatha was. Perhaps because for so long she’d been right at the epicentre of that field of magnetism. But now, as she watched her saunter in, unbothered and unabashed about her distain for something she clearly thought was beneath her, she was struck by it once more.</p><p>Agatha, in her soft white button down, came to take a spot behind Rio, so close that Rio could smell her perfume, could feel her gaze on the back of her head as she turned around to focus in again on Sue.</p><p>“Right, I… yes. Where was I? That’s right.”</p><p>The spiel went on for another fifteen minutes until it was announced that they were all to walk in a random pattern around the room. Avoiding crashing into each other was the aim. Walking as their natural self was the simple ask.</p><p>Rio had done plenty of this sort of thing in her youth. She lived for this sort of thing. The joy of the collective, the embrace of the group as they fumbled and laughed and improvised together, she found it healing.</p><p>Or at least, used to.</p><p>Everyone was on their feet because god forbid an actor reject the chance to show off their instrument.</p><p>Rio began to walk, focusing on the task at hand, when she turned sharply she saw Agatha, alone in the set of seats that had been laid out for them all. She was leaning back, her legs crossed and her arms crossed over her body, one vertical where her fingers toyed with her lower lip. It was as Rio walked towards her, the route surprisingly clear, that she saw just how shattered she was.</p><p>Sue approached her but Rio had to turn to avoid crashing into Peter Quill and was suddenly distracted by the hand on her waist that was unnecessary and unwelcome.</p><p>By the time she’d done another loop of the space she saw that Sue had left Agatha alone and Agatha simply sat there, watching. It made Rio <em>actually</em> crash this time. Only she didn’t mind Lilia’s hands on her as much as she minded Quill’s.</p><p>“Watch it, dear. Can’t get distracted there.”</p><p>Rio smiled weakly, glanced across at Agatha again and saw that she was still watching, and then turned back to Lilia, “Sorry. Won’t happen again.”</p><p>“Oh I don’t believe you for a second.”</p><p>Rio moved on then, deciding for her own safety as well as others that she simply wouldn’t look at Agatha any longer.</p><p>It lasted all of five minutes.</p><p>Sue had called for everyone to stop where they were, for them all to pair up with whoever was closest - which for Rio was Quill. Only suddenly it wasn’t.</p><p>A soft brush against her sleeve told her that someone had moved even closer and she turned just in time to see Agatha standing there, her eyes not on Rio, but on Quill.</p><p>“I’m sure we can share her,” he said good-naturedly, though if Agatha’s stiff jaw told Rio anything it was that she didn’t want to share.</p><p>“Anyone ever told you you’re an ass, Quill?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and moved away from Agatha slightly and closer to Quill.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand follow her to her side, her fingers curling into the fabric of her sweater. It felt good, after everything that had happened, that Agatha was still protective, still <em>possessive</em>, and Rio found herself leaning into her a little despite the fact she’d just moved away.</p><p>“Love it when you talk dirty, Harkness. That husband of yours enjoy that mouth?”</p><p>“What I do with my mouth is no business of yours, Quill.”</p><p>At her side, Rio felt Agatha’s knuckles press into her.</p><p>“Wouldn’t mind if it were, though.”</p><p>He stepped closer and Rio felt Agatha stiffen and her hold on her sweater tighten as Rio moved a little in front of her. She couldn’t help but raise her shoulders a little, unconsciously giving herself another inch in height, allowing the constantly crackling fire of her anger to burn her sense away as she accused: “Trying to flirt with a married woman, Quill? Come on.”</p><p>“Still set on the girl thing, Vidal?” Peter, charming and handsome, but idiotic and sexist, tried his luck on Rio now, grinning crookedly at her. “Why don’t you flirt with her a little, see if you can make use of those beds in the trailers. I’d happily watch. Check for the chemis-…”</p><p>Maybe it was that the last few days had been the worst days of Rio’s life. Maybe it was that Quill had already pissed her off at the table read with his stupid comments in front of the kid. Maybe it was that Agatha had changed her hold to her other hip and was tugging her back. Maybe it was that she’d been plagued by visions of Agatha’s mouth on Ralph.</p><p>Maybe it was just that she needed to hit something.</p><p>So she hit Peter Quill.</p><p>It wasn’t the hardest she’d ever hit someone, but it wasn’t exactly soft either.</p><p>She got him square in the nose, a quick <em>pop</em> against the bridge, and he stumbled back a little as Rio was pulled back into Agatha and held firm against her.</p><p>“Rio, no, no-…”</p><p>The room went silent, and Rio could hear only her heartbeat, and feel only Agatha.</p><p>Her arms were crossed over her body, her left from her side to her right shoulder, her right angling down to her hip. It felt protective, like she was worried Rio would get hit, rather than worried Rio would hit again.</p><p>Agatha’s warm breath was against her cheek, and she felt her gasp quietly and pull her back more when Peter brought his hand up and with curious fingers he touched the nose he now scrunched experimentally. It looked like it stung, and Rio was glad at least of that.</p><p>“Ouch,” he muttered, briefly looking like the hurt was getting worse as his eyes watered and he looked at Rio, his jaw flexing slightly. “Suppose I deserved that.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered urgently, tugging her back with her a couple more steps as Sue called for order and Lilia stepped between the puncher and her victim.</p><p>“Let me see,” Lilia instructed, making Peter tilt his head back so she could check if he were bleeding.</p><p>Rio regretted that he wasn’t. She regretted that she’d been neglecting her body by drinking too much coffee and eating not enough food. She was weaker than she usually would be. Tired and ineffectual.</p><p>A week ago she’d have broken his nose no problem.</p><p>But then Agatha’s arms constricted around her, forcing her to come back to herself, and she turned her head just an inch, and everything was Agatha, so her anger died with the brush of her nose against her cheek, and she felt only shame.</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“Is everyone okay? What happened?”</p><p>Sue was back again, but Rio was distracted by Agatha now trying to turn her around, and when she managed it Rio was surprised by what she saw. Agatha looked pale and surprised but her hands were checking her over, as if she’d missed the part where Quill had attacked Rio too.</p><p>She dropped her hold to first check her hands, she then moved up her arms, held her neck, held her cheeks. It was frantic and soft and Rio couldn’t breath as Agatha stared at her, trying still to find where Rio was hurt, and see what she could fix.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio managed to whisper, feeling a shiver overtake her body as Agatha tried to search for the lie in her brown eyes.</p><p>“Let’s all take a break,” Sue announced quite quickly after she realised no one was going to tell her what happened. Only a few people had seen what Rio had done and Quill wasn’t exactly anyone’s favourite in the room.</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze from Rio to glance over at Quill and then looked back again at Rio, her hands sliding back down until they found her hands again. “Come outside?”</p><p>But Rio’s whole body was vibrating now as the after affects of the adrenaline rush kicked in. Agatha only stepped a little closer, turned her head to kiss her cheek, squeezed the fingers that had just punched one of their fellow cast members.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>She knew she was trying to reassure her, knew she was trying to bring her back down from the upper echelons at the very edge of her sanity. But she was struggling now to make sense of what she’d allowed herself to do, of how she’d lost it so quickly and cleanly that she’d assaulted a fellow actor for the crime of being a pig.</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha’s words against her cheek, could feel the lips that had been there now up against her brow, and she only had the ability to turn her hand over and lock fingers with Agatha, the only acknowledgement that she could give that she was still in there somewhere.</p><p>“Show’s over, everybody! Haven’t you heard of a little thing we like to call ‘stage craft’? Focus on your own partners, please!”</p><p>Lilia was shouting somewhere near her, warning people off what was left of the scene, making them all turn around for fear that Lilia Calderu would blacklist them from Hollywood altogether if they didn’t.</p><p>Rio would have been grateful, but gratitude was lost on her when she realised what the hardness in Agatha’s hand was and she glanced down to see the ring she’d given her shining back up at her.</p><p>“I’ll take her,” Lilia offered a second later, having left Quill now putting on a brave face despite the sting of his nose to stand beside Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“Agatha, stay here.”</p><p>Rio watched as Agatha looked momentarily stuck for what to say but then Lilia was tugging her away from her and Agatha let go, watching as Rio was led from the room by the woman in the shawls.</p><p>Rio was shivering again until she was out in the corridor, a good twenty feet from the door and Lilia had turned to her with a look that made Rio want to shrink down and die.</p><p>“You stupid girl!”</p><p>Rio flinched and in flinching she realised what she’d actually done.</p><p>“You <em>cannot</em> go around smacking people in the face when they say something idiotic.”</p><p>Rio grimaced and looked down at her feet, only vaguely aware that a door was opening somewhere near by.</p><p>“I didn’t break it.”</p><p>“Do you want a medal for that?”</p><p>Rio huffed as a voice said, “Are you okay?”</p><p>Glancing up again she saw Agatha, looking more concerned than angry, and reaching out to take her hand.</p><p>“The two of you,” Lilia was saying sharply, though she’d lowered her voice this time round, “Need to sort yourselves out. Rio can’t go round smacking people and Agatha, you can’t lock yourself away and hope no one will notice. You’re number one on the call sheet.”</p><p>Rio could hear Lilia, she could understand what she was saying, but her knuckles were suddenly against Agatha’s lips, and so she couldn’t really compute her words, not properly anyway.</p><p>“Are you listening to me?”</p><p>Agatha turned to Lilia, but held on tight still to Rio’s right hand. “He deserved it.”</p><p>“Punching people is-…”</p><p>“It won’t happen again.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to her as she’d made her promise and Rio had to fight the urge not to look at her because she was so close now, so visibly concerned that Rio was somehow hurt.</p><p>Only when Agatha’s hand was back on her cheek did Rio have no choice but to look up at her and in doing so she collapsed back an inch or two against the wall. Agatha only followed. She tilted her head and for a second Rio thought she might kiss her but then Lilia was breaking them apart.</p><p>“Go back inside.”</p><p>Neither of them looked away from the other but Rio nodded just once and Agatha reluctantly pivoted and marched back down to the door. She turned when she reached it and Rio smiled sadly at the sight of her looking back.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Lilia said firmly once the door was closed again, “We both know <em>he</em> is not the man you want to smack.”</p><p>Rio blinked and turned slowly to look at Lilia, “What?”</p><p>“Ralph. You want to smack Ralph.”</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“There’s no use. It’s just us. But I’m telling you now, smacking anybody will not make things easier for either of you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and looked back towards the door where Agatha would be just inside with that idiot. She wanted to smack everyone now. Just to feel something. Just to feel something other than the hurt that haunted her.</p><p>“Rio, you’re a smart girl. She’s a smart girl. When are you going to sort this out?”</p><p>“Sunday. We’re talking on Sunday.”</p><p>She turned back and saw Lilia analysing her closely, “Are you ready for it?”</p><p>“Does smacking someone in the middle of my working day make it look like I am?”</p><p>Lilia pursed her lips and Rio slumped back against the wall.</p><p>“He was an ass.”</p><p>“I heard what he said, I know.”</p><p>“He deserved it.”</p><p>“Doesn’t mean you should have done it.”</p><p>“I’d do it again if-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Lilia said in a softer voice this time, “If Agatha wants to protect her son, then you need to be there to catch her. If anyone gets wind of <em>any</em> violence…”</p><p>“I’m not violent! I just… Jesus fuck.”</p><p>“Look, I don’t know everything but I do know if she leaves that man and you want to be with her then you need to keep your hands to yourself and that temper under control.”</p><p>Rio rocked her head back against the wall and closed her eyes. She knew Lilia was right. She knew she shouldn’t have punched Quill but the idea of anyone making comments like that made her blood boil and her hands form fists.</p><p>“I don’t have a temper. I’m not a child.”</p><p>She almost choked on the last word though, because Agatha maybe thought she was. Perhaps what she’d done is just solidify Agatha’s accusation.</p><p>Agatha wanted to make sure she was okay, sure. But she didn’t want her as a partner. Not when Nicky was there.</p><p>And maybe, maybe, Agatha actually thought Rio would hit her. That’s why she’d asked two days ago. Because she thought it was a possibility.</p><p>That Rio might hit her.</p><p>She covered her face, an old habit from childhood; if she couldn’t see anyone, no one could see her.</p><p>The woman she loved had asked her to hit her, rather than not speak to her. And Rio, childish, immature Rio, had just hit someone else in front of her. It was a cruel joke of the universe, really. That Rio had been unable to control herself at the crucial moment where Agatha’s fears could either be confirmed or denied.</p><p>It made her feel sick that the words had even left Agatha’s mouth in the first place, but now she was sick with the fear that Agatha could potentially believe Rio would have it in her to use the hands that had been made to worship Agatha harm her instead.</p><p>“Whatever you’re thinking,” Lilia said from somewhere before her, “it’s not true.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but remained hidden.</p><p>“That girl in there… well I’ve known her a long time. She isn’t soft. She doesn’t hold or protect or care for anyone other than her son. And then you come along and suddenly she’s moving differently through the world. You’ve changed her. People like Agatha don’t change. But you’ve done it. I believe in many things, Rio Vidal, and one of the things I believe in is that some people were just made for each other. Not everyone was made for someone. But you were made for Agatha. I saw it the first time we met in Cannes. It’s written right there,” she took Rio’s left hand and traced her finger along her palm, “right there, etched into your very skin.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the place Lilia’s finger rested and remembered a time months ago when she’d done the exact same thing in a loud, busy party in the middle of the Cannes Film Festival. She’d seen nothing then and she saw nothing now.</p><p>“She needs you to be steady for her. And flying off the handle well-…”</p><p>“She was right,” Rio said quickly, raising her gaze to meet Lilia’s shrewd dark eyes, “It won’t happen again.”</p><p>Lilia nodded, sizing her up for a second, until she released her hand, “Let’s go back in. Indulge this crazed blonde with the idea that any of us need help with acting.”</p><p>They exchanged soft smiles, Lilia’s a little more broad than Rio’s as she nodded in the direction of the door and Rio obliged the silent instruction and took a breath as she went.</p><p>When Rio came back into the room she was relieved that no one even looked her way. She was an Oscar-winner with charm for days, but she wasn’t Agatha Harkness. She couldn’t command attention simply by showing up like she could.</p><p>Only she <em>could</em> command Agatha’s attention. From the corner of the room, resting against the opposite wall, standing before Billy, Agatha was watching her. She was scanning her over  for any signs of hurt that she might have missed before.</p><p>And Rio could only look away for fear that she’d do or say something stupid. She joined the fray once more and saw Quill look over at her, saw him assess for a second before he winked and gave her that crooked smile again.</p><p>It meant he wasn’t angry, but she could also bet it meant he’d have no problem being an ass once more. Only this time she wouldn’t be able to hit him because of it.</p><p>But she smiled back, mouthed a silent, “sorry, dude”, and received only a fake punch to his own nose and an exaggerated mime of him stumbling back and ricocheting his head off of nothing in return.</p><p>She hated that guy.</p><p>But dumb meant he wouldn’t be pressing charges, so maybe she didn’t hate him as much as she could have done.</p><p>She’d come back into the middle of the same exercise and found that half the people around her were currently falling back or stumbling, depending on how much trust they had in their partner.</p><p>Her feet took her closer to Agatha even though her brain told her to walk in any other direction. But Billy was there too, so maybe her body just knew something her brain couldn’t yet comprehend.</p><p>“I’m stronger than I look,” Billy tried, in a tone that sounded an awful lot like pleading to Rio. He looked desperate, hoping he’d get his dream of Agatha trusting him enough to fall into his arms. Platonically, of course.</p><p>Rio caught Agatha roll her eyes and had to look away for fear she’d laugh and upset Billy. Once sure she could control herself she stepped up and placed a hand on Billy’s shoulder to get him to stop his unsubtle begging.</p><p>And once again her body took over before her brain could catch up.</p><p>“Let me. I’ll catch you.”</p><p>Agatha looked directly at her, and Rio felt unsure suddenly.</p><p>What if she dropped Agatha? What if she let her slip through her fingers?</p><p>Or worse.</p><p>What if Agatha said no?</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Billy looked aghast and as Agatha eyed the distance between them and turned around to get into position, Billy whispered urgently into Rio’s ear, “I’ve been asking for the past ten minutes if she’d let me.”</p><p>Rio only smiled a little at the young actor and moved to where Agatha would need her to be.</p><p>Agatha turned once, checked she was there, and then looked back forwards again.</p><p>There she stood.</p><p>Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p>Back ramrod straight.</p><p>Hair flowing down her back in graceful waves.</p><p>More talent in her little finger than anyone else in the room had in their entire body.</p><p>And she fell, light as a feather, stiff as a board, into Rio’s waiting arms.</p><p>She caught her effortlessly, Agatha’s head now against her chest, her body gently cradled and supported by Rio’s own. Agatha had released a soft gasp upon contact and Rio had not made any noise at all.</p><p>She held her, suspended between herself, her heels, and the ground for a few seconds, and then she raised her back up. She didn’t hover close or crowd her but Agatha turned around to her when Rio’s arms slipped from their favourite resting place.</p><p>There was a faint blush across pale cheeks.</p><p>“Now,” a voice near Rio announced, “isn’t that the thing.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Lilia and saw her smiling indulgently at Agatha and as she turned back to her she saw that Agatha was avoiding Lilia’s gaze but looking, as ever, at Rio.</p><p>“There!” Sue shouted with a clap of her hands, “Perfect! Everybody! As easy as breathing! Agatha, Rio, please, indulge us. Do it again.”</p><p>It was ironic, really, in Alanis’ definition: how a year ago, maybe less, Rio would have <em>jumped</em> at the chance to show off to the room that not only did Agatha Harkness trust her enough to let her catch her, but she, little Rio Vidal was the only one who could.</p><p>But now Rio couldn’t imagine anything worse than showing off about Agatha trusting her, about being able to catch her.</p><p>She wanted only to hold her in her arms and to be alone, so alone that neither of them were even aware that anyone else on the planet existed apart from them.</p><p>“Shall we indulge?”</p><p>Then again, if Agatha wanted her to, she sure as hell would show off about it.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow at her, just slightly, barely a millimetre, but certainly a check, an “okay?” for Rio’s gentle “okay”.</p><p>Rio nodded and bit the corner of her lip. Agatha’s gaze dropped to the movement and then she turned away and Rio stepped back and prepared for the fall.</p><p>It happened again, beautifully, easily, and this time Rio was the one to gasp and Agatha was silent.</p><p>Rio held on a little longer as the crowd cheered and she lifted Agatha back up, and this time, this time Agatha spun around before Rio’s arms were again her own.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal everybody! Showing everyone how it’s done!”</p><p>But Agatha’s arms were around her neck, and Rio was now holding on for dear life.</p><p>Only Agatha wasn’t falling anymore. She was instead holding her so tight Rio felt like she’d never let go.</p><p>It was her chance. Her one chance to say something to Agatha. She had to make sure she knew, had to reassure if there was even the tiniest part of Agatha that would ever be worried about it. Because the woman in her arms was precious, <em>beyond</em> precious. She had to know that. Even if they would never work. Even if Rio had had all the joy of having Agatha she’d ever be allowed.</p><p>Even if Rio would be alone forever with her memories and the ghost of Agatha in her arms.</p><p>Agatha had to know that she was precious to Rio.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, felt Agatha squeeze her tighter, and said against her ear as the room dispersed again to try and replicate what the two actors alone had been able to achieve. “Jamás te pegaría. Lo que dijiste el otro día… no puedo sacármelo de la cabeza. Agatha, yo...” <em>I would never hit you. What you said the other day… I can’t get it out of my head. Agatha I-…”</em></p><p>The woman in her arms broke away from her hold, and Rio almost fell.</p><p>Agatha had broken their embrace so suddenly, almost violently, that Rio choked on a breath. The room around them was still alive with movement, everyone still trying to emulate the trust that had just been put on show.</p><p>Rio was <em>just</em> holding on, her fingertips only able to tickle the fabric of Agatha’s shirt, let alone hold it.</p><p>And suddenly her hands were removed, and held. Rio looked down at them, at the wrong ring on Agatha’s left hand as Agatha said, “Sé que estas manos nunca podrían hacerme daño.” <em>I know these hands could never hurt me.”</em></p><p>Rio felt tears sting her eyes the second Agatha squeezed her hand. She felt one fall and then be gently wiped away. And the room dissolved around them as their eyes met and the complex being before her unravelled just that little bit more.</p><p>She hadn’t said it because she thought Rio would hit her. She’d <em>asked</em> it because she couldn’t bear the silence, the time.</p><p>She dropped her gaze again as Agatha squeezed her hands and lost herself in the glint of the pear-shaped diamond that should never have been allowed to touch Agatha’s hands.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Rio couldn’t look away from the ring winking up at her. Even as Agatha dropped her hands and Billy stole her attention. Even as Agatha turned to the man and her hand now lay at her side. Even as Agatha’s thumb began to twist it, making the diamond disappear and reappear at will.</p><p>It was a cruel magic. One that meant for a brief moment Rio didn’t have to see the wrongness of the ring, before it was back again, and treasured by a hand Rio wanted to hold, and by fingers which belonged between her own.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked and raised her gaze again to find that Billy was looking at her expectantly.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Want to do a trust fall?”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said as Agatha moved away and Rio turned to watch her drift towards Lilia who was sitting down and talking to a newly arrived Maria. “Sure, kid. Whatever you want.”</p><p>Turned out, Billy wasn’t great at trust falls. His second and third attempts weren’t any better than his first. But Rio let him try. And he always apologised, which she appreciated given the fact that if he ever let her <em>actually</em> fall she might get an <em>actual</em> concussion.</p><p>She was aware of Agatha’s eyes on her the whole time.</p><p>Once she’d decided that allowing this to go on much longer might lead to some injuries, Sue called for calm in the noisy room. Rio turned to her and felt a sudden presence at her side and knew without looking that Agatha was back close again.</p><p>“Oooookay!” Another clap of her hands. “Let’s ramp this baby up. Trust is vital, but communication is essential.”</p><p>Rio felt Billy lean against her and mutter, “There are more Oscar winners in this room than-…”</p><p>“Mr Kaplan! You’ve volunteered yourself! Please come here.”</p><p>Rio fought a smirk as Billy groaned and went to the centre of the room to take Sue’s outstretched hand. His shoulders shrunk down as Sue turned him to look at her and now stood a couple feet apart.</p><p>“Meisner! I like to call it: Meisner’s Mirror.”</p><p>“Oh Jesus,” a low voice sounded beside her and Rio did smirk this time when she saw Agatha’s face.</p><p>“If I were you I’d be looking in the mirror all the time.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her in surprise and for a second Rio was just a girl flirting with another girl in the middle of class. And the trauma of everything that had happened between them both dissolved as she grinned across at the prettiest girl she’d ever seen.</p><p>“Ladies?”</p><p>Rio turned back but felt a finger brush the width of her hand as she did. She knew it was an acknowledgement of the flirt, but she couldn’t try to cash in. She couldn’t flirt again. She couldn’t allow herself to slip into the danger zone that led to forgiveness and inevitable heartache.</p><p>So ignored the touch, focused on what they were being asked to do. And enjoyed the fact that for even a brief moment, she’d been free of pain.</p><p>It was a simple exercise. A state and repeat type exercise done in acting classes the world over. You pick a partner, stand two arms’ lengths apart, then one makes a statement and the other states it back, directly reflecting it. The goal is to move closer when the feeling is right, to take the words of your partner and send them back using every emotion in your arsenal.</p><p>The result was usually that you had people trying to out act each other.</p><p>Rio could guess who Agatha would want to be with before she even stepped closer and inclined her head in a silent question. She smiled her assent, rather than giving it verbally, and they both assumed the position and waited for the word “go”.</p><p>They hadn’t decided who would make the first statement, who would determine the theme, but Rio already knew it would be Agatha.</p><p>And apparently Agatha did too because a second after Sue’s loud instruction to start she said:</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes for a second, acknowledged the pain that she’d been so blissfully free of not a minute ago, then opened them again and reflected it back: “You miss me.”</p><p>“I miss you,” Agatha said once more, the corner of her lips twitching just slightly. She took a step forwards.</p><p>“You miss me,” Rio said a little louder, her chin rising, but she remained still.</p><p>“I miss you.” Agatha took another step closer and Rio’s gaze dropped briefly to the hand that had twitched in her direction.</p><p>She hesitated this time, weighing up her options.</p><p>She took a breath, then lifted her head again, forced a smile, took a step. “You miss me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded her head, her lips twitching again and in her eyes Rio saw an honesty that belied the acting they were both supposedly doing in the exercise.</p><p>A movement beside them made Rio look, and she saw Sue moving over through the other bodies all either moving towards their partner or remaining in place. Everyone had a different expression on their face. They were saying things as myriad and varied as: “I hate you”, “you’re wearing red”, “I hate the rain”, and “your shoes are ugly”.</p><p>But only Agatha and Rio weren’t acting.</p><p>And Sue had come to witness it.</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>Rio turned back and saw Agatha was closer again, a bright smile on her face, a familiar smile. It was the kind of expression Agatha so naturally gave when she’d spotted Rio across the room, across the red carpet, but only in the before times. Now she looked forlorn. Now she looked exhausted or hopeful or defeated.</p><p>It was the kind of smile that tugged at whatever string Rio imagined tethered her to Agatha. The kind of smile that made her move before she’d even spoken: “You miss me.”</p><p>“Incredible, ladies,” Sue whispered from by Rio’s right shoulder.</p><p>Agatha’s smile faded slowly as she remained focused on Rio and Rio sucked in a deep breath, felt her chest expand with it, and then her hand was full of Agatha’s again and she remained stationery as she said: “You miss me.”</p><p>She’d skipped Agatha’s turn, for no reason other than she wanted Agatha to know she understood what she’d been trying to say through the medium of the Meisner method.</p><p>Sue from beside her moved around and she saw a blonde head disappearing. Agatha took a second and then stepped closer and there were barely inches between them now, barely space to breathe.</p><p>But Rio’s eyes were back on Agatha, and Agatha’s lips were parting to say the familiar phrase she’d chosen to be used as their shared mirror. But Rio interrupted her, took a step too, said the words into Agatha’s ear, “I miss you too,” and then she stepped back.</p><p>She stepped back even as Agatha’s right hand had moved to her side to hold her. She stepped back and dropped the hold of her hand. She stepped back and placed a much distance between them as there had been before.</p><p>Her cheeks felt warm, her fingers tingling from where they’d held Agatha’s hand.</p><p>And the room was still loud, still vibrating with the buzz of people reflecting phrases back at their partners. Agatha remained silent, her lower lip tugged between her teeth, her eyes only on Rio. When Rio turned back, she didn’t look away, and Rio stepped closer, ignored Agatha’s hand as it reached for her own again and instead casually looped their arms together.</p><p>It was a means of being close without allowing herself to fall into her again. And Agatha allowed it, allowed the casual nature of the hold, took it gratefully in fact, and again mirrored Rio in the way she now turned to look out over the room and enjoy the sight of their fellow actors all stepping and speaking in the round.</p><p>The activity lasted less than two more minutes but Rio didn’t pull her arm back until Billy had skipped over to her again.</p><p>“We’re now going to read a couple scenes whilst keeping in motion, okay? You have to be in charge of your instrument but aware of your fellow actors. It’s about knowing where you are and where everyone else is. The basics of acting!”</p><p>Rio rubbed her temple, torn between laughter and disbelief, made worse by a complaining Billy beside her.</p><p>But she had no choice. She moved with the swarm as she fetched a script from the pile on the table and began to walk as she flicked through to find the right scene.</p><p>It took a few rounds of the room and a page and a half until she realised that two people apparently <em>had</em> a choice.</p><p>Agatha and Lilia were the only two sitting down. And no one had said anything. Because who says anything to Agatha Harkness? Who questions Lilia Calderu?</p><p>She knew Agatha often didn’t play well with others. Especially when it felt like play, and not work. So it wasn’t that much of a surprise that she’d chosen to sit this one out. Especially when she couldn’t partner with Rio in the exercise.</p><p>Lilia had probably played the age card, so no one could be mad at that. Though Rio had felt the strength of her grip earlier so secretly thought that Lilia would have no problem at all wandering around the room for a few minutes.</p><p>Rio adjusted her route as best she could once she’d noticed where Agatha was. She made sure to stay to the other side of the room. She had barely any lines anyway, so she could concentrate instead on not hitting anyone and not veering too close to Agatha.</p><p>The walking, the concentrating on other people, it gave her time to think.</p><p>She knew only one thing for sure: she was in love with Agatha.</p><p>The rest was still bouncing around in her mind like the people moving in a fluctuating current around her. Reverberating through her brain were the doubts she still had. The things that she didn’t trust, that didn’t make sense.</p><p>The fear she still had that Agatha thought she was childish, that she had meant everything she’d shouted at her, and that Agatha would crush her again.</p><p>But her dad’s voice was there now: “Confía en tu corazón. Confía en tu dolor. Confía en Agatha's.” <em>Trust your heart. Trust your pain. Trust Agatha’s.</em></p><p>It helped. It calmed the furore.</p><p>The exercise ended after a little under half an hour.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, felt one of the guys playing one of the doctors nudge her shoulder and smile at her. She smiled back. Sue was talking now, closing out the session with too much praise and not enough authenticity. But it was over, Rio could leave.</p><p>As she turned to, she found that she was already being hugged by the actor playing the doctor. She hugged him back and felt as she did a hand in her lower back.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio turned, knew who she was about it greet, and saw Agatha’s eyes not on her but on the doctor actor. It took a second for Agatha to look her way but the time it took allowed Rio to look at her properly, to see the tiredness in her face, the dullness in her blue eyes.</p><p>If Jen had been right before and Agatha had actually slept a little then it was clear she needed a lot more sleep still.</p><p>Agatha looked around, and Rio knew it was only because the other actor had moved away.</p><p>“It was good to see you.”</p><p>Soft lips pressed into her cheek and before Rio could so much as close her eyes to submit to the feeling, Agatha had pulled away. She turned to see her march out of the room and avoid everyone who tried to get to her before she did.</p><p>But then Rio was descended upon. Without Agatha as a barrier to accessing her, she gave and received at least a dozen hugs before she was able to leave.</p><p>She walked through the lot in the direction of the wardrobe trailers. It was still early enough in the day that surely at least one of the team would be around still. In the week or so before filming started it was the crew who were the busiest. So it made sense to her when she spotted Stevie just a few hundred yards away stepping from the second wardrobe trailer.</p><p>“Stevie!”</p><p>The woman stopped in her tracks and turned. Upon recognising Rio she beamed and gestured to the two shoe boxes in her arms, “No rest for the wicked. How’s rehearsal?”</p><p>“A lot of trust exercises and walking around.”</p><p>“Yikes.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “But actually, I have a favour to ask you. Y’know those rings you had all in Agatha’s size? Do you still have them?”</p><p>“Oh. Uh. Maybe? I’d have to check. I can’t tonight but…”</p><p>“Here,” Rio said quickly, feeling as though suddenly getting those rings was urgent. “Can I give you my number?”</p><p>“Is this,” Stevie narrowed her eyes, “Rio Vidal, is this your way of <em>giving</em> me your number?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and couldn’t figure out whether agreeing or saying no would get her those rings faster. “Aren’t you straight?”</p><p>“Well,” Stevie looked her over and shifted her weight on the spot. “Not every day a movie star asks for your number.”</p><p>“Technically I asked to give you mine.”</p><p>Stevie just raised her brows and Rio grinned, “So?”</p><p>“Back pocket.”</p><p>Rio moved around and gingerly fished Stevie’s phone from her back pocket and held it up expectantly. “Code is 728532. Add it in. I’ll text you if I find them. Though some may have already been sent back.”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Rio said quickly, wasting no time in inputting the code for fear she’d forget it already as Stevie started to jabber on about how fussy Billy was about shoes.</p><p>“Here,” she moved around Stevie and placed her phone back in her pocket.</p><p>“You’re smooth, Rio, I’ll give you that.”</p><p>Rio laughed but thought Stevie really wasn’t taking this request seriously. “But text as soon as you know, please. I’ve had a change of mind about her ring and want it to be right before we start shooting.”</p><p>“You actors and your costumes, honestly. But sure, I’ll reach out.”</p><p>Stevie winked as she left and Rio had to laugh at herself, groaning as she rubbed her hands over her face and stood for a while in the middle of the rows upon rows of trailers. If Stevie couldn’t unearth the rings again, she’d go out and buy one. She’d make sure Agatha had something that was from her, rather than Alice.</p><p>Agatha was getting comfort from a lie.</p><p>And Rio knew better than anyone how lies could destroy someone.</p><p>She had to get Agatha this ring. Had to explain. Had to hope she would accept it.</p><p>When she went home that night she went home to Alice, as usual. Only this was the first time she’d stepped into her house and truly wished she could be alone. She wanted to think some more, wanted to call her dad and pop a melatonin.</p><p>Instead she spent some time with Alice, told her about the exercises, and was honest about what she’d done to Peter Quill. The bad actress in the room couldn’t hide her feelings about any of it, but she tempered them, she softened them, and Rio was grateful for it.</p><p>When she managed to swallow down some of the dinner Alice had made she called her dad, she took a melatonin, and just as she was settling down to sleep her phone buzzed:</p><p>9:07pm<br/>
Unknown number: Hey, it’s Stevie!! I found the rings. Stop by tomorrow morning xx</p><p>Rio fell asleep with a flicker of hope quivering in her empty chest.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p><p>Rio was awake before even Alice was.</p><p>Which wasn’t unusual.</p><p>It was unheard of.</p><p>And it turned out Alice didn’t appreciate this role reversal. She hated being woken up more than Rio did and she grunted and grumbled more than Rio did.</p><p>So much so, in fact, that Rio was being chased from the room with a pillow after the second time she’d called Alice “her sweet little sleepy friend”.</p><p>It had made her cackle, despite eventually getting a mouthful of pillow when Alice finally caught her. But it was worth it because when she’d eventually dragged Alice to set and made it to the second wardrobe trailer, Stevie was already there sipping on a steaming mug of coffee and singing idly to the radio.</p><p>“Knock knock,” Rio announced, grinning as best she could in the still early hours of the morning. “You’re an angel, you know that?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, tell me something I don’t know.”</p><p>Stevie winked at her and lazily heaved herself up from her chair to motion for Rio to come in and follow her to the small pile of ring boxes she’d laid on on the coffee table.</p><p>“Your wish is my command. Turns out we’d only actually returned one of them and it was an ugly amethyst ring that belonged to Geri anyway.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly, pretending to care as she began to open each box individually and inspect the contents.</p><p>“They’re all her size but not all rings are created equally so we do have some additional sizers if she needs one to make it fit.”</p><p>Rio hummed again, now opening a small red box with an asscher cut ring inside. She lifted it out and watched it glint in the light for a while before replacing it and continuing her search.</p><p>“So,” Stevie said conversationally, watching Rio curiously now as the actress continued to check each box with a look of great concentration on her face. “About my number?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Rio was opening a dark green box, it looked a little battered, she assumed whoever had owned it or wherever it had been borrowed from would have called this box “well-loved”. But the ring inside was pristine, was a brilliant cut emerald shaped diamond adorning a plain gold band.</p><p>She held it up to the light as Stevie said, “Was it a come on? I mean… I was thinking about it last night and-…”</p><p>“It’s this one,” Rio said reverently, her attention only on the ring. “This is the one.”</p><p>In Rio’s mind she was already picturing the way it would sit on Agatha’s finger. It was a much larger diamond than the one she already wore, a shape that would suit her better, a ring that felt more <em>Agatha</em> than any Rio had seen.</p><p>A ring she wanted to give to her and see her wear proudly.</p><p>“Right,” Stevie said, shaking herself out of her train of thought, “Great. Feel free to just take it and get Agatha to bring the other one back. We’ll sort it all out.”</p><p>Rio nodded absently, the farthest thing from her mind now being Agatha’s reaction when Rio asked her to swap the rings. She replaced the ring in its box and held it securely in her fist as she turned to Stevie with a genuine smile this time. “Total angel.”</p><p>“That’s me!” Stevie laughed a little, her cheeks slightly flushed as Rio pressed a kiss to both of them.</p><p>It was only when Rio shut the door to the trailer as she left that she vaguely registered what Stevie might have been trying to tell her. She paused in the chill of the morning, one mind to go back and explain, the other to let it lie and not bring it up again for both of their sakes.</p><p>Her second instinct won.</p><p>Back in her own trailer she found Alice waiting on her, two mugs of coffee on the side, and a foil-wrapped bagel that she ignored in favour of the coffee.</p><p>“Let’s see!”</p><p>Rio threw her the box, blew cool air over her coffee, and watched as Alice inspected the ring. “Okay,” she admitted after a little while of looking at it from every angle and watching it catch the light. “It’s more Agatha. Fine.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and shuffled closer to Alice on the couch, holding out her now warm palm to take the ring back.</p><p>“I hope she takes it.”</p><p>“Jen says she only takes that damn ring off when she’s home with Nicky.”</p><p>“Ralph’s not back?”</p><p>“No. Pretty sure he’s not back for a while.”</p><p>Rio nodded, distracted by the light refracting off the diamond in the palm of her hand, “I told her once I’d buy her a ring bigger than his.”</p><p>She whispered the words, her mind elsewhere entirely, back in a grimy bathroom in Chicago where her memories were hazy but the feeling was anything but.</p><p>“I think it’s one of the very first things I said to her.”</p><p>Alice was silent for a minute before she uttered: “Would you marry her? Right now, if she asked? If she weren’t married?”</p><p>“In a heartbeat.”</p><p>“Then why are you waiting? Why aren’t you talking to her now when-…?”</p><p>“Because I still have to hear why she did it. I have to hear why she slept with Ralph, why she left me, just how much of a child she thinks-…” Rio sighed quietly, creating a fist around the ring and letting the sharp edges of it cut into her palm.</p><p>“I need to… I need to not break when she tells me all of that. Because I want her. So badly. And if I break, then I might not be able to hold her.”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice whispered like a sigh, and Rio turned to her friend with a sad sort of smile.</p><p>“I just need to be as ready to hear what she has to say as possible. I’ll be ready by Sunday. I will be. If she still wants me then-…”</p><p>“I’m fucking furious with her and I’m a little worried she’s still-…” Alice sighed heavily and seemed to think better of what she was going to say, “but even I can’t deny that she so obviously still wants you, Rio.”</p><p>“Maybe. But I thought she wanted me when she went and fucked Ralph so what do we know.”</p><p>Alice sighed heavily this time, and held Rio’s fist that still held the ring. “Eat your bagel, you have a long day of hair and makeup ahead of you. <em>Plus</em> you need to learn your lines. I know you’re not off book, Vidal. Big scene to run through tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and eventually managed to eat half her bagel, hide away the new ring, and make her way over to the hair and makeup trailer.</p><p>Inside she found it to already be full of movement, noise, and activity. There were four chairs along the row of mirrors all framed with bright, unforgiving lights.</p><p>The first two chairs were occupied by Billy and Lilia, and the fourth chair, way at the back of the space, housed Agatha.</p><p>Everyone looked around when Rio walked in and Rio managed a smile as she squeezed Billy and Lilia both in the shoulder and was then swept up into a hug by the lead hairstylist, Brett, with whom she’d worked before.</p><p>“God you look like shit. Has Alice been neglecting you or something?”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Rio laughed as over Brett’s shoulder where she stood on her tiptoes to hug him, she caught Agatha’s eye.</p><p>She pulled back, grinned up at the man, “It’s your job to fix me.”</p><p>“Trying to make my job harder, huh? No snacks for you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she was directed to take her seat and greeted two new assistants as they came to take her coffee order and begin piling up the products that had already been chosen for her hair.</p><p>She focused on herself, on the people helping, on Brett as he began to finger through her hair, muttering to himself and throwing orders and requests in every which direction until he met eyes with Rio through to the glass.</p><p>“Was this Maria’s choice? Who made you cut your hair?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly, suddenly aware of Agatha just a few feet to her left.</p><p>“I did it for a friend’s son.”</p><p>Not technically a lie, but also quite a big lie.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“He had a hair cut he didn’t like, a shorter one, so I… cut my hair.”</p><p>Brett eyed her for a while to see if she was taking the piss but when he saw just plain honesty in her large eye, and a little embarrassment, he slumped his shoulders. “Well, that’s sweet, hon. But ruins what plans I had for you. Cute braids, fishtails…”</p><p>Rio only hummed quietly, and as Brett turned to speak to his nearest assistant she turned to see Agatha and saw that she was staring down at her hands, spinning the diamond as fast as she’d ever seen it.</p><p>The rest of the time in the chair she focused on laughing when Brett made a joke, talking when necessary, and otherwise she kept her attentions on the script Alice had delivered to her about an hour after she’d arrived.</p><p>Billy and Lilia were done before Rio and Agatha were and Rio was done only shortly after Lilia left.</p><p>In the whole time she’d been there - three hours now - she’d not spoken to Agatha and had mostly been able to avoid looking at her too.</p><p>But as she left she smiled at her, received a smile back, and Rio left with the heaviness of a ring not on her person but already weighing against her soul.</p><p> </p><p><strong>TUESDAY</strong></p><p>Tuesday came with it a bout of bad weather and a bad schedule for Rio.</p><p>Through the wind and the rain, she had to stomp her way to Studio B for some rehearsals with Quill, Billy, and Agatha.</p><p>There had been a murmuring that James might be there too but the child liaison officer charged with his wellbeing had suggested there was no need to rehearse the heavy scenes they were due to run through with a child present.</p><p>It would be cruel and unnecessary, which is exactly how Rio had felt this last week had been.</p><p>Her role for most of these scenes was to be a foil to Agatha’s character Kate. The dynamic was that whilst Kate was “the strong and stoic one”, Dani was her more “emotionally intelligent and calm” wife. She mostly had to react to Agatha, mostly had to temper the Quill’s character, Andrew’s, anger at her.</p><p>She mostly had to stand by Billy and advocate for him, the youngest of the three siblings, Jules.</p><p>It was an emotionally complex scene, one of the longer ones in the movie, and would be shot a bit like a play. Maria was keen for it to be shot without any cuts or breaks in the action, which meant they had to be word perfect before they could even think about shooting.</p><p>And Rio was yet to memorise the whole script, but she had this one section down. Potentially because it was one of the more intense ones that didn’t require her to be discussing more kids with Agatha or telling her she loved her.</p><p>The day was intense.</p><p>Quill was obnoxious and ribald and Rio thought often about punching him again. But he seemed to have at least learnt his lesson that joking about Agatha and Rio fucking with him watching was off-limits.</p><p>Rio wondered how long that would last after a particularly bawdy joke about blue balls.</p><p>Whilst she had to concentrate hard to remember her lines, wanting to not be the one actor in the room who had to keep checking over and over again, she still had time and bandwidth to marvel at Agatha.</p><p>She was off-book.</p><p>She didn’t so much as glance at her script.</p><p>She delivered each line as if it were the first time she were ever saying it.</p><p>She was phenomenal and Rio had a feeling that if she’d never heard of or met this woman in her life up until now, she might have fallen head over heels from the sheer magnitude of talent on display.</p><p>But the other actor in the room, the youngest of the group, was struggling a little. Billy was also not off-book. And where Rio was mesmerised by Agatha, so was he.</p><p>Billy fumbled with every line that came after one of Agatha’s. He enthusiastically tried to continue on until Maria had to, most of the time, call cut to get him his line checked.</p><p>Rio felt sorry for him during these moments but mostly she felt grateful it wasn’t her needing the extra help.</p><p>As they rehearsed and rehashed, she found her energy waning, and noticed that Agatha, too, by only two in the afternoon, also looked on her last legs. It happened so suddenly, that one minute Agatha was all dazzle, and the next minute, she was pale, and the mistakes were slipping in.</p><p>They stopped for lunch just after Agatha’s fifth mistake of the day and Rio watched as Agatha picked at her food and instead chugged coffee. She recognised her own behaviours in that of the older brunette and in doing so felt sick.</p><p>The only words Rio said to Agatha all day were these: “please eat”.</p><p>She’d whispered them close to her ear as she’d stood from the table to go and fetch another drink and when she’d returned with it Agatha was making more of an effort with her food, but avoiding eye contact with everyone, including Rio.</p><p>After their late lunch, the afternoon went a little smoother in terms of performances. Agatha was again back on track and even Billy managed to make it through a whole run of the scene without needing his lines called out to him by the script supervisor.</p><p>It was long, it was gruelling, and by the time the sun had set and everyone was released to go home, Rio wanted to crawl into her bed and think of nothing but blue eyes as they once had been, not as they now were.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p><p>The pre-agreed day for lunch with James, Agatha, and Maria had arrived.</p><p>Rio wasn’t happy about it.</p><p>She couldn’t imagine <em>Agatha</em> was happy about it. But at least it was the only thing she had scheduled in today. Which meant, much to Alice’s delight, that she could spend most of the morning actually trying to remember her lines.</p><p>Lunch had been arranged at a local restaurant rather than the set for reasons still unclear to Rio. Alice had been waxing lyrical about Maria’s wanting everything to be as “natural” and “easy” as any regular family, and so “naturally” and “easily” she’d chosen an regular restaurant.</p><p>So Rio turned up the last of the lot and found that when she arrived at the restaurant there were already paps waiting outside. She ignored them as she walked inside but wondered if they’d been there for Agatha’s arrival or if they’d arrived only after they’d got wind of Agatha Harkness dining with her director and two costars. She didn’t have time to dwell as she was led to the back of the restaurant where her little fake family plus Maria were sitting and it felt anything other than <em>regular</em>.</p><p>James was the first to spot her and exclaimed which made both Agatha and Maria turn to her and stand from their seats. James reached her first, keen to hug and be hugged before anyone else.</p><p>And Rio was charmed by it because who wouldn’t be charmed by a small boy enthusiastically wrapping his arms around your legs. She managed to untangle him and hug him back and found herself, to her great surprise, being called by him (again, enthusiastically), “mama Rio!”.</p><p>It took her a second to process this and she must have pulled a strange face because little James laughed his big laugh and Rio blushed slightly.</p><p>“Rio! So glad you could make it!”</p><p>Now the way Alice had told her of this invitation, it hadn’t exactly sounded like she’d had much choice in the matter. But she restrained herself from pointing this out as she gave Maria a quick one-armed hug, and the director then gently pried James away from her so she could turn to Agatha.</p><p>Unlike the other two hugs, this one was warmer, the only natural one of the lot. And Rio was smiling already by the time Agatha murmured against her ear, “He’s calling me ‘mama Aggie’. How do I not kill a five year old?”</p><p>Her smile turned into a laugh as Agatha kissed her cheek quickly and pulled away. Agatha’s expression was serious until suddenly it wasn’t and Rio wanted to take her hand and pull her from the restaurant to just keep her to herself.</p><p>But Agatha was clearly the stronger of the two, and she grinned and winked before she turned back to take up her spot at the table beside James and diagonally across from Rio’s empty seat.</p><p>“So,” Maria announced happily, “isn’t this cosy.”</p><p>“Cosy cosy!” James announced as he picked his crayon back up and continued to make the big swipes of blue across his colouring book.</p><p>“Cosy,” Agatha agreed with a hint of sarcasm that Rio caught but Maria clearly didn’t.</p><p>“I’m so so keen that we’re all aligned on being as much a family as possible.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Rio watched as her pale fingers, notably sans Alice’s ring, tapped at her water glass.</p><p>“Easy,” Rio said absently, choosing to bluff her way through the meal as much as possible. “The script’s good and we trust you to direct us so it’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat again and Rio couldn’t help it when she added, “Plus Agatha’s just lost the Oscar to me making her a four time nominee, one time winner. We’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows shot up in surprise at the dig and Rio smirked at her, not missing the slight twitch of her lips as their eyes met.</p><p>Maybe the meal wouldn’t be so bad after all.</p><p>“It truly is such a gift to have you both. Obviously with Wanda on board initially, I was excited too but this combo…” she trailed off and gestured between the two women and Rio wondered if she’d feel differently if she knew the truth. But she said nothing and only smiled some more.</p><p>Before they ordered Maria was the person making the most effort at the table.</p><p>But then Rio didn’t really mind this because all she had to do was nod at the right times and smile when absolutely necessary. The rest of the time? The rest of the time she could watch Agatha. She could make eyes at Agatha. She could map the lines and curves of the face she knew and loved so well.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away whilst Rio did this. Their light converged, twin stars burning with a brilliance owed not to life, but to death. Something about not having been able to be herself with Agatha, not being able to truly enjoy seeing or being with Agatha, it had changed her, changed the both of them.</p><p>Perhaps their before selves had died together in their last moments spent in that house in Berkeley. And now there was just after.</p><p>They were different now.</p><p>They could be better now.</p><p>“No creo en el destino, mija. Pero creo en ti. Creo que ya sabes lo que quieres. Y cuando estés lista, y cuando sepas que ella también, serás mejor y más brillante que nunca.” <em>I don't believe in fate, my daughter. But I believe in you. I believe you already know what you want. And when you are ready, and when you know she is too, you will be better and brighter than ever.</em></p><p>Her dad’s words rung in her ears as she looked into those oceanic eyes.</p><p>She just had to get through the next few days and keep a steady head until Sunday, <em>especially</em> on Sunday.</p><p>“Rio?” Her dad’s voice died in her brain as she turned to Maria, “How do you feel about that?”</p><p><em>Oh shit.</em></p><p>Her fucking dad. His fucking stupid, fucking kind, fucking-…</p><p>“It’s not in mine or Rio’s contract to do that,” Agatha said suddenly, “at least, it isn’t in mine. And I know Alice isn’t an idiot so she wouldn’t have agreed to it either. Christmas away from home for press would be ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio blinked, looked at Agatha and saw that she’d shot her a meaningful ‘you’re welcome’ look.</p><p>“Why would,” Rio cleared her throat and turned to absently roll back a stray crayon towards James. “I mean, why would you-…?”</p><p>“To promote the whole holiday season,” Agatha said sharply, though Rio knew well enough that the sharpness wasn’t aimed at her. “I agreed up until five days before Christmas. I’m sure Rio is the same, and if not, I’d renegotiate my contract to cover her too.”</p><p>Rio looked up from where James had considered this crayon rolling thing a game and was now rolling three crayons at once in her direction. She blindly grabbed them as she watched Maria splutter on her soda and lime.</p><p>“Really, Agatha. It took so long to get you on board I-… no, I mean… it was just an errant idea.”</p><p>James started up again: “Mama Rio! Crayon pleeeeeaaaase!”</p><p>Rio turned back to him and one by one returned the crayons, this time <em>not</em> rolling them. She heard Agatha take in a heavy breath and just knew she was about to offload something on Maria so took her turn instead, “Did you invite us here to negotiate contracts with a five year old present so we might be softer?”</p><p>“I mean…”</p><p>Rio looked up, but not at Maria, she looked at Agatha, and Agatha? Well she looked incandescent.</p><p>“You know what?” Rio asked quickly, her eyes still on Agatha, her hands now held up like a wall as James continued to roll his crayons at her and giggle every time they smacked her palms. “Why don’t we order some ice cream for James and then head on out? I won’t discuss contracts without either Alice or a lawyer and neither will Agatha.”</p><p>As Maria spluttered some more, Agatha turned to look at her. Her jaw was still tight, her eyes hard and unreadable for a second before she nodded and turned back to Maria again.</p><p>“Sounds like a plan,” Maria said lamely and Rio barely glanced at her before she looked back at James and caught the last of his crayons in her hand.</p><p>“Sound good, buddy? Would you like some ice cream?”</p><p>“Excuse me just one second,” Maria left for the bathroom as James began to bounce in his chair and the four year old was suddenly in danger of knocking over his water before Agatha expertly reached for it was the nonchalance of a mother.</p><p>“Ice cream for you, mama Aggie?”</p><p>Rio noticed Agatha’s jaw twitch and she had to hide her smile for fear it might twitch in her direction too. But Agatha managed to say a soft, “Not for me, honey.”</p><p>“Mama Rioooooooo?”</p><p>Unsure when she’d been designated “mama” still, Rio nodded and watched as James bounced even more and tried to climb over the table to her until Agatha gently pulled him back.</p><p>“Christmas,” she was saying as she pulled the little kid into her lap to try and isolate his excited limbs, “in a foreign country all to celebrate a movie is so insane I can’t even-… argh!” James had discovered Agatha’s hair and decided he liked it more than his crayons.</p><p>“James,” Agatha said patiently as Rio watched her try to gently disentangle his hands from her hair. She grimaced again and Rio moved from her seat to go help. Turned out all James really needed to stop doing whatever naughty thing he was doing was a distraction. And Rio was happy to oblige if it meant Agatha could keep her hair on her head rather than ripped out in clumps by the little boy.</p><p>She leant over them and lifted James from Agatha and shot Agatha a quick glance before she marched over to the bar with the boy on her hip. With his hand in her own to prevent at least one of them from grabbing <em>her</em> hair, she was able to make an order of two small ice cream sundaes and then head back to the table by the time Maria was back.</p><p>The two women were sitting in total silence.</p><p>“So,” Rio said as calmly as she could as James was placed back in his seat. “Where’s your mama, James?”</p><p>“She’s coming in an hour or so,” Maria answered for him and Rio glanced up to make eyes at Agatha at this announcement. It meant only one thing: a whole hour to sit through this so-called “family bonding lunch”.</p><p>James had already proven himself a handful and Maria wasn’t exactly anyone’s favourite either. Especially as far as Agatha was concerned.</p><p>But they managed to struggle through some small talk, some basic discussions about filming, and all paid as much attention to the boisterous boy who was so unlike Agatha’s actual son and Rio’s mellizo as they could.</p><p>Agatha remained mostly silent throughout the rest of the lunch, and only really smiled again when James’s mom came to fetch him and the boy was gone, Rio’s sweater was ruined with the imprints of sticky, chocolatey fingers, and Agatha’s somehow remained pristine.</p><p>“How did you get here, Rio? Agatha and I took a car. Join us?”</p><p>Rio agreed, because it was easier than to make excuses. Besides, she thought perhaps she might save Maria’s life - or at least dignity - if she were a buffer between her and Agatha in a shared car.</p><p>Maria paid the check and confirmed the car was just outside so they gathered their things to get going. Only, by the door, with Rio being ahead of the pack, did she spot before the others what awaited them. She stopped and felt a hand on her lower back she knew already would be Agatha’s.</p><p>Reaching behind herself to take it she held on tight as she marched with her outside into the small crowd of photographers gathered to capture the photo of two Oscar-winning actresses and their Oscar-winning director.</p><p>A wave of panic flooded her chest that hadn’t been there when she was alone. She didn’t know why, didn’t have time to process, but felt it more viscerally than she had in a long while.</p><p>If she’d had any time at all to stop and think she might have recognised that the last time this panic had coursed through her it had been when she was trying to get Nicky safely through the hoard of paps that had awaited them in London.</p><p>Rio didn’t let go of Agatha’s hand until she had opened the car door and stepped back for Agatha to climb in first. The look Agatha gave her when she stepped around her made her hesitate before she climbed in after her. But Agatha wasn’t having it. She wouldn’t allow it. She’d grabbed at Rio’s lapels and pulled her in after her, making her stumble into her on the back seat of the large SUV.</p><p>Maria came in just as Rio was blushing and righting herself and Agatha only released her hold on her when the door slammed shut.</p><p>Clearing her throat Rio could feel her heart blocking her airways and it wasn’t until Agatha leant around her, one arm coming up to rest behind her head on the seat, the other to tap at Maria, and crossing over Rio’s stomach, that she could breathe again.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t subtle about her care for Rio anymore. At least, not to Rio’s mind.</p><p>She’d barely spoken to Maria since the contract negotiations incident, and yet now she was actively engaging her, asking about characterisation during a hospital scene, all so she could have her arms around Rio who sat between them.</p><p>Rio could thank her only by pressing their thighs together, and as Agatha remained encircled around her she felt her anxiety begin to calm to that same dull thrum that had been ever-present over the last few days.</p><p>Agatha only pulled back when they pulled to a stop in the studio’s parking lot. Maria had stepped from the car already and just as Rio had turned to follow her out, Agatha had taken her hand and made her turn around.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“Fine. Yeah. Fine.”</p><p>She knew Agatha didn’t believe her but she was okay with that. And Agatha released her so Rio could give Maria a quick hug, shoot Agatha a smile as she stepped out onto terra firma, and then disappear off into the maze that was the studio set.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p><p>Thursday was a day that started off with Anna Vidal, rather than Miguel.</p><p>Rio had called her dad’s phone and found a much softer, more feminine voice at the other end of it. But her mom hadn’t let on that she knew why Rio was calling, and she hadn’t mentioned that she knew all of what she’d been talking to her dad about over the past week.</p><p>She simply asked how she was, told her she loved her, and passed the phone to Miguel.</p><p>After what was a quick ten minutes where Rio found that just listening to her dad talk about the work in the garden he was going to do was able to ground her, she hung up and went to work with the ever-present shadow that was Alice.</p><p>Their day was a hectic one, with lighting tests and walk arounds planned on set. It meant that Rio had to be present, had to be constantly listening to her director as she pointed out shots, called out instructions, and placements and costumes were adjusted and tweaked.</p><p>It was one of those days where Rio was able to become better acquainted with the crew. A camera guy she knew from another set, but didn’t remember the name of, became a boon through most of the day.</p><p>He made sure to help her find her mark if she’d lost her concentration for a moment and drifted too far over. The boom operator, too, was familiar to her, but she soon realised only because they’d met at a party years ago when they were both trying to get their foot in the door.</p><p>And so the day was easy, for the most part. She didn’t see Agatha, though she knew she was somewhere doing something.</p><p>Her thoughts remained mostly quiet, and she wasn’t in deep despair for more than the few seconds of thinking time she had between new set ups or the time it took to move between the different sets already constructed for the shoot next week.</p><p>Set-life was busy now, constantly humming with activity. And Rio, and her fellow actors, were no longer the real focus. The crew now were the important ones.</p><p>Things were needing lit, built, and planned. Everything was on a tight deadline, everything was late, everything was urgent.</p><p>So by the time Rio was done for the day, no one paid much mind to her slinking off with Alice and heading home. It was whilst at home, whilst in the quiet comfort of her house in the hills, that the thoughts came back, louder and more virulent than ever.</p><p>She spoke through them with Alice, laid everything out on the table as she cradled her beloved barolo to her chest and stared at the ring sitting erect in its little cushion in its little box.</p><p>“I just don’t see what was wrong with my choice.”</p><p>Rio huffed quietly, unable to rehash the same conversation over and over.</p><p>“She thinks it’s from me.”</p><p>“And? Let her.”</p><p>“Alice, please. I need to give her one that-…”</p><p>“Rio, babe-…”</p><p>“I’m not discussing it anymore, Alice. I can’t stand to watch her fucking twist it and touch it like it’s this magical thing that brings her comfort when actually…”</p><p>She huffed and slammed the ring box shut. “I just can’t watch it anymore.”</p><p>They didn’t discuss it any further until, in the darkness of Rio’s bedroom, with Alice laying just a couple feet away, the subject was raised again.</p><p>“I’m worried she’s manipulating you into crawling back to her. That maybe it’s all a show to get you to acquiesce and just be her piece on the side, always just waiting for her to choose you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed in the darkness, “I’m worried about that too.”</p><p>She felt Alice move beside her but remained where she was, staring up at the black ceiling. “Then why-…”</p><p>“Because I have to believe I can’t love someone this much and be fooled so completely. I have to believe in every look and every touch and know that she does love me. And so I’m giving her her comfort back. I want her to have comfort through this. Because my dad, and you, are mine, and she has Jen and Nicky… but she won’t sleep without me there and she won’t…” she swallowed and released a noise that made Alice reach for her arm, “I need to give her this comfort, Alice. At least until I can get the truth on Sunday.”</p><p>They didn’t speak after that.</p><p>Rio barely slept.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><p>In the morning, Miguel talked her down from a near panic attack, and Alice held her as he did.</p><p>All week she’d been talking herself up to doing what she knew she had to and now the day was finally here where she promised herself she’d do it and suddenly… she’d panicked.</p><p>What if Agatha had laughed in her face? What if she’d said “I’m a method actor, moron” and thrown Rio’s new ring in the trash? What if, worst of all, she’d taken it as a sign that Rio was petty and immature, because she’d been unable, when first asked, to simply pick a ring?</p><p>Miguel was good. Miguel talked her round, reminded her that Agatha was being patient, was listening to Rio, and going only as far as Rio would now allow. He told her that the Agatha he’d met was a woman who respected her so much that she’d spent the day with her family, choosing to speak to them in their language, choosing to wait for hours with the simple hope that she might catch even a glimpse of her.</p><p>He reminded her of something he’d been saying all week: “Hacemos cosas divertidas cuando tenemos miedo.” <em>We do funny things when we’re scared.</em></p><p>But now the scariest and worst thing had happened to the both of them because Agatha had been scared and now Agatha was trying to be brave. So Rio could be brave too. She could fix her mistake, and wait for Agatha to fix hers on Sunday.</p><p>By the time she was on set she was feeling more at peace, having foregone any caffeine for fear she’d was already too jumped up to handle it.</p><p>She left Alice at her trailer and walked the few yards to get to Agatha’s where after taking a few deep breaths she knocked lightly and then stepped back.</p><p>Jen answered the door within seconds and Rio wondered if Alice had warned her that she would be making a visit.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said, smiling a little. “Is Agatha-…?”</p><p>Agatha must have heard her because suddenly she was behind Jen, her hand on her arm to move her out of the way so she could see Rio better.</p><p>Her blue eyes cast out behind her and Rio knew she was checking to see if Alice had tagged along with her. She was glad she hadn’t allowed it.</p><p>“Can I speak to you? In… privately?”</p><p>Her gaze flitted over to Jen and she saw she looked torn but Agatha answered for her and Jen only looked over her shoulder at her: “Of course. Come in.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and stepped up and into the trailer, only to have Jen hold her wrist gently and shoot her a questioning look that Rio answered with a small nod. Jen left then, closing the door quietly behind herself.</p><p>Agatha’s trailer was different to hers. She’d gone with more of a colour scheme than Rio had. Where Rio’s was a jumble of colours with the simple aim of being cosy and warm, Agatha’s was much more of a theme.</p><p>She had browns and beiges, interspersed with some deep reds throughout. It wasn’t hard to miss that she also had pictures up, just like Rio had, only hers were of Nicky.</p><p>This was a place where Ralph didn’t exist.</p><p>As Rio took in the space she was aware of Agatha moving back on perch on the edge of the couch. She’d cleared her throat and in an unguarded voice said: “You’re ready to talk, honey?”</p><p>Mellifluous and soft, Agatha’s question caused her chest to ache suddenly, and Rio had to physically turn on the spot, had to take a slow breath in and an even slower one out before she said: “No, I… it’s… it’s something else.”</p><p>She turned back around and saw Agatha looking pale again, her hands twitching in that familiar way as she toyed with the ring on her left hand.</p><p>“I… it’s… that. I want to talk about <em>that</em>.”</p><p>She gestured vaguely to Agatha’s hands and Agatha immediately closed her eyes, immediately stopped the spinning and instead gripped her finger instead. “Okay. Okay. I wondered if you might ask me to… I just… it just makes me feel…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio whispered urgently, already knowing what Agatha was thinking. She moved over then and sank to her knees before her, reaching gently for her taught hands and carefully beginning to remove the ring. “It’s not…”</p><p>She stopped as she heard Agatha suck in a sharp breath as the ring was hovering over her knuckle, and decided she couldn’t be the one to remove it. She gently pushed it back down into place.</p><p>Her hands fell then, naturally landing on Agatha’s knees, finding their place without her thinking.</p><p>She took a breath, saw Agatha begin to spin the ring again, and lost all control of her words when she said: “That ring isn’t from me. It’s from Alice. Alice picked it for you. I couldn’t bring myself to do it and now you’ve been wearing it and I think you’ve been wearing it because you think I picked it for you but I didn’t. You’re not method. You don’t go method. So you must, you must, be wearing it because you think it’s mine and, and Agatha…”</p><p>She raised her gaze up and found Agatha’s eyes were closed, her lips parted, her brow furrowed. She looked as if she were concentrating hard, but on what, Rio didn’t know.</p><p>Rio raised up slowly and lifted her hands from Agatha’s knees to instead cup her face, and in doing so Agatha opened her eyes.</p><p>Rio’s front was pressed against Agatha’s legs, and the stretch was almost uncomfortable, if it weren’t done for the sole reason of trying to give Agatha some comfort.</p><p>“I just couldn’t bear to pick you a wedding-… I…”</p><p>Below her arms Agatha was removing her ring, creating a fist around it, her eyes still on Rio. “It’s okay. It’s stupid anyway. I just-…”</p><p>“It’s not stupid,” Rio said quickly, pulling back to uncurl Agatha’s fingers around the ugly ring that she’d hated since she first saw it. “This one just isn’t right for you.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a shaky breath and Rio turned to place the shiny offender on the coffee table. She’d return it to Stevie later, and made a mental note to check in on Alice’s taste before she ever bought a ring for Jen.</p><p>“If you’ll let me, a couple days ago I chose you a different ring. One I think suits you better, one I-…” but in looking around again, she saw that Agatha was struggling, that her face had collapsed down and her head with it.</p><p>So Rio sat up again, and she lifted Agatha’s face to see her eyes. She didn’t want her to hide, couldn’t <em>bear</em> her hiding anything anymore. “Will you let me? Give you another ring?”</p><p>It took a second, a second of just staring, a second of losing herself in Agatha’s hypnotic blue eyes. But Agatha had moved her hands cautiously to hold her wrists and sucked in a breath before she said, “I don’t want something you don’t want to give me, Rio. I shouldn’t have forced it. I shouldn’t have-…”</p><p>“I want to give you a ring, Agatha.”</p><p>Before Agatha could say anything else she pulled her right hand away and as she was reaching down into her pocket she felt the soft brush of Agatha’s lips against her left palm. She stopped to look and saw something that she’d never get over. Agatha was pressing her whole face into her hand, nuzzling into it as though she’d woken in the middle of the night and Rio was the soft, cool pillow beneath her head.</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled inwards, holding Agatha in place. And the woman just turned her head more, pressed closer, cradled Rio right back as she held her.</p><p>Rio’s free hand curled around the metal that was warm now, having been carried around in her pocket all morning. She bit the inside of her cheek and as she did, Agatha slowly turned back to her, her cheeks flushed as if she’d been caught.</p><p>“I hope you like it,” she said lamely, aware now of their positioning, that she was on her knees brandishing a ring.</p><p>Agatha blinked slowly and to Rio it looked as if she were suddenly nervous but she turned to look at the ring held out to her and she bit down on her lower lip when she saw it.</p><p>She didn’t reach for it though and Rio didn’t know what to do so she stood slowly and Agatha’s eyes flickered back to her in panic, watching as she stood to her full height.</p><p>After a second, Agatha stood with her, and she held her left hand out, splaying her fingers so Rio could slip the diamond onto her ring finger. It was the perfect fit, the perfect match, and looked more at home on Agatha’s hand than the pear shaped diamond ever had.</p><p>They both stared at it, Agatha’s fingers now curling gently around Rio’s hand, and Rio toyed with the diamond, making sure it was perfectly straight on Agatha’s finger.</p><p>The moment was heavier than Rio was expecting. The ring carried more meaning than she could bear. But she found she wanted it to mean even more than it did. She wanted to be buried under the weight of the diamond.</p><p>She wanted it to add weight to Agatha’s hand so that every time she held it she knew she was hers.</p><p>“Christmas wives,” Agatha murmured, her voice taking on a soft timbre as Rio looked up to meet her gaze. She looked calmer now, as if the new ring had tempered whatever tempest was raging behind sea-blue eyes.</p><p>Her lips twitched a little, curving up into a timid smile, and Rio’s eyes fell to them and she hesitated for a moment, torn between kissing them and smiling back.</p><p>Agatha must have felt Rio’s indecision because her smile faded and she leant in to instead kiss Rio’s cheek. It was so close. So damn close to the corner of her mouth that it had to be deliberate.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t pushing. She hadn’t pushed Rio, or tried to, since the arrival of her bag and the empanadas. But Rio found her wanting to now. Because if Agatha simply kissed her then Rio wouldn’t be living with the torment of wanting to and keeping herself from doing it constantly.</p><p>She wanted Agatha to make the decision for them both. To decide that everything was fine now, that they would be okay, that they would keep kissing and be together forever.</p><p>Though she knew that would never work.</p><p>And she wanted this to work, so she had to wait.</p><p>In two more days she’d have her answers and she’d be able to make a decision.</p><p>In her heart’s secret whispers she knew the decision would always and forever just be <em>Agatha</em>. But secrecy and whispers weren’t good enough anymore. She had to pick Agatha loudly, and Agatha had to pick her the same.</p><p>So as Agatha pulled away Rio was able to smile because she had hope burning away in the cradle of her chest.</p><p>“Christmas wives,” she echoed back to Agatha, letting the two words float between them and into the universe as a half-formed wish.</p><p>“I should go,” she said quietly, watching as Agatha’s face fell a little but she managed to incline her head in acknowledgement.</p><p>Rio looked away before she could change her mind and stooped to steal back Alice’s choice of ring. It felt cold and wrong in her hand so she shoved it deep into her pocket, took one last look at Agatha, and left her alone in the middle of the trailer, spinning her new ring.</p><p>That night, Rio spoke to her dad for over an hour. He mostly listened, he mostly let Rio talk and talk and talk. She spoke of having never wanted to be settled, of never thinking she <em>would</em>. She asked if when Miguel had met Anna it had been like a lightning strike or a slow tide pulling them in.</p><p>She said she was ready for it. Ready for it all.</p><p>And in two days time she wanted to hear all of what Agatha had to give. She wanted the bad and the good and everything in between.</p>

<p>After giving Agatha her ring, Rio slept like a baby.</p><p>For the first time in days now, she woke up feeling, even slightly, refreshed.</p><p>Alice didn’t know what to do with herself. But Rio didn’t mind that Alice had backed off a little in the time it took them to get showered and changed and head to set. She’d spent the evening with her rehashing the scene in Agatha’s trailer.</p><p>Alice had cried at one point and Rio had found that she’d had to be the one to comfort <em>her</em> for a change. Alice had never really admitted why but Rio had put two and two together and got to five.</p><p>For years Alice had endured Rio’s revolving door of women, and now she was going out of her way to give her fake wife the perfect fake engagement ring, even as her heart lay broken in her chest.</p><p>And her best friend had cried about it. Yeah, she got to five pretty easily.</p><p>But she’d dried Alice’s tears, then recounted the entire story again to her dad, and she’d fallen asleep exhausted and feeling a little better than she had been the night before.</p><p>So the journey to work didn’t feel quite as tough. The walk to her trailer with her cup of coffee didn’t feel so painful. The sight of Agatha’s trailer, just two down from her own, didn’t sting nearly as much as it usually did.</p><p>Perhaps this is what her dad had been talking about. “El corazón tarda en sanar, cariño. Pero cuando sane, lo sabrás.” <em>The heart takes time to heal, sweetheart. But when it does, you’ll know.</em></p><p>She took half an hour to just relax, bothering Alice by stretching out on the couch and taking most of the space. Her task today was to be around for when she was needed, if she was needed. Maria had designated this a “free day” for rehearsals of any and every scene she wanted testing before they moved into filming the next week.</p><p>Rio would be needed in the afternoon, but not the morning. Only it still meant she had to hang around in the morning “just in case”.</p><p>It was bullshit.</p><p>She hated days like these. She hated the waiting and the lounging. She wanted to be moving and doing something. And perhaps it was the fact that she’d had a full eight hours sleep but she needed to get out of this trailer.</p><p>Now.</p><p>“I’m going to find that basketball hoop one of the guys told me about.”</p><p>“Which guy?”</p><p>Rio scoffed but shot her friend a look. She didn’t know “which guy” but she knew he was friendly and carried a walkie talkie. So crew. A friendly guy on the crew.</p><p>“It’s down the back of the lot,” Rio settled on as she swung her legs over the couch. “Are you coming?”</p><p>“No, I think I should stay and hold the fort down. You know… be the adult.”</p><p>“Come on! A few hoops? A quick game? Alice!”</p><p>“Jesus, you have a good night’s sleep and you become a monster again.”</p><p>Rio laughed and went into the little bedroom off the main living space to source the basketball she’d spotted there earlier in the week. “You want me to wither away?”</p><p>“I want you to eat a good breakfast first, please. I saw you pushing your food around last night. <em>And</em> you keep ignoring the very specific bagel I have delivered here every morning.”</p><p>Rio huffed and began to bounce the ball as she came back into the room. Using the rhythm of it to calm herself for a few seconds before she caught the ball and without warning tossed it to Alice who only just managed to catch it.</p><p>“Fine. A bagel and then a game?”</p><p>“I’m not playing with you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but made strides to the wrapped bagel on the side. “Are you really going to hold the fort down or are you going to call Jen over and fool around in my bed?”</p><p>She didn’t need to turn around to know Alice was blushing. She took a large bite of her lukewarm bagel as Alice said: “I would <em>never</em> fool around in your bed.” There was a pause as Rio chewed, “The couch on the other hand…”</p><p>Rio almost choked on her breakfast but managed to swallow before it got lodged properly in her throat. “Pervert.”</p><p>Alice laughed as Rio continued to eat, hunched over the sink like a gremlin. But she finished the bagel in record time and washed it down with her now lukewarm coffee. It settled heavily in her stomach. So heavily that she stomped back over to Alice and lay down on the couch again.</p><p>“I ate too much.”</p><p>“<em>No</em> you’ve been eating too little for days. You need to stop that.”</p><p>“You know I-…”</p><p>“Don’t eat when stressed, yes. But… it’s been a long time. Your mom’s been texting me to check in on how much you’re eating.”</p><p>Rio sighed and hid behind her hands.</p><p>“Remember what you told me about how you felt about seeing Agatha not eating?”</p><p>“Mmm… shut up.”</p><p>“Well you need to eat too.”</p><p>Rio grumbled and dropped her hands from her face. The ceiling above was an off-white, and bore the small circles of lights that gave either too much light or nothing at all. She counted every bulb until Alice interrupted her.</p><p>“You wanna talk about tomorrow?”</p><p>“No. I wanna digest and then I’m going to find that hoop.”</p><p>Alice hummed and Rio closed her eyes. The concept of tomorrow was another reason for Rio wanting to get some of her newfound energy out.</p><p>She wanted to run the court until she couldn’t breathe, to jump and shoot until her legs ached and her arms felt like jello. Anything to not think about the nerves that were beginning to bubble away now that “Sunday” had turned into “tomorrow”.</p><p>She couldn’t lie around anymore.</p><p>She threw herself up and scooped the basketball up from the side. “Last chance, loser. Want to come?”</p><p>“No, I’ve already text Jen that I’ll soon have an empty couch.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes as she went to the door and turned to Alice as she opened it, “Phone’s in my pocket. But if on the off-chance I don’t answer it,” it was Alice’s turn to roll her eyes, “I’ll be at the back of the lot. Northwestern corner, apparently.”</p><p>Alice hummed her goodbye and waved Rio out the door. She stepped out with a grin into the cool air of the bright day. Two steps and then her feet were on the floor, two breaths, a turn, and then.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Her heart stopped. She knew that voice. She knew that if she turned to the right and looked down two trailers, she’d see the little boy with the same face as hers.</p><p>She hadn’t been prepared for it. She hadn’t been <em>remotely</em> prepared for it.</p><p>She swallowed, realised she’d been stood still for longer than was normal, and then her body began to simply carry her away even as, on the wind, another call sounded.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio kept stepping, kept putting one foot in front of the other.</p><p>She’d counted five of them and then came the third shout, accompanied by heavy, frantic footsteps.</p><p>“Melliza!”</p><p>Rio stopped what she was doing. She stopped moving. Stopped breathing.</p><p>She turned around.</p><p>Nicky was charging towards her, wearing a green Celtics sweater with the hood bouncing along behind him. He looked desperate, his eyes wide even as his brow was furrowed, and Rio dropped the ball in her hands to catch him as he crashed into her.</p><p>The impact, on her heart more than her body, was immediate. Nicky was clinging to her, breathing fast and heavy, and Rio clung to him back.</p><p>“Hey, mellizo.”</p><p>She kissed the side of his head and pulled away to crouch properly and look up at him, fix his sweater properly about his neck, hiding her panic in the gentle adjustments.</p><p>“You didn’t stop.”</p><p>“No, sweetheart. I’m sorry, I was…” Agatha came into view then, stopping just beside Nicky and placing her hand on his head. “I didn’t hear you, I’m sorry.”</p><p>She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her as she dropped her hands to Nicky’s arms and smiled as best she could, “I was just off to shoot some hoops. You wanna join?”</p><p>Nicky was eyeing her, his frown still in place, his shrewd brown eyes more discerning and probing than she’d ever seen them. They made her feel ashamed; ashamed she’d turned away, ashamed she’d kept walking, ashamed she’d lied about it.</p><p>“You want me to?”</p><p>“Sí, mellizo.”</p><p>Rio raised her gaze to Agatha then and saw that she too was focusing on her son but that she looked at Rio when Rio looked to her. Agatha gave a tentative smile and Rio looked back to Nicky.</p><p>She knew Agatha knew she’d heard him.</p><p>She knew Agatha knew she’d walked away.</p><p>She cleared her throat quietly and tugged gently on the strings of Nicky’s sweater.</p><p>“This new?”</p><p>“Mama said I could have an early birthday present. Rio, why did you not stop?”</p><p>Rio frowned a little, feeling the heat rise in her cheeks. Her mind began to swirl and make her feel dizzy as she balanced on her toes and continued to fiddle with the strings of Nicky’s sweater.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said softly, now crouching down to be level with Rio, “You know Rio would never ignore you. She’s your melliza, right?”</p><p>It was worse that Agatha was lying for her too. Much worse.</p><p>But Rio swallowed, and looked up into the face that was so like hers but much more innocent, much softer. “Lo siento, mellizo,” she breathed out, “I didn’t hear.”</p><p>When she smiled a little Nicky’s shoulders relaxed and he briefly looked to his mom before he turned back to Rio and nodded cautiously, his little hand reaching to touch her hair. “Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?” Rio said softly, trying to perk herself up and swallow down the panic that still threatened to consume her, “You want to play some ball?”</p><p>“Sí, melliza.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio smiled, glancing at Agatha but purposefully avoiding her gaze, “That okay, mama?”</p><p>She bit her lip, flushed the bright pink she’d been fighting off earlier and cleared her throat. Out of the corner of her eye she could see Agatha fighting a smile, “That’s okay with me. I have to go rehearse though so…”</p><p>“He can stick with me all morning. I don’t think I’m needed until this afternoon but have to hang around just in case. Alice said she’d reach out if I’m needed.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and stood quickly and for a second the world span and she felt like she might be spinning with it but she remained standing and soon Agatha was standing with her, an anchoring hand on her back.</p><p>“You sure? Jen said-…”</p><p>“Oh, I think Jen has plans with Alice.”</p><p>She looked up then and caught Agatha’s eye, and found her arching a brow and smirking just a little. She felt her fist the fabric of her shirt in her hand and as Nicky ran away to fetch the ball back Agatha lowered her voice, suddenly serious, and asked, “You ignored him?”</p><p>“I…,” Rio began, searching for the right words and deciding on the truth, “I panicked.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at where Nicky was and looked back as Rio added, “It won’t happen again. You know I-…”</p><p>“Rio, I should have warned you. His nanny got sick and… I had to bring him. I figured he’d be in my trailer all day.”</p><p>“I’m pleased he’s here.”</p><p>“Are you?”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t mad, at least, she didn’t look it. She instead looked… nervous?</p><p>Rio only had time to nod because Nicky was back with them and had the basketball cradled to his chest with his right hand seeking Rio’s left. “Can we go?”</p><p>“Yes, kid. Let’s go.”</p><p>“Ah!” Agatha dropped down to place several quick kisses to Nicky’s cheek and made him squirm happily as she tugged his hoodie a little closer around his neck. “Be good, keep warm. Stay close to Rio, okay?”</p><p>“Yes, mama. Close to Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled and wasn’t expecting Agatha to then sweep up and pull her head against her own, her fingers clutching at her hair as she whispered against her ear so Nicky couldn’t hear, “there’s no one I’d trust more with him than you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed as Agatha pulled away and when they met eyes she felt something lurch in her chest that was different to panic. It felt a lot like pride. And as Agatha pulled away it turned into pining.</p><p>She turned to Nicky, and saw him watching her closely, his brow still more furrowed than it should be for a little boy but she steered him in the direction she thought they should be going and left Agatha to watch them leave.</p><p>This was fine.</p><p>Totally fine.</p><p>It was just Nicky.</p><p>Agatha’s son.</p><p>The boy she’d been told was on this earth because Agatha had wanted Rio so much she’d had sex with her husband and… manifested a boy exactly in her likeness.</p><p>Totally, utterly, fine.</p><p>She cleared her throat, willed the panic and pining away.</p><p>“Early birthday, huh? When <em>is</em> your birthday?”</p><p>“In two weeks,” Nicky said proudly, his frown disappearing all of a sudden as he trotted alongside Rio and dropped her hand to hold the ball up to her. “I turn eight.”</p><p>“Nooooo,” Rio laughed, “you’ve got to be closer to eighty two.”</p><p>Nicky laughed, “That is so silly!”</p><p>Rio hummed and bit the inside of her cheek, pleased Nicky had done a one eighty since he’d first collided with her.</p><p>“Okay, kid,” she announced as she tossed the ball between her hands and Nicky hurried alongside her, “very serious decision to be made. You wanna play with me to see how many hoops we can get as a team or you wanna play against me and see who gets the most?”</p><p>“Umm,” Nicky said with a deep frown as he lifted his hand up to tuck it around Rio’s elbow. She stopped throwing the ball. “With you. I wanna see if we can get to a thousand.”</p><p>“A thousand?!”</p><p>“Si!”</p><p>Rio laughed and glanced down at Nicky with a smirk, “Oh, easy! We are <em>so</em> gonna hit a thousand!”</p><p>But a noise behind her made her glance over her shoulder and Nicky looked too. Little James was hanging off his mom’s hand, having just stepped from his own trailer, straining to get to them.</p><p>“Mama Rio! Mama Riooooooo!”</p><p>Something like dread settled in the pit of Rio’s stomach as a little hand gripped her elbow tighter and a small voice said, “Mama Rio?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down into wide brown eyes and saw that all the joy had disappeared from Nicky’s soft features in less than the time it had taken for James to sound her name. “He’s playing Luca, mine and your mom’s son in the movie.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Rio didn’t have time to explain further as a cannonball of a child flew its way towards them, his mother trailing along behind. James threw himself at Rio and head butted her in the process but didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>Nicky stepped back a little and Rio, a little winded, transferred the ball to one hand so she could reach for James with her other. “Well, hey kid.”</p><p>“Sorry about that!” James’s mom caught up with them and gently pried her son off of Rio. “He gets so excited, you know.”</p><p>“Oh, I know.”</p><p>James was practically vibrating in front of his mother, doing a strange sort of jig on the spot. Nicky just watched him with a look of slight distain on his face and Rio took his hand back and squeezed it.</p><p>“This is Nicky, James. We’re just going to play some ball and-…”</p><p>“Oh you’re a sweetheart for asking!”</p><p>Rio blinked, wondered where she’d even remotely asked anything, but it was too late. Clearly his mom wanted a rest. “He’d love to! Get some energy out before later, you know.”</p><p>No, Rio didn’t know. But she was suddenly left alone with two little boys - one still bouncing on his feet, the other now pressing into her side.</p><p>“Right,” she took a deep breath, “let’s go then.”</p><p>She turned them around, motioning with her head for James to follow. And he did. Until he got bored and decided running ahead was more fun.</p><p>“Careful!” Rio shouted after the tearaway and found an echo from beside her as Nicky tried to help: “Be careful! Rio says be careful!”</p><p>But James just continued to run and Rio had to stop herself from rolling her eyes or simply leaving him to run under he tired out as she shouted after him again to make him change directions and follow them to the little basketball court at the very edge of the lot.</p><p>They were behind the big studio building now, and dotted nearby were some lights and other equipment that usually lived on the sets, placed here for safekeeping. The court was a half court, but more than big enough for Rio and the two boys to get some of their energy out.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>Thankfully, no one was there and little James had actually followed and was now streaking towards the hoop. The whole time Nicky had been silent, the pep in his step gone now, his small hand clutching at Rio’s.</p><p>“Okay!” Rio announced, being used to herding small children around but ones that she <em>actually</em> had love for because they were family - or Nicky - and not one very small brown-haired boy who was cute but a handful.</p><p>She wished Agatha were here. Agatha would know what to do.</p><p>“No rules, just fun. We wanna score as much as possible to get to a thousand.”</p><p>She turned to Nicky and grinned as she offered him the ball, “You first. Let’s see those skills, kid.”</p><p>James was rushing his way back over as Nicky began to dribble the ball and Rio intercepted him and swung him under her arm so Nicky could bounce around and take a shot at the hoop.</p><p>James squealed in midair as Nicky took a shot.</p><p>Rio placed him down again as Nicky scored and she hollered her appreciation and ran over to shake Nicky’s shoulders, “Champion!!”</p><p>Nicky laughed as he turned to Rio, his grin back again, but shyer this time. “So silly.”</p><p>“No, so talented!”</p><p>There was a noise of exertion and Rio looked around to see that James had flung the ball away and was giggling as he watched it.</p><p>Rio did roll her eyes this time.</p><p>“James!” She left Nicky as his grin faded and went to the smaller boy’s side. “That’s not how we play, okay? You gotta throw it to me or Nicky. And I’ll try and help you shoot, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” James agreed as Rio turned to where the ball was slowly rolling away. “Will you go fetch it for me please?”</p><p>“Okay, mama Rio!”</p><p>James ran after the ball and Rio sighed as she went back over to a patient Nicky, waiting quietly in the middle of the court. She smiled at him and he smiled back and Rio went to drape her arm over his shoulders as she said: “Maybe you can help James shoot? Teach him what you know?”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky agreed quietly, holding tight to the back of Rio’s shirt. “Why is he calling you mama Rio? You’re not his mama.”</p><p>“He’s little,” Rio said quietly, watching as James began to toddle over with the ball in his hands. “It’s sometimes easier for younger actors to keep the pretend going.”</p><p>Nicky nodded but Rio caught his frown as James arrived before them and bounced the ball heavily by his feet. Rio caught it as it came down again and said: “Right, James, let’s get you a basket. Do you know how to dribble?”</p><p>The worst question to ask an overactive child, it turned out.</p><p>“No!” Rio bellowed suddenly and then laughed as James sucked his spit back up.</p><p>Nicky did not laugh.</p><p>“C’mere,” she pulled away from Nicky and led James to the hoop and offered him the ball once more as Nicky followed her over and hovered by her elbow. “Want to take a shot?”</p><p>James grinned as he took the ball and seemed to think about it for a while before he simply threw the ball in the opposite direction and began to giggle again. Rio huffed softly but knew a reaction was exactly what James was after so she bit her tongue.</p><p>“<em>James</em>.”</p><p>She left him to jog over and find the ball and when she returned, James was still delighted and Nicky was still frowning.</p><p>“You’re being naughty,” Nicky accused as James laughed some more and patted Nicky’s forehead which made Nicky stumble back and Rio bend down between them, moving a hand to hold Nicky’s shoulder.</p><p>“Okay. No more throwing away, alright? We want to play.”</p><p>“Okay!” James said happily and Rio eyed him for a second before she turned to give Nicky the ball, “Your turn, champ. Show us what you got.”</p><p>Nicky smiled shyly and bounced the ball and Rio held James back where he’d been trying to slap it away but Nicky had turned and was about to get it closer to the hoop. He took a shot and missed this time but Rio cheered all the same and only released James when Nicky had turned back around with his frown in place.</p><p>“He distracted me,” he accused as Rio sighed and kissed Nicky’s temple. “He’s annoying.”</p><p>“I know,” she said quietly, watching James purposefully kick the ball every few feet as he tried to pick it up. “But it’s important to play nice.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio noticed his lips pursing slightly as James ran back with the ball now held out before him, “Mama Rio! Mama Rio! I got it! I got it!”</p><p>“Well done, kid.”</p><p>Rio took the ball and released a soft ‘oof’ as James flung himself at her afterwards. She patted his back and laughed, “Okay, are you gonna play properly now? Not throw this away?”</p><p>“Yes yes.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Rio nudged James gently off of her and watched the following happen in slow motion:</p><p>James took the ball.</p><p>James grinned at her.</p><p>He shouted, “Mama Rio!”</p><p>He turned with the ball.</p><p>He ran straight to the hoop.</p><p>He threw the ball directly behind it.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes for just a second and when she opened them she saw that Nicky was already running after it.</p><p>“<em>James</em>!” Rio shouted again, watching the little boy descend into giggles as the ball rolled away. She sighed, wondering how she’d be able to deposit James quickly back with his mother.</p><p>Rio watched Nicky go for a second before she went over to kneel before James and plead with him: “Hey, this is Nicky’s game too. You can’t keep throwing the ball away, alright?”</p><p>“S’funny,” James gasped out between giggles and Rio rolled her eyes as she turned to see Nicky’s progress back to them.</p><p>He was running with the ball held in his two hands, his little brow furrowed, his lips tight, his brown eyes fighting back the tears that were clearly threatening to overspill.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio exclaimed, spinning properly to open her arms out to the boy. He dropped the ball the moment she did and threw himself against her with so much force that Rio almost lost her balance.</p><p>“What’s wrong, kid?”</p><p>James beside them had stopped giggling now but was nudging at Nicky’s arm and announcing, “He’s cryyyyyiiiiiing!”</p><p>Rio frowned as she held Nicky tighter to her with one arm and used to other to point in the direction of the ball now slowly rolling away. She snapped without meaning to, and only held tighter to Nicky: “James, go fetch the ball and bring it back.”</p><p>“He-…” Nicky began between soft sniffs and the tears that were soaking Rio’s collar. “He, he… k-keeps throwing it a-and… I want… I want…”</p><p>Unaffected by Rio’s chastisement, delighted giggles escaped James as he rushed after the ball and Rio saw him continually kick it in his attempts to catch it again. But she was rubbing Nicky’s back now, trying to calm him down as he hid against her.</p><p>“He’s stupid! I-… he… he…”</p><p>Rio pulled away even as Nicky tried to cling on and she gently wiped his tears first with her thumbs and then with her shirt as she pulled it up to dry them.</p><p>“It’s okay, Nicky. He’s being-…”</p><p>“He’s stupid!” Nicky shouted properly this time, wheeling around and stamping his foot with his fists at his sides when James cackled as he finally captured the ball and tossed it further away.</p><p>“S-stupid! I hate him!”</p><p>Rio stood and squeezed Nicky’s shoulder as she marched past him to grab James and scoop him up into her arms. “Absolutely not,” she said firmly as James squealed now he was in the air, squirming as Rio kept a firm grip on him.</p><p>“Now we’re either going to play nice or-…”</p><p>“I’m not playing with h-him!” Nicky had the hiccups now. “I hate you, James! I hate you!”</p><p>“Baby,” Rio cooed softly, feeling the panic begin to rise in her again now James was cackling where he sat against her hip, his sticky hands playing with her hair, and Nicky continued to cry in front of them.</p><p>“Rio is m-my melliza! Go!” He ran forwards and tried to push James out of Rio’s arms which made James giggle more and Rio have to angle him away. “Go! Away!”</p><p>“Mama Rio! Mama Rio!”</p><p>“No! No! No!”</p><p>“Nicky, sweetheart,” Rio gave in on Nicky’s third attempt to get James out of her arms and with some difficulty she lowered the smaller boy to the ground and disentangled his hands from her hair. “Be gentle. He’s only little.”</p><p>But this wasn’t the right thing to saw to another little boy unable to control his frustration anymore.</p><p>James was still giggling, watching Nicky in amusement as Nicky stomped his foot again and pressed his little fists into his streaming eyes, “H-he’s r-ruining i-it.”</p><p>Rio now had a hold on the back of James’ shirt so he couldn’t run again but with her free hand she pulled Nicky back in and hugged him close, letting him cry it out against her shoulder as he made fists in her shirt.</p><p>“Está bien, cariño,” Rio whispered into his ear, “Te tengo, mi mellizo.” <em>It’s okay, sweetheart. I’ve got you, my twin.</em></p><p>Nicky nodded a little against her and Rio held him tighter, briefly looking up to see some of the crew who’d been nearby taking in the sight of an Oscar-winning actress fighting for her life with two very different little boys.</p><p>“James,” Rio said in as gentle a voice as she could muster as James began again to play with her hair, “Let’s take you back to your mom, okay?”</p><p>“Hmmmmm,” James hummed, “no stay with mama Rio.”</p><p>Nicky sniffed loudly and lifted his head to place his wet, snotty face in against Rio’s cheek. He reached around her to push at James’ grabbing hands and huffed out a hot breath against Rio’s skin. “No. You can’t. N-no. Go back to y-your mama.”</p><p>“Mama Rio!” James gigged again and Rio released her hold on him to help disentangle his fingers from her hair, aware that where one boy was being gentle and the other was not, they were still now both very much tugging at her hair.</p><p>“Come on, let’s go find your mom.”</p><p>“Chico estúpido,” Nicky muttered under his breath as he stopped trying to push Nicky away and instead clung to Rio as she stood. It almost made Rio smile. Almost.</p><p>But now she had both boys by her sides, one still trying to dry his tears with the hand that wasn’t gripping Rio’s and the other now skipping as he chanted “mama Rio” over and over again.</p><p>Rio glanced down at Nicky and saw his brow was still drawn, his lips pursed, and he looked more like his mother than she’d ever seen. It was clear he was fighting himself to not say anything to shut James up but silence could only last so long for him when James belted out one last “mama Rioooooooo!”</p><p>Nicky ripped his hand suddenly from Rio’s hold and made Rio stop and turn as the little boy she’d only ever seen calm and happy, sometimes serious and mature, had a full on meltdown in the middle of the lot.</p><p>“STOP IT STOP IT SHE IS NOT YOUR MAMA SHE IS MINE RIO IS M-MINE STOP IT!”</p><p>That shut James up.</p><p>Rio released the thunderstruck James and ducked down to lift Nicky into her arms. He was bigger than James so it required more effort but he didn’t fight or wriggle like James had and instead began to sob against her more violently than he had before.</p><p>She held his head against her neck and shushed him gently as she turned to James and with more ferocity than before said, “Come on. <em>Now</em>. We’re taking you back to your mom.”</p><p>James kowtowed and took Rio’s outstretched hand and Rio walked with them both until they arrived at James’ trailer. She let go of James and let him knock, aware now that there was an audience of cast and crew alike all watching the little show as Nicky hid himself against her and James climbed the three steps up to knock on his door.</p><p>As they waited for his mom Rio tugged Nicky’s hood up over his head to give him some more comfort and privacy. His mom answered shortly after and for that, Rio was grateful.</p><p>“Mom mom mom!” James chanted as he wrapped himself around his mom’s legs and Rio exchanged a pointed look with her.</p><p>“They had a disagreement,” she explained, “James wouldn’t let Nicky play.”</p><p>The mother looked a little abashed and swallowed as an Oscar-winner glowered up at her, “Right… I’ll… have a word.”</p><p>“Please do.”</p><p>She turned away and walked as quickly as she could with Nicky still cradled in her arms. She got to Agatha’s trailer, five down from James’ and didn’t even knock before walking in.</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Someone shouted from the bedroom and Rio rolled her eyes as she slammed the door shut behind them. Jen appeared not two seconds later, and Alice tow seconds after that. Rio didn’t even blink as she asked, “Where’s Agatha?”</p><p>“With… with Maria. She’s rehearsing. What happened?”</p><p>Rio shook her head silently as she moved over to gently encourage Nicky to sit on the sofa. But he didn’t seem to want to leave the safety of the nook he’d created for himself so she straightened up again for fear she’d topple over.</p><p>“Nicky? You okay, buddy?”</p><p>Nicky didn’t respond to Alice and Rio just paced, rubbing his back as he began to calm down and his breathing slowly evened out. When he moved his head so he could peak out from beneath his hood and blink around at Jen, Rio spoke again. “It’s just us. Just me, Alice, and Jen.”</p><p>Nicky nodded against her and Rio felt sick as she gently lowered him to the floor and this time he allowed it. When he was on his own two feet he fisted at his eyes and Rio sank to her knees before him. “James is just a little kid, Nicky. But I’m sorry he ruined your game.”</p><p>“This is about James?” Jen interrupted, her wide eyes still full of panic and Rio knew she was half a mind to either call an ambulance or call her client.</p><p>“I just wanted,” Nicky sniffed and Rio brushed his hair back from his forehead, pushing his hood off in the process. “He made me a-angry.”</p><p>Rio nodded and scanned over the face that was so like hers, doing her best to wipe away the tear tracks that lined his soft cheeks. “I know, sweetheart.”</p><p>“I h-hate him,” Nicky admitted again as fresh tears began to fall and Rio pulled him back in for a hug. “I h-hate that he h-has my mama and I h-hate that he has y-you and I h-hate that he c-calls you m-mama Rio a-and…”</p><p>Rio shushed Nicky softly and over his shoulder as she stroked over his hair she mouthed ‘Agatha’ at Jen. Jen nodded and grabbed Alice's hand to pull her with her to disappear and quickly and quietly from the trailer and Rio sighed out heavily as Nicky cried some more.</p><p>“You know it’s all pretend, right? Your mama is only <em>your</em> mama, not James’. And I’m not anybody’s mama. I’m just-…”</p><p>“My m-melliza,” Nicky said with a hiccup as Rio rubbed his back.</p><p>“Yes. Your melliza.”</p><p>It took a couple minutes but Nicky’s tears calmed again and just as Rio was pulling back to dry them properly the door burst open and Agatha appeared looking frantic and afraid.</p><p>She’d fallen to her knees beside them before Rio could even say anything and Nicky flung himself into her arms as Rio rested back against her ankles and smiled sadly at the sight.</p><p>“What’s wrong, honey? What happened?”</p><p>Nicky sniffled and spoke in a muffled voice as he pressed into Agatha and Agatha’s wide eyes swung round to watch Rio. “H-he k-kept being s-stupid and we couldn’t p-play properly a-and then he he kept calling Rio m-mama R-Rio. I h-hate him. I don’t want, I don’t want him to call y-you mama.. I don’t w-want… R-Rio is not <em>his</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes closed as Rio reached out to squeeze Nicky’s shoulder and she felt the sickness she’d felt earlier. Because Nicky was still so upset and because there was nothing she could do about it. Maybe she'd done everything wrong. Maybe she'd not protected him enough, maybe she'd not shown him enough care.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha tried quietly, “baby, I’m no one’s mama but yours, okay? No one is taking me away from you.”</p><p>Rio dropped her hand and slowly, and as silently as she could, she stood to give the little family their space. She went and sat on the edge of the couch, scratching absently at her damp neck to rid herself of the uncomfortable itch that comes from irritated, warm skin.</p><p>She kept her gaze down on the floor, going over everything in her mind and wondering if there was something she could have done better. Should she have intervened earlier before Nicky got so upset? Should she have been firmer with James or simply refused to let him play?</p><p>Agatha was talking to Nicky softly where they still sat on the floor together and Nicky was whispering back but about what, Rio didn’t know.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha called out, making Rio turn to them both and see that Nicky was leaning against his mom but looking over at her too. “Nicky wants to ask you something.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched as Agatha gently encouraged Nicky to turn properly and Rio followed the movements of his little fist as rubbed at his right eye.</p><p>“Can you come back please?”</p><p>“Come back?”</p><p>“Here please.”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha and saw her attention was on her son still so she couldn’t gage how she felt about this, but then she saw her swallow thickly and she dropped her gaze to the floor.</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>Rio moved slowly across and fell to her knees again in front of Nicky, waiting to see if what he wanted was something what would hurt her so intensely that she didn’t think she’d recover.</p><p>It turned out it was.</p><p>Nicky was already turning around to hug his mom again and he glanced over his shoulder at Rio, and Rio just knew he wanted her to join. So as Agatha raised her arms to welcome her into the embrace she sucked in a sharp breath and pressed in close.</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered in her chest as she looped her own arms around Nicky’s little body and Agatha’s larger one. The two women sandwiched the little boy between them and Rio instinctively pressed her face into Agatha’s cheek, closing her eyes as she felt Nicky wriggle to get comfortable and then settle as the pressure of the hug relaxed him down.</p><p>They remained still like that for a while and Rio wondered why they’d never done this before. Why she hadn’t insisted that her day start and end with a hug like this.</p><p>She’d have driven miles and miles to get to this. She'd have swam through shark-infested waters, or fought a million demons, just to get to this.</p><p>She’d have endured hours of James screaming just to collapse into Agatha’s embrace with her son sandwiched comfortably between them.</p><p>But Nicky needed to breathe almost as much as he needed the comfort and he began to wriggle again until Rio pulled away and Agatha’s hold on her relaxed and then fell as she sat back on her ankles.</p><p>Nicky followed Rio’s movements and sat back against her lap as she settled against her own ankles and he turned to look up at her with that familiar serious expression as she held him gently around his middle.</p><p>“If you are pretend married then I think you should be my pretend mama too. <em>Not</em> James’.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and looked up at Agatha for a second who suddenly looked pale again. But Rio cleared her throat, put on her best smile and said, “Oh yeah? What happened to being your melliza?”</p><p>“You can’t have my mama without me too.”</p><p><em>You didn’t ask about Nicky’s middle name.</em></p><p><em>What?</em></p><p><em>His middle name.</em></p><p><em>His…? What is it?</em></p><p><em>River.</em></p><p>The pain was unlike anything she’d felt since those unbearable minutes when Agatha was shouting and Rio’s heart was freshly breaking.</p><p>Nicky was looking up at her with those molten chocolate eyes and she could only smile, only squeeze him a little tighter, only lean into the touch of his hand as he reached back and up to hold her cheek.</p><p>“I suppose that’s true.”</p><p>“Say it please.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha said softly, shuffling closer to reach for Nicky’s knees, “Why don’t you go get cleaned up and we’ll get some lunch, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio let him go so he could run away to go and wash his hands and face and suddenly they were alone for the first time since the Rio had swapped Agatha’s ring. Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s knees now and said in a quiet voice, “What happened?”</p><p>“James kept screaming and giggling and he wouldn’t play properly and Nicky was being so good and so helpful and then he just… he started to cry and I held him but James wouldn’t stop and Nicky got so angry and…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha reassured quietly, shuffling closer until her hands were no longer on Rio’s knees but on her thighs, and sliding ever up until her fingers were curling around her hips, “he’s okay. You’re okay.”</p><p>Rio swallowed quickly and hid her face in her hands before Agatha reached out to remove them and held Rio’s face instead. “Thank you for… he feels safe with you. I know you make him feel safe.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, only sniffed softly and turned her head into Agatha’s palm, placing a kiss there when she shouldn’t have.</p><p>A noise told them that Nicky had arrived back but neither pulled away in time and a confused Nicky padded over, looking between his mom and Rio with a deep frown on his face, “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing, mellizo.”</p><p>“Mama?”</p><p>“Nothing, honey. Rio was just upset that you were upset.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and Nicky continued to frown, “Maybe… maybe we can play more after lunch? Just two mellizos.”</p><p>“She has to work, sweetheart.”</p><p>“With James?”</p><p>Rio shot a glance at Agatha and Agatha smiled softly and reached to take Rio’s hand, taking Nicky’s in her other. “Yes, honey. But why don’t I take you home and we can-…”</p><p>“No, mama. I want to stay. Can we please stay?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed and nodded and Rio bit down on her lip as she said, “Well, why don’t you hang out with your mom and when I’m done I’ll come say goodbye before we all go home?”</p><p>“No,” Nicky stamped his foot a little, his brow furrowing even more, “No I want to stay with you. I won’t see you again for- for-…” his brown eyes filled with tears once more and Agatha dropped Rio’s hand to pull her son to her again.</p><p>“Honey. You’ll see Rio again.”</p><p>“No she always says she’ll come over a-and she d-doesn’t.”</p><p>“Nicky.”</p><p>“J-James sees y-you m-more.”</p><p>The floodgates opened again and Rio didn’t know how to respond. But Agatha did. Agatha settled down more on the floor and as she held Nick with one arm she reached for Rio with her other. Rio hesitated even as she was tugged closer and for a little while didn’t know where to sit but she settled by Agatha’s hip and sat with her legs at ninety degrees so Agatha was against her back one and Rio could reach for her opposite hip.</p><p>Nicky sniffed and turned to look at her, his frown gone this time, his expression helpless. Rio shuffled closer until she just bent her knees up and wrapped her arms around the two of them. It was a little awkward but it was worth it.</p><p>“I promise I’ll come see you more. I want to. If you’ll let me?”</p><p>She found that in her attempts to rub Nicky’s back she was simultaneously rubbing Agatha’s now but she couldn’t stop herself, wouldn’t have stopped for the world.</p><p>“Okay, mellizo.”</p><p>Nicky was quiet, quieter than he had been all day and Rio frowned because of it, felt sick because of it. She moved her hand up to brush the hair from his head again and said with an equally soft voice, “Why don’t you come watch me work this afternoon? Your mama can sit with you and you can see how… how with James it’s just pretend.”</p><p>“It’s not pretend with me?”</p><p>“No, mi ángel, it’s not pretend with you.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and flung his arms around Rio’s neck and she laughed in surprise and heaved them both over backwards and held Nicky firmly to her as he giggled.</p><p>“You’re silly,” he accused and Rio knew he was going to be okay when he did. She hummed happily and placed a kiss to the top of his head just as Agatha moved to sit beside them and looked down. Somewhere her hand brushed Nicky’s back and found Rio’s on the way and they linked fingers over the little boy.</p><p>Something was swirling in Agatha’s eyes that made Rio tug at her gently, made her motion with her head, and Agatha took the hint, she climbed over them both and lay carefully down so Rio could lift her arm and Agatha could rest her head against her shoulder.</p><p>They knew how to hold each other.</p><p>Even from the beginning.</p><p>Rio’s body just knew where to be for Agatha’s.</p><p>There was stillness for a second, and then, Nicky scrambled to get a look at his mom and Rio was reminded of the time they’d been in this exact position on Agatha’s couch. Only this time Agatha’s hand rested demurely over Rio’s top, she wasn’t tracing soft patterns over her bare abdomen, she wasn’t nuzzling into her neck.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and felt the weight of the two over her for a while, Nicky’s hand had found her hair and he was righting the wrongs of James’ fingers through it from earlier, and Agatha had reached up to turn her face gently, to force her to look at her, and when she did she mouthed: “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and Agatha shifted up as her fingers continued to dance song Rio’s jaw. And as she watched Agatha’s eyes dilate and move about her face, she forgot the horror of the last few days.</p><p>All that mattered was Agatha was here in her arms again.</p><p>And Nicky was too.</p><p>Agatha moved again. She skirted up to lean over Rio properly, using her hand on the floor as a ballast as her other continued its soft exploration of her jaw. Rio turned her head to watch the movement and stared up at her silently, desperately.</p><p>“I think if you were married to mama not in pretend she might be happier.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes at Nicky’s soft words, felt Agatha’s touch stop, then move down her throat until her hand simply rested against her clavicle.</p><p>She wondered if she could feel the insistence of her heartbeat.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said quietly, “why do you say that?”</p><p>“You never smile with daddy. And daddy never cuddles us. Mommies and daddies should cuddle.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and forced herself to open her eyes and looked up at Agatha who was now clutching her collar. She looked pale again, her whole face suddenly tight.</p><p>“Nicky, honey… it’s more complicated than that.”</p><p>Agatha gaze darted across and met Rio’s and Rio sucked in a breath at the intensity of it, at the desperation in her blue eyes. She swallowed and cautiously said to Nicky as she stared up at his mother, “Nicky I’ll always be around to play ball or for cuddles or…”</p><p>But she stopped herself because Agatha had looked away.</p><p>And she didn’t want her to.</p><p>She reached up even as everything was screaming at her not to and her hand found purchase on the back of Agatha’s head. She made her turn, and pulled her until Agatha’s elbow gave in and she was laying back against her.</p><p>Agatha’s cheek was against her shoulder, her fingers now curling around the collar of her shirt for just a second until she brought it down.</p><p>This time her hand did find the warm skin of her stomach and Rio’s closed her eyes as she felt the two settle into her again, settle closer. Two of Agatha’s fingers had slipped below her shirt, resting their warmth over hungry skin.</p><p>It was the most intimate thing that had ever happened to Rio. It was secret, had to be, because Nicky was so close. And Agatha’s touches, always private, always a secret, even when they were alone, always carried shadow with them.</p><p>But this touch, this touch was secret, but instead of feeling like shadow, it felt like safety.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a heavy breath and Rio shivered for its brush over her skin.</p><p>But the reaction, the reaction hadn’t been what she’d expected, or what she wanted. Agatha had stiffened and paled rather than said something even remotely like: “yes I want that too!”</p><p>Though maybe she couldn’t. Ralph was still Nicky’s dad. He was still his dad. He was still his dad. He was still his dad. He was still his dad. He was still her husband.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked, her body twitched in shock, and she stared up at Agatha who was now above her again, having moved whilst Rio was spiralling.</p><p>“Lunch? What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers were swirling, moving back and forth and round and round and god Rio couldn’t think.</p><p>“Want?”</p><p>“To eat, honey?”</p><p>Rio frowned and Nicky patted her head, “Are you sleepy?”</p><p>“I…” Agatha pulled her hand away and Rio’s brain stumbled over itself. “A little, kid.”</p><p>She caught Agatha’s eye and in looking, they exchanged more than words could ever say.</p><p>Agatha pulled back fully after only a few seconds. Rio watched as she turned to Nicky and asked him to run across to Rio’s trailer and knock for Jen. She remained still as the little boy did as he was told. She sucked in a breath as the trailer door closed and Agatha, with patient hands, encouraged her to sit up.</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to… he’s not been himself. I've not been able to hide... I....”</p><p>Rio looked down at the hand now in her own, at the space where yesterday Agatha’s new ring had been.</p><p>“Don’t apologise.”</p><p>“No, I need to. This morning must have been… Rio he loves you so much. You’re his hero and he wants…”</p><p>Rio swallowed, filling in the gap where Agatha had stopped herself: <em>a family</em>.</p><p>“Ralph doesn’t play? Doesn’t cuddle him or-…?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, a reluctant acknowledgement.</p><p>“I’m sorry I walked away.”</p><p>“You turned back, that’s what matters.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly and closed her eyes, Agatha’s hold on her hand dropped as she did and instead she felt her hand on her cheek, her lips against her other one and Agatha whispered, “Tomorrow, I want to tell you everything. Not just… not just what happened that night, okay?”</p><p>Rio looked back to her, pulled away an inch or two to be able to see the fear in such soft blue eyes and she nodded as the door opened again and Nicky, followed by Jen and Alice arrived inside.</p><p>“What’s up? I’m being ordered around by a kid now?”</p><p>“Not ordered,” Nicky muttered quietly as he made his way back over to Agatha who was now standing and pulling Rio up with her.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat when she was back on two feet and absently brushed down her thighs just for something to do.</p><p>“Lunch?” Alice asked hopefully, “We have maybe thirty minutes before call time.”</p><p>“Actually,” Rio said as she cleared her throat and now ran her fingers through her wild hair - Brett would die if he saw how messy it currently was due, mostly, to James’ sticky fingers and Nicky’s gentle twisting. “I need to do something.”</p><p>“What? No, Rio,” Nicky said from where he stood in front of Agatha, “I want to have lunch with you.”</p><p>“I know, kid, but… I promise, you’ll see me in a few minutes and it’ll be worth it, okay?”</p><p>Nicky frowned a little but nodded and Rio kissed his temple quickly before ushering Alice out the trailer and shooting Agatha what she hoped would be a reassuring smile.</p><p>Outside she gasped in a breath and Alice looked to her in alarm.</p><p>“When did the kid arrive? And why does he look more and more like you every time I see him?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, now tugging Alice away from the trailer and in the direction of the costume department.</p><p>“Shh. I just need… need some distance… fuck me.”</p><p>“What happened? Rio, what’s…?”</p><p>“I had to take James too and Nicky… he <em>lost</em> it. I’ve never seen him lose it before. He’s been crying like… all morning and…”</p><p>She cleared her throat and only dropped her tight hold on Alice’s sleeve when a member of the crew walked past them and she realised she must look insane dragging her manager along like that.</p><p>“He got so mad at James. He was calling me fucking mama all morning and Nicky just…”</p><p>“Holy shit. I mean… no prizes for guessing <em>why</em> he lost it.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“Agatha’s not the only jealous one in that family.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Alice sighed and grabbed Rio to make her stop. “Look, the kid loves you. He’s young. He doesn’t understand. He wants you around because you’re fun and give him attention and, let’s face it, Ralph’s a shit.”</p><p>“A <em>cunt</em>,” Rio corrected.</p><p>“Right. A cunt. Anyone can see you’d be a better parent than Ralph. Agatha knows it and Nicky clearly does too. But… babe, don’t let that blur your vision. You can’t be fooled into forgiving her because her son loves you.”</p><p>Rio sighed and ran the fingers of both hands through her hair, taking just a second to let that notion sink in.</p><p>“We’re talking tomorrow. That’s a… that’s a tomorrow issue. Right now I just want to make sure he knows he’s… he knows I’m here for him.”</p><p>“Right,” Alice said slowly, eyeing her friend up suspiciously and clearing her throat, “and how are you going to do that?”</p><p>Rio turned and motioned to Trailer B that belonged to the Costume Department and Alice raised her brows, “Getting him a ring too?”</p><p>“Shut up. There was a sweater that matches mine in there. It’s green. James wouldn’t wear it. Nicky would like it.”</p><p>She marched off before Alice could say anything else and within two minutes Stevie had enthusiastically greeted them both and was rummaging in the back for the sweater, having promised it would be large enough to fit Nicky and Rio could have it.</p><p>Rio looked around the space, trying to think of anything else she could do to make the afternoon a safe space for Nicky, knowing he’d have to face up to James being there again. She poked around in drawers and fished in the little pots of off-cuts and various costume paraphernalia around the sides and then she made a choice that didn’t even feel like a choice, it was so naturally made.</p><p>She found a piece of white card and grabbed a sharpie from the side and wrote in large letters ‘NICKY’ and underneath in slightly smaller ones ‘mellizo’.</p><p>“What’s that for?”</p><p>“A name for the back of his chair. He can have mine.”</p><p>“You’ve never given <em>me</em> a name for the back of your chair.”</p><p>Rio ignored Alice as she grabbed a pair of scissors the card to size. “<em>You</em> are not a cute little boy. <em>You</em> are a pain in the ass.”</p><p>“That’s it! I’m moving out!”</p><p>Rio laughed as she held up the final product and waved it in Alice’s face. “Yeah right. Then you’d actually have to sort out your shit and confess to Jen that you’re the messiest person alive.”</p><p>“She’d love me anyway,” Alice huffed as she tried to snatch the card still waving near her face.</p><p>Rio snatched it back.</p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>Rio grabbed a glitter stick from the side as Alice hovered over her shoulder. “You should let me write it. Or get one of the-…”</p><p>“Stevie?”</p><p>Rio looked up and Stevie turned around, “Could you write Nicky’s name on the back of here, please? Gonna just assume you have better writing than me.”</p><p>Stevie laughed as Rio showed her what she’d already done and then did as she was asked, “Voila!”</p><p>Rio grinned and admired her handiwork. “God I’m glad you fixed it.”</p><p>Rio hurried then, grabbing the sweater and placing a quick kiss to Stevie’s grateful cheek, and rushing over to the sound stage to finish her little project. She attached Nicky’s name to the back of her own seat and gently folded the sweater in the centre of it. It wasn't much, but it was something.</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio looked over and saw Alice very obviously thrusting her head in the direction of Agatha and Nicky now walking onto set through the large studio doors.</p><p>Nicky was pressed as close as he could be to his mama’s side and looked serious about the whole thing until he spotted Rio and he released Agatha’s hand to run to her. He smashed into her and Rio laughed as he did, taking the smack to her stomach with the pride of a woman who had a little boy who loved her.</p><p>She ducked down to hug him back and whispered in his ear, “Only special people get to be on set when we’re rehearsing, you know.”</p><p>As Nicky pulled back to grin up at her Rio grinned right back, and was blinded for a second by his likeness. But a hand on her arm made her look up and Agatha was there, and Rio was truly blinded.</p><p>Agatha was framed by one of the large studio lights and looked ethereal in the glow. As Rio raised herself to stand again she felt that same dizzy way as before, but this time it wasn’t panic.</p><p>“Where did you go?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little as Nicky moved back closer to Agatha as people around them began to move and the set became busier suddenly, Rio motioned to her seat, which she’d dragged over to be next to Agatha’s.</p><p>“Well, I wanted Nicky to have his own seat and there was a green sweater the right size in the costume department that matches one of <em>my</em> sweaters so I thought that maybe Nicky would like to have that.”</p><p>As Alice moved over and held up the sweater for Nicky to admire, Rio turned to see Agatha’s reaction and bit her lip when she saw her eyes cloud over and her gaze become hooded and heavy.</p><p>“I don’t deserve it.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath, and answered the only way she could: “Nicky does.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and they both turned to Nicky. Rio’s chest ached but as Nicky turned around to her, now perched in the high-top director’s chair clutching his new sweater, the ache in her chest dulled.</p><p>Pain could wait.</p><p>She knew she’d feel more than enough of it tomorrow.</p><p>“Like it?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio grinned and had just enough time to give Nicky a quick hug and receive a soft “thank you” from the boy before a PA ran over and she was ushered over to set. Waiting for her was James, Maria, and a couple of the crew ready to jump in where needed as they rehearsed the scene.</p><p>Initially, Rio kept her attention on James, occasionally having to dip out of character to ask him to not call her "mama Rio" and instead just "mama", and to focus on the few lines he had.</p><p>She’d worked with child actors before and most were either scarily well-behaved, or just kids who reacted naturally to what was said to them or what was in the scene. All were usually challenging in their own ways, but none as challenging as James.</p><p>He was still full of energy, still keen to refer to her as “mama Rio!” instead of just “mama”. He still wanted to bounce about instead of simply walking from mark to mark but eventually, with a lot of cajoling and breaks in between rehearsing, he calmed down.</p><p>And the little terror that was James turned out to be a pretty good actor.</p><p>He had large brown eyes and an expressive face and when Rio talked to him he looked at her like she’d put the stars in the sky.</p><p>But it took a while to get to that. It took a lot of Maria and Rio both trying their hardest until they could get anything remotely useful out of him by way of rehearsing or acting.</p><p>And Rio just kept thinking about the little boy watching them next to his mother and how much easier all this might be is she were working with Nicky now instead of the little boy with the mile-a-minute attitude.</p><p>She never looked around to see how Nicky was feeling about it all, never wanted to check in on Agatha’s feelings either. It would be too hard to concentrate if she knew either were struggling for whatever reason.</p><p>But when, after over two hours, it was declared that they were done and James <em>jumped</em> into her arms to celebrate, Rio made the mistake of turning to look over.</p><p>At some point Nicky must have moved into his mom’s lap because now Alice was in her seat. Agatha was whispering something in Nicky’s ear and Nicky was frowning down at the floor, toying with the green sweater he’d just received in his hands.</p><p>Rio turned back, placed James down, watched him run off to his <em>actual</em> mama and then focused in on Maria who had some thoughts on the scene.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she returned to the little group at the edges of the set waiting for her and plastered a grin on her face as she did.</p><p>“Are we ready to go?”</p><p>“We sure are,” Alice said with raised brows at Rio, trying to communicate something that Rio couldn’t quite grasp.</p><p>Nicky slid from Agatha’s lap and cleared his throat quietly and Rio watched as he waited for Agatha and wouldn’t look up at her.</p><p>“It’s just pretend, mellizo.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, unused to being shut out by the boy with the big brown eyes.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze and smiled a little but Rio couldn’t bring herself to smile back anymore so she said to Nicky, “Tell you what, will we go back to the court and have a quick game before we leave?”</p><p>Nicky <em>did</em> look up then and Rio saw that he looked hopeful suddenly and she felt her shoulders relax. “Can we?”</p><p>“Of course! If it’s okay with your mom.”</p><p>“Who am I to stop the two best basketball players play basketball?”</p><p>Rio smiled and Nicky’s hopeful expression turned into a grin, which softened only when he spotted Maria marching towards them and he shrunk back a little towards Agatha.</p><p>“Agatha? Can we borrow you? I need to get some more set ups sorted for your seen with Quill.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but huffed her ascent and ducked down quickly to kiss Nicky, “Stay with Rio, okay?”</p><p>“Yes, mama. Stay with Rio.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s arm as she walked past and Rio inhaled her perfume as she did. A little hand found hers almost the second Agatha had stepped away and Rio smiled as she turned to Alice and Jen who were looking at her expectantly, “Can you take Nicky’s sweater? We’ll be an hour or so then we’ll come back.”</p><p>“Make it two?”</p><p>Rio had to try not to laugh at the expression on Alice’s face as she nudged Jen’s side but she nodded and hid her smile as best she could. “Two it is.”</p><p>They left the set as a foursome then peeled off so Rio and Nicky could go back to the court and find the ball they’d left there and Jen and Alice could make the most of some time alone in Rio’s trailer.</p><p>Nicky relaxed the further and further they got away from the set and by the time they were on the court he was running around like he might if they were on his home court, safe and secure in the knowledge that he had Rio’s undivided attention.</p><p>“He shoots!” Rio shouted, “He scores!”</p><p>She mimicked the noise of the crowd as best she could and ran around in circles as Nicky cheered and charged for the ball.</p><p>The two mellizos both relaxed fully in the rush of playing their favourite game with their favourite person. They bounced well off of one another and celebrated even the misses until they were both sweaty, flushed, and beaming.</p><p>Rio had the ball now, hamming it up a little. She dived and dodged around Nicky and then, it happened.</p><p>It happened so fast.</p><p>Rio bounced the ball, forgetting for a second where she was and who she was playing with and it flew through the air until it hit the wall not far behind the standalone hoop and came flying right back.</p><p>Nicky jumped for it and time slowed down.</p><p>He’d thrown himself upwards, managed to wrap his arms around the ball, and as he came down he came down at an angle, falling back to earth again with his feet thrown out before him.</p><p>Rio dived.</p><p>She caught him.</p><p>The pain was instantaneous, but she had Nicky in her arms.</p><p>She yelled out at some point, but either his name or through pain, she wasn’t sure. But something else had happened too.</p><p>As Nicky had slipped on his way to the ball, so had the ball from his hands. The momentum of it had carried it straight from his grasp and hurtling towards one of the big, expensive, studio lights.</p><p>The crash was sickening, the damage, irrevocable.</p><p>But Rio had Nicky. She’d caught him before he’d smacked his head on the hard concrete and so a little bit of smashed glass and a grazed knee was nothing to her.</p><p>“¿Estás bien, mellizo?”</p><p>Rio was panting, from fear as well as exertion, and helped Nicky to right himself before she flopped back onto her ass on the ground to inspect her knee. It looked angry, and worse than it now felt, but she’d ruined her leggings and huffed quietly to herself.</p><p>“I’ll fetch mama,” Nicky said seriously as he looked between the glass on the ground and Rio’s injured knee, his cheeks flushed a deep crimson.</p><p>“No, baby. I’m fine. Are you okay?”</p><p>As she pushed herself up to stand she heard voices behind them and saw Nicky’s eyes go wide and his red face pale slightly. She turned and he pressed himself into her side, his arms immediately locking around her as two members of the crew rocked up to see what had happened.</p><p>“Ahhhh, Jesus Christ!”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and delicately peeled Nicky’s hands away from her so she could move forward towards the first of the men. Nicky hovered close by still.</p><p>“My bad. We were playing and-…”</p><p>“Shit, a movie star comes in with her kid and fucks shit up for the rest of us. Do you know how much these things cost?”</p><p>Rio bristled, and maybe it was that the guy had just insulted her, or maybe it was that Nicky was close but she felt incredibly defensive suddenly, but either way she snapped back: “Well shit let me get my calculator out.”</p><p>“Listen, lady, I don’t care how famous you are, you can’t go round-…!”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>The man blinked and so did Rio and they both looked down at Nicky, still clinging onto her side but scowling, “It was an accident! Do not shout at her!”</p><p>“Jesus H fucking Christ. You think this is shouting kid? You think this is-…?!”</p><p>“Hey!” It was Rio’s turn again and this time she stepped in front of Nicky, holding him behind her back, “Watch your fucking mouth when you speak to my kid, okay? Now point me in the direction of your supervisor and I’ll sort this out, you arrogant, condescending piece of-…” Nicky grabbing the back of her shirt made her stop just before she spat the word “pig” at him but he’d got the picture.</p><p>He squared his shoulders and raised his chin and stared her down for a few seconds but when Rio didn’t give he nodded his head in the direction of the studio building. “He has an office in there. Third door on the right. Harvey Kent.”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly, eyed him for a second longer before she turned around and ushered Nicky off before her, muttering under her breath about sexist pigs and their fucking stupid faces.</p><p>“He was mean,” Nicky said with a deep frown and his hand now clutching Rio’s. “He was mean to you and me and I’m telling mama and she will be so mad.”</p><p>Rio smiled tightly and just as she’d pushed the door open to the studio building she spotted a PA nearby and shouted him over. “Could you grab Agatha? Bring her to Harvey Kent’s office? Urgently?”</p><p>The young man nodded and Rio smiled as best she could before she turned to walk with Nicky to the third door on the right. She knocked and wriggled Nicky’s hand to try and get a smile out of him but he was too serious for that, too ready for his mama to come and stand up for the both of them.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat as she opened the door and stepped into a small office, clearly a makeshift one for the purposes of being close to the set. Harvey Kent, in a blue suit and thick glasses, sat behind a busy desk and looked incredibly pissed off already.</p><p>“Harvey? I’m Rio Vi-…”</p><p>“Vidal, yes. You the kid who’s playing her son?”</p><p>Nicky just frowned and shook his head so Rio answered for him, “This is Nicky Harkness.”</p><p>“Agatha’s?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Harvey nodded thoughtfully and stared at Nicky for longer than Rio liked. “Anyway, we’re here because there’s been an accident. One of the lights got smashed and-…”</p><p>“Which?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Which light?”</p><p>“Umm, the big one. One of the big ones, just outside the,” she gestured vaguely behind her in the direction they’d just come from.</p><p>“Smashed?”</p><p>“On accident.”</p><p>“Let me guess, by Harkness’s kid?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said a little more firmly now, “by me.”</p><p>“Melliza,” Nicky whispered, tugging at Rio’s hand, but she ignored him.</p><p>“I’ve come here as a courtesy more than anything. And one of your workers was incredibly-…”</p><p>“Will you sit?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and looked around at a small couch by the wall.</p><p>“Why would I sit?”</p><p>“So I can make a phone call and you can be here for when I’m done.”</p><p>“I don’t take orders.”</p><p>“That’s why I asked.”</p><p>Rio frowned deeply, weighing up her options here. She didn’t know how big of a deal smashing one of those lights really was and she’d already slipped through the net when she’d smacked Quill so maybe…</p><p>“Sit, please.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and motioned for Nicky to go ahead and take a seat. She sat down next to him and squeezed his hand gently, trying to give as much reassurance as she could. Harvey picked up the phone and eyed Nicky for a while which made Rio lean over him slightly, blocking him from view.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Nicky remained silent but frowned and nodded slowly, both his hands now toying with Rio’s fingers. “Your mom will be on her way, okay? We’ll sort it all out.”</p><p>It felt like being called to the principal’s office - something that had happened with relative frequency in Rio’s youth. As the producer spoke purposefully and aggressively into his phone Rio squeezed Nicky’s hand and kept close, assuming (rightfully) that the principal’s office feeling was a new one for him.</p><p>“It’s okay, you’re not in any trouble.”</p><p>Nicky only nodded, only looked at her with those big brown eyes and squeezed her hand right back.</p><p>“So,” the producer interrupted and turned back to the twins in the couch. “We’re not exactly insured for activities other than specifically filming related-…”</p><p>The door opened suddenly and Rio didn’t have to look to know the only person who wouldn’t bother knocking on an executive producer’s office door.</p><p>Agatha had let herself in, wearing a Christmas sweater and sporting her new ring on her finger. She made eye contact with Rio, looked down to her grazed knee, and then looked at the little boy squashed into her side.</p><p>“What the fuck is happening?”</p><p>“Oh, Agatha.” Rio always found it fascinating how people reacted to Agatha versus how they reacted to <em>her</em>. Harvey hadn’t stood when she walked in the room, but he certainly was standing for Agatha right now. He hadn’t even looked slightly nervous when Rio had arrived, but he looked nervous now.</p><p>“Why do you have my son and my wife sat here like they’ve done something wrong?”</p><p>The word ‘wife’ hit harder than a basketball to a glass screen. Nicky had moved a little closer and Rio glanced at him to see if he were reacting to the designation but he seemed simply focused on remaining close, his wide eyes now on his mom.</p><p>“They smashed a light. We simply wanted-…”</p><p>“And who is ‘we’? You’re insured up to your eyeballs. And even if you’re not, that’s your own fault.”</p><p>Agatha turned her attention back to the two on the couch and Rio saw the stress working its way to her jaw. “What happened?”</p><p>“Mama I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>“I threw the ball too hard and Nicky tried to catch it but he slipped and it went in the wrong direction.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, “An accident.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Yes, mama.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped briefly to Rio’s knee again before she turned back to Harvey. “Never haul my son into your office again. Under no circumstances, you hear me?”</p><p>Rio adjusted then, unconsciously transferring Nicky’s hand to her other so she could wrap the arm closest to him around him. Agatha was leaning over the desk now, knuckles white as they held her weight and the force of her anger.</p><p>And Rio chewed on her lip, trying to focus on the worried little boy beside her rather than the overwhelm that came from knowing Agatha had designated her her wife in her brain and was wearing her ring.</p><p>“The insurance,” Harvey began, “it won’t cover activities outside of the filming day.”</p><p>“So dock it from my pay.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said quickly, shifting forwards so that Nicky panicked and reached for her, meaning shifting, but not moving away, was all she could do. “<em>My</em> pay.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said sternly, but not looking at Rio. “Take it from mine. And be thankful I’m not escalating this to Stark.”</p><p>Rio bit too hard on her cheek and twitched as the sharpness trickled through the pain receptors in her mouth. But Agatha was moving now, keeping her eyes on Harvey until the last second when she was straight again, turning to the two of them and holding her hand out.</p><p>Nicky didn’t hesitate to hurry to her but he kept his hold on Rio and tugged her to her feet too.</p><p>As Nicky took his mom’s hand and Rio now stood the other side of him they made eye contact. Agatha’s fury had died somewhere between turning from Harvey and Nicky’s hand reaching her own.</p><p>But her expression was unreadable.</p><p>Behind them as they left the little office Harvey was already back on the phone and to Rio’s delight he sounded a lot less sure than he had done before Agatha had arrived.</p><p>“You hurt your knee,” Agatha observed as they made their way back onto the lot.</p><p>“Rio caught me,” Nicky offered by way of explanation. “I fell on accident but she caught me before I hit the ground.”</p><p>Rio shot Nicky a smile as he grinned up at her and felt Agatha watching her too but she didn’t look around to check. “Can’t let the best basketball player I know get injured, can we?”</p><p>“Silly,” Nicky confirmed as his step became a little peppier and he visibly relaxed as they walked as a trio to Agatha’s trailer.</p><p>Rio released Nicky’s hand when they got to the door and was just about to make her excuses when Agatha said: “Did you clean it?”</p><p>“Clean-…?”</p><p>“No, mama. We had to go sit with that mean man first.”</p><p>Rio smiled and ruffled Nicky’s hair as Agatha motioned with her head to the door, “I’ll help you clean it.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t an idiot. She knew following Agatha and Nicky into Agatha’s trailer was a bad idea, <em>no</em>, a <em>terrible</em> idea, but she followed anyway, as idiots tend to.</p><p>Nicky pulled her to sit down on the couch that was visibly more expensive than her own.</p><p>Agatha had disappeared into the little bathroom and Rio squeezed Nicky’s hand. “You doing okay?”</p><p>“I’m okay. Are you?”</p><p>Agatha emerged carrying a small first aid kit and Rio watched her as she took a seat in the coffee table before her. “Todo bien, mellizo.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha began to silently rifle through the little pack and tilted her head as Nicky shuffled to his knees beside her and whispered too loudly against her ear, “If it hurts you can hold my hand.”</p><p>Agatha in front of her smiled to herself and Rio grinned as she turned to Nicky and was almost nose to nose with him, “I would like that.”</p><p>Nicky grinned right back and settled back down again and Rio this time tucked him under her arm as Agatha shuffled forwards and took hold of Rio’s calf to bend it forwards.</p><p>It felt strangely intimate, even with Nicky beside her. But Agatha didn’t look up and remained focused on the task at hand, which helped Rio somewhat with her racing heart.</p><p>Agatha snipped the already torn fabric of her leggings and Rio bit her lip as with a gentle touch she peeled the fabric back properly to expose her knee fully.</p><p>“Is it sore?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up as she spoke, her hands now back on Rio, her thumbs framing the graze.</p><p>“It’s just grazed, Agatha. It’s fine.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha said gently, turning her attention away from Rio to look at her son. “Rio is trying to be corajuda,” she smiled a little when from the corner of her eye she saw Rio frown, “but this will hurt her okay so hold her hand real tight for me, honey.”</p><p>Nicky, who up until this point had been quite content in Rio’s hold, watching his mama, now looked serious, and tightened his hold on Rio’s hand to make sure she knew he was there.</p><p>“It won’t be that bad,” Rio accused with that same frown, knowing full well that the pain she’d been in these past few days meant that she could handle anything.</p><p>Just apparently not antiseptic wipes.</p><p>“Motherfu-…!”</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>Rio grit her teeth and looked at Nicky who had scrambled up to look at her, his hand stolen from her own to place on her cheek in the aftermath. “It’s okay. Mama will kiss it better. Won’t you, mama?”</p><p>Nicky turned with his hand still on Rio’s cheek and Rio looked too to see Agatha watching them, her hands still cradling the sides of Rio’s knee. Rio could feel Agatha’s fingers twitch a little and she bit down on her lip as she witnessed something she wasn’t expecting.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows at her.</p><p>She was asking permission.</p><p>And the bouncing boy beside her meant she couldn’t say no. So she nodded, just once, and Agatha hesitated for a second before she pressed a firm kiss just above where the graze was.</p><p>Rio had thought that maybe she’d fake it or she’d ghost her lips over her skin but Agatha had done the opposite. She pressed her whole face against Rio’s thigh, making sure she felt her, and whatever magical properties her kiss might have would work double time with the fierceness of her kiss.</p><p>“Better?” Nicky asked proudly, clearly not doubting for a second the healing nature of his mother’s lips.</p><p>Rio shot him a slightly bewildered smile, “Better.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were still warm as they framed her knee and she looked back down to her and noticed the flush on her cheeks. “I won’t put a bandaid on because it’ll need to breathe but before bed tonight you should-…”</p><p>“I know how to take care of a-…”</p><p>“Stay with us tonight! We can help!”</p><p>Rio looked back to Nicky and smiled softly as he settled carefully back into her side, his large eyes focused on his mom.</p><p>“Baby, Rio has her own home.”</p><p>“She can have ours too.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip and watched Agatha as she cleared her throat and began to pack the little first aid kit away.</p><p>“Has James been?”</p><p>“Been where, mellizo?”</p><p>“Your house?”</p><p>Rio shifted back a little to get a better view of Nicky and saw him frowning down at her knee. “No, sweetheart. James has never been to my house.”</p><p>“I’ve only been once. And you weren’t there. But mama said you would be and-…”</p><p>Rio hummed thoughtfully, knowing Nicky was thinking about Christmas. “I was working, Nicky. I would have been there if I could.”</p><p>“It was a surprise, remember?” Agatha added as she zipped back up the pack. “Rio didn’t know we were coming. It was bad luck, honey.”</p><p>Rio watched as Nicky processed this for a while and then she said, “Tell you what, why don’t you come over soon? We can make those tostones my mom taught you how to make? I’m not as good as her but I can make-…”</p><p>“Will James be there?”</p><p>Rio actually laughed, because it was just so absurd to her that Nicky would even worry about… and then it clicked why she was actually laughing. He was Agatha’s son. He was jealous just like his mom. Alice had been right. He was jealous of anyone else laying a claim to her and… and that was hilarious.</p><p>But Nicky’s little face suddenly became tight and he scowled up at her, wrestling to get away from her and off the couch.</p><p>“No, Nicky! No! I was just-…”</p><p>She’d laughed because this <em>mellizo</em>, this twin of hers, was suddenly Agatha’s twin. He was jealous and angry about something he had no need to be worried over.</p><p>The irony, of course, being the only one in the room who had yet to lose it over jealously, at least properly, when she had every right to given what Agatha had done to her with Ralph, was Rio.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha said softly as Nicky stomped his foot and his hands formed fists at his sides.</p><p>“Do not laugh at me!”</p><p>Rio shifted to the edge of her seat and held out both hands to Nicky, her laughter now stopped as she smiled hopefully at the little boy. “I'm sorry, Nicky. It's just... You are so like your mama.”</p><p>Nicky blinked, confusion taking over for a second which meant he relaxed a little and was able to quickly rub at his eye. “How?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, kept her hands out to Nicky, now more of a surrender than a reaching out. “Well,” she could feel Agatha’s eyes on her, knew she had to tread carefully. How could you tell an impressionable little boy that his mother also didn’t like to share? “Your mama is very passionate too. Apasionada, sí?”</p><p>Nicky nodded slowly, now looking down at Rio’s fingers as she wriggled them, “And that’s good. You should be.”</p><p>Nicky nodded again and sniffed as he buried a fist against his eye again, “I don’t want you to play with James.”</p><p>“How about this,” Rio offered cautiously, “Every week, we can schedule in some mellizos time, okay? Just me and you. And maybe your mama if she wants to learn how to really be a baller.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and Nicky’s lips twitched just a little and Rio knew then that she’d cracked him.</p><p>“She isn’t very good.”</p><p>Agatha gasped dramatically and Nicky’s tentative smile grew up his face as Agatha dived at him and began to tickle his sides. “What did you say about your mama?!”</p><p>Nicky squealed and began to writhe as he tried to bat Agatha away and despite the joy of the moment, despite the fact that both Agatha and Nicky were happy, beaming, in fact, Rio felt hollow suddenly. She felt outside of the bubble more than she ever had.</p><p>Because Nicky wanted her in it, and she wanted that too, but she still had to talk through everything with Agatha. She had to keep a cool head and listen to her tell her everything about why she’d willingly taken her heart and then willingly crushed it.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio jumped a little, having drifted to the most painful part of her mind, but a hand was on her good knee, and she turned to see Agatha looking up at her expectantly, her brown eyed boy looking the same.</p><p>“Come here please,” Agatha echoed the words of her son from earlier, and Rio couldn’t refuse her as she slid down to sit back against the couch.</p><p>It was a pile on then. Nicky hit first and then Agatha. Rio burst out laughing as Nicky giggled into her ear and dug his knee into her stomach. She felt winded, but she felt light, honoured that the two precious people in her arms were the jealous types and that they were jealous for her.</p><p>The pain shifted again, turning to pride once more.</p><p>She squeaked as Nicky’s knee dug in a little more and then barked a laugh when lithe fingers found her side and dug in there too. “No! No! Get off, get off!”</p><p>Nicky laughed more as he pulled away and Rio rolled her eyes as Agatha found a way to tug him into her lap instead, leaving Rio to recover and clutch at her stomach. “¡Matones!” <em>Bullies!</em></p><p>“¿Qué? No entiendo…” Nicky’s giggles died as he whispered the words, shy about his lack of understanding.</p><p>Rio just turned to him with a smile and reached to brush the hair back from his face, “It means “bullies”.”</p><p>Agatha ducked her head down to kiss Nicky’s shoulder and then murmured something in his ear that Rio missed but that made him grin. Rio leant back more against the couch and tilted her head in question at the two of them, “What?”</p><p>“Mama says I shouldn’t learn Spanish from you because you’re not very good.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped and she turned to glare at Agatha, “Oh? Is that right?”</p><p>She just shrugged and smirked against Nicky’s shoulder.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and Rio clicked her tongue, “No tostones for your mama, Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha gasped and Rio knew she was playing up to it as Nicky wriggled happily in her arms. When their eyes met Rio couldn’t help but grin at her, for the mother she was, and how it made her chest ache and the rest of her feel things inexpressible around a little boy.</p><p>“One tostone,” Agatha pouted, making sure Rio could see it as she rested her chin on Nicky’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio hummed, drawn to that soft lower lip that she’d bitten and tasted more times than she could count but never enough times to satisfy the need she felt now. “No.”</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>Rio laughed as she raised her gaze up a few inches to meet Agatha’s eyes and saw in them a glint of something she’d missed in the week and a half they’d been in this strange limbo together. They were teasing, sure, but there was something else there, something else that if Nicky weren’t currently between them, Rio would have liked to have explored.</p><p>Agatha’s hand shot out and she was careful to touch the skin of Rio’s injured knee, but skirting around the graze and Rio knew instantly that Agatha had realised what Rio was thinking. She knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Rio swallowed and fought the blush that threatened to grace her cheeks as Agatha’s finger began to circle the graze.</p><p>“No. No tostones for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched a little and she stopped pouting but Rio had torn her gaze away from the danger zone anyway and Agatha had pulled her hand back, tucking it around Nicky instead.</p><p>“I’ll get my tostones,” Agatha said softly, more of a promise than a whisper and Rio decided the next batch she made - inevitably burnt or soggy as they would be - she’d gift them all to Agatha.</p><p>A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts as she was deciding what else she’d like to gift to Agatha and they all looked round when both Jen and Alice stepped inside.</p><p>“So, you’ll never guess who just got a furious call from Harvey Kent.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and turned to lean back properly against the couch, “Surely not <em>you</em>, Alice?!”</p><p>“Hah fucking hah.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and rubbed at her face as she felt Nicky reach to pat her shoulder. “It was an accident.”</p><p>“Well who the fuck plays fucking basketball-…?”</p><p>“Do you mind speaking like that in front of my <em>son</em>, <em>Alice</em>?”</p><p>Alice blanched and Rio smiled a little at the sight of it, pleased she was no longer being chastised.</p><p>“Fine. I’m just saying it was-…”</p><p>“It was an accident, Alice. What’s he worried about?”</p><p>“Apparently insurance or some such shit - sorry, Agatha - but I just said-…”</p><p>“She said he should go fuck himself-…” Jen added before Agatha made a noise of objection and dramatically clamped her hands over Nicky’s ears.</p><p>“Oh, he’s heard worse from <em>you</em> lately.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and in turning to see Agatha’s reaction to this she saw Alice blink across at her in shock. Agatha looked briefly mutinous but then schooled her expression and cleared her throat, “thank you for the support, <em>Jennifer</em>.”</p><p>Jennifer rolled her eyes and to try to bring the mood in the room back around Rio said: “I’ll pay it, Alice. If they can’t get the insurance then-…”</p><p>“Absolutely not. Jen, I’ll be paying it.”</p><p>“No,” Rio insisted, shooting Agatha a look, “It was my fault. Take it out of my-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha had reached a hand out to her knee and had turned around to look at her sternly, “Let me pay to get rid of the problem for you.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed, as she recognised Agatha’s go-to move: paying for things to make them go away. But this wasn’t a G-Wagon, and she wasn’t as raw anymore. She watched her for a second and then she turned back to Alice and in a louder voice than before she said, “Alice, call him back. Tell him I’ll pay for it. Go. Now.”</p><p>Alice looked shocked for a second because Rio wasn’t the type of boss to order her about but she nodded and turned and went to do as she’d been told.</p><p>Agatha removed her hand from Rio’s knee and Rio stood up.</p><p>“Rio,” Nicky said quickly, looking up at her with wide eyes, “don’t forget your promise.”</p><p>Rio smiled and ducked back down again to place a quick kiss to Nicky’s warm cheek. “Never, mellizo.”</p><p>Nicky smiled, back to being shy now there was a third adult in the room, and Agatha tightened her hold around him which made Rio look up at her. She looked nervous suddenly, and couldn’t quite meet Rio’s gaze.</p><p>Rio hesitated for a second, heard Jen calling her name, and finally, reluctantly, she pulled away without saying anything. Their cosy, familial bubble had been burst. Rio squeezed Jen’s arms as she walked past and she stepped out into the early evening with her heart, as battered and bruised as it was, sitting curled up on the floor of Agatha’s trailer, by the couch.</p><p>As she marched back with Alice to her own trailer, the pain settled in her chest again with its own mellizo: panic.</p>

<p>7:37pm<br/>
Agatha Harkness: You can come over.</p><p>Rio put her phone down and her head between her knees.</p><p>Maybe being alone wasn’t a great idea. Maybe having Alice with her would have been a better idea. Maybe having a hand to hold or someone to slap her out of it would have been better.</p><p>She thought about calling her dad again. But she’d already spoken to him for an hour that morning.</p><p>She knew he wouldn’t mind, that he was endlessly patient, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it. If she spoke about it she’d cry again. And she had to be together. She had to remain in tact if she were going to get through this.</p><p>She’d been ready for hours now. She’d showered around midday after a particularly intensive workout. She’d then changed into three different outfits until she settled on a long-sleeved black jersey top, and dark jeans.</p><p>It wasn’t flashy, but it was comfortable, and she needed comfort right now. She wanted as much comfort as she could get.</p><p>Her hair was brushed and her face makeup free - she had to be ready to cry after all.</p><p>It wasn’t how she wanted to look for Agatha. She wanted to look so devastatingly gorgeous that she’d combust when she saw her. But perhaps that was a dream from a different day. Now it was about remaining upright, remaining alive.</p><p>Agatha’s text went unanswered in her inbox as Rio drove to her house buried in the most expensive part of town. She parked not too far away but didn’t move for fear she might collapse if she tried.</p><p>This had to go well. And by ‘well’, Rio meant she had to not have a breakdown, she had to not lose it, or lose herself.</p><p>Only when she felt strong enough did she step from the car and make her way down to press the buzzer for the gate. She was let in before she could even take a breath. Perhaps it was a sign that Agatha wanted this over and done with.</p><p>Maybe she wanted Rio in and out faster than you could say: “I slept with my husband, sorry.”</p><p>Rio stepped up the path, feeling heavy with every step she took, feeling sick with every step she took.</p><p>But Agatha was in the doorway, looking pale and standing in a plain white t-shirt and light jeans. It was frustrating that she looked beautiful. That she always looked <em>so</em> beautiful.</p><p>Why did she always look so damn beautiful?</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>Rio stopped before her, momentarily thunderstruck and unable to think of what to say. But Agatha seemed to understand and she took a step back, motioning for Rio to enter through the space she’d just made for her.</p><p>Rio did, silently, barely able to keep upright, let alone anything else.</p><p>She stopped just inside the door, felt the absence of what Agatha’s greeting might have been under different circumstances. A hug, a kiss, any kind of contact.</p><p>Agatha liked contact. She liked to touch her and be close.</p><p>And now they were lightyears apart.</p><p>“I sent Nicky to stay with Jen. I thought that maybe…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t finish what she was about to say but Rio could guess: <em>Maybe I’d shout. Maybe you’d shout. Maybe we’d both shout.</em></p><p>She just kept breathing and followed Agatha through to the kitchen. On the side there sat a lit candle and a bottle of Barolo, already open, already being left to breathe.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat as she approached it and lifted it with the two large glasses.</p><p>“I have anything else if you want something different?”</p><p>Rio still couldn’t speak so she just shook her head just once. Agatha smiled, more of a gesture than a feeling, and turned to the little breakfast nook that Rio had sat at so many times before under vastly different circumstances.</p><p>She let Agatha take her spot first and she sat at the top of the table, at the bottom of the inbuilt L-shaped bench. Rio was still for a while before she slid in to the back part of the bench, making sure there was at least two feet of distance between her and Agatha.</p><p>She stared at the grain of the table and lay her hands out before her.</p><p>Silence filled the room, loud and unbearable, until it was broken by Agatha pouring the wine into the large glasses and the sound of her sliding one over to Rio.</p><p>When she did, Rio saw that her ring was on, that she was wearing a fake engagement ring chosen for a movie role, in her own home.</p><p>It made her heart stutter, momentarily forgetting what it was supposed to be doing, as her chest heaved with the unbearable longing she now felt.</p><p>“You’re wearing your ring,” she couldn’t help but say, the first thing she’d said to Agatha since the trailer the day before.</p><p>“I… I felt like…” Agatha stole her hand back and hid the ring from view, “I just felt like I needed it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look up, didn’t even raise her gaze when Agatha hid her hand. She just kept staring at the table before her, at the hands that had just now decided to start shaking.</p><p>Her whole body was shaking. She couldn’t stop herself. It was incessant, it was embarrassing.</p><p>Whether it was a misfire of adrenaline, the fear that this was it for them, or something else entirely, she didn’t know. She just knew she was shaking and that it made her more mortified than she’d ever been in her life.</p><p>She sat on her hands.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said quietly, and though Rio didn’t look up at her name she tilted her head slightly, a kind of acknowledgement that she could hear her, though she wasn’t able to respond.</p><p>“If you’ll let me, I want to tell you everything. I… I want, I want you to know everything. Everything there is to know about… about me… Is that okay? Do you need anything before I start?”</p><p>Rio knew she only needed one thing.</p><p>Or her body did.</p><p>She lurched up suddenly and scrambled from the bench, blocked by the table before her until she suddenly wasn’t and she could tear through to the bathroom where she slammed the door, was just able to lock it, and into the waiting mouth of the toilet she vomited her guts up.</p><p>It was mostly bile, mostly nothing at all.</p><p>But she wretched and wretched until she could wretch no more.</p><p>Her body collapsed against the bowl when she was done and she breathed heavily, raggedly, and wiped at the tears that had fallen.</p><p>This wasn’t how she wanted this to go.</p><p>She’d been preparing all week for this. She’d been convincing herself all week that she was ready, that she could handle it.</p><p>And suddenly, when faced with it, she’d never felt less prepared in her life.</p><p>She sucked in a slow, steadying breath and eventually dragged herself to her feet. She cleaned up after herself and rummaged until she found some mouthwash and rinsed her mouth with it.</p><p>In the mirror she saw the shadow of the woman she’d once been and she wiped at her tear-stained face, ran her hands through her hair, and then went back out.</p><p>By the table Agatha was standing now, looking panicked and fearful but Rio didn’t meet her gaze as she silently slid back into her seat and raised her glass to knock back the large glass Agatha had poured for her.</p><p>When she was done, Agatha said nothing as she refilled Rio’s glass but Rio didn’t touch it after that.</p><p>Some wine was fine, but she had barely eaten for days now, and she didn’t want to be drunk.</p><p>They were silent for a couple of minutes and out of the corner of her eye Rio could see Agatha toying with her ring. She wanted to reach for her hand to make her stop, to make her hold her instead, but she stopped herself and sat on her hands once more.</p><p>“I’ve known I was gay since I was about eight. Or maybe,” Agatha began in such a soft voice that Rio finally had to look up at her. “Maybe not exactly, but it was around then that… I knew I was different.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, having not realised that when Agatha had said “everything” she meant <em>everything</em>.</p><p>“I had what I know now was a crush on one of the older girls. And then when I was a teenager, I had a crush on a friend. I felt good whenever she looked at me, it felt nice to hold her hand, I…”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and Rio suddenly felt the urge again to reach for her.</p><p>“My mother had been telling me for as long as I remember that… that something was wrong with me, that I had a badness inside, that… that I’d been born evil. So I hid it. I hid it as best I could. I think she knew, I think she knows… I’ve never been sure.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said quietly but Agatha only shook her head again and raised her eyes to meet Rio’s. She looked broken, but she shook her head once more and Rio only nodded, and remained silent.</p><p>Agatha took a sip of her wine and continued.</p><p>“I made sure I was friends with the right people. I blocked anyone who I felt was beneath me. I no longer held any hands or harboured any crushes. I was a straight A student, head cheerleader, top of all my classes. I went to the right college and even went to Juilliard. I had one boyfriend and then I had a husband.”</p><p>Rio looked down again, swallowed the bile that rose in her throat.</p><p>“Throughout all of it I knew I was… I knew I was gay. I just ignored it, pushed it down, wilfully suppressed. And it was working. It was working so beautifully and then…”</p><p>Rio looked up again and saw that Agatha was looking at her now.</p><p>Her eyes were that glassy way they got when they were full of tears she was reluctant to yet shed. She looked hopeless and terrified once more.</p><p>“And then I saw you. And I just… I… I fell in love.”</p><p>Rio had to look away again. She had to close her eyes and take a deep breath because they’d barely started and how the ever-living fuck was she supposed to get through this without having a breakdown?</p><p>“Rio, I… I know how this sounds… I know I sound insane but the moment I saw you on that stage I just… it was like I’d been hit by lightning, or, or, stabbed right through the heart. You left me…. You left me completely and utterly-…”</p><p>“Please,” Rio managed to get out, feeling her now-numb hands fizz back to life as she pulled them from under her thighs and dug her knuckles into her eyes, “please, Agatha this is…”</p><p>“I need to tell you, Rio. You…” She heard a noise and looked down to see Agatha’s hand reaching for her across the table, “Please, please let me explain.”</p><p>Rio released a long, slow breath, allowing herself to shrink down into the back of the bench. Agatha didn’t say anything until Rio nodded and then she slowly pulled her offered hand away and started again in a slow, soft voice: “I just fell so hard and so instantly. And when I cornered you in the bathroom it was the first time I’d ever… I’d ever lost control like that.”</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, transporting herself momentarily to the grimy bathroom in downtown Chicago where they’d first met. She could smell the bleach that still didn’t hide the stink from the drains. She could feel the hard, cold stall door against her back, she could taste Agatha’s warm breath against her lips.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes and blinked across at Agatha, and saw that she looked concerned and her hand was held back out to her again.</p><p>“I need you to know that from the moment I saw you I… I’ve loved you.”</p><p>Rio released a quiet sort of whimper and Agatha leant closer, bit didn’t move from her seat. Rio didn’t take the hand held out to her. It was still so early. They’d barely begun. If she held onto her now, she’d never make it through.</p><p>When Agatha realised Rio wouldn’t take her hand, she slowly pulled back.</p><p>She visibly swallowed and she placed her hands around her glass instead.</p><p>“I couldn’t stop thinking about you after that. I searched everywhere for you. I even bought tickets to shows you were doing but I couldn’t bring myself to… I didn’t trust myself to go.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes again, thinking back on the twenty-something Rio with the big ego who would have died if she’d seen Agatha Harkness rock up to her show again. She’d have collapsed on the spot if the bathroom incident had happened again. She’d have combusted if Agatha would have so much as touched her.</p><p>“It was a month after I saw you that I saw Ralph again. I… it was the first time we’d had sex without a condom. We’d been married for almost five years and… hadn’t really had sex since our wedding night. I was angry. I wanted you and I couldn’t have you and so I had… I had him instead. It was the first time I’d cried during sex. I thought of you, of how your hands had felt in mine, of how you’d smelled up close, of…”</p><p>“Agatha, please don’t.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and cleared her throat quietly, “And… and then just over a month later I got sick. Every morning I was so sick and I knew I must be pregnant. It felt cruel at the time. The one time I’d <em>ever</em> allowed him to… anyway. I was hung up still. Hung up on you and all through my pregnancy I thought of what you might be like if you were there, if…”</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha, please, it’s… it’s too…”</p><p>“Rio, you need to know this. Please I might never get to… I might never get to tell you, please let me tell you.”</p><p>Rio could barely stand it. She wanted to tear her skin off, she wanted to burn her eyes out, she wanted to claw and claw and claw until she could get out.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a while, she let Rio sit in her struggle. She let her digest it and churn it in her stomach, until, eventually, Rio nodded again.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and she started speaking once more: “Ralph wasn’t interested unless someone asked. He lied about coming to appointments with me. He lied about rubbing my feet at night and feeling the baby kick. He… I carried Nicky alone and when I needed to, I thought of you, of who I thought you might be to me. I thought about your smile and your big brown eyes and your soft skin and then when Nicky came along he had all those things. He has those big brown eyes and that goofy grin and-…”</p><p>Rio looked up then, her expression far from goofy, her brow instead practically concave as she looked longingly at the woman who’d just about cracked the most tragic of smiles as she was describing her son.</p><p>“I… at the hotel, after the CCA’s, I asked you how you felt about what Lilia had said about Nicky inheriting the face of someone I love. I believe it. I know it’s so ridiculous, I know it can’t be real but… it has to be. I’ve <em>clung</em> to it all these years.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and hid her face in her hands. She just needed a second, a second to not see or be seen.</p><p>And Agatha gave her that. She gave her ten, twenty, thirty, and then, she spoke again.</p><p>“We’ve lived mostly by ourselves. Ralph usually stays on the east coast or in his condo downtown. Nicky has never really had a father but he’s had me. I’ve tried to put everything good into him and I think that-…”</p><p>“You have,” Rio said suddenly, dropping her hands to see that Agatha’s tears had overspilled now and she was wiping at them with shaking fingers. “That boy is… Agatha, he’s perfect. You made a perfect little boy.”</p><p>Agatha audibly swallowed, a soft squeak of a noise, and she sniffed as she looked down into her glass of wine.</p><p>“We made a life for ourselves. I worked and I came home to Nicky. That was it. Ralph comes home for the holidays or for a red carpet or if my mother…”</p><p>She sighed and wiped quickly at an errant tear, “It’s my mother who forced it. Who suggested it. The marriage, I mean. Ralph comes from good stock. He’s tall and handsome and-… any woman would be lucky to have him.” She spat the last words, said them with such bitterness that Rio bit down on her lip as she watched Agatha gather herself, gather her thoughts.</p><p>“Only he’s selfish and stupid and he couldn’t care less about Nicky. You know what he said when he found out about his hair? He said: ‘good. Perhaps now he’ll …’.” But she stopped herself, clearly unable to finish what exactly Ralph had said.</p><p>Rio clenched her teeth so hard she thought she might break her whole jaw.</p><p>“Nicky knows he’s not interested. He’s smart and sensitive enough to understand that. But I’ve tried to give him enough love that he would never feel without. I’ve done everything in my power to be the opposite of my own mother.”</p><p>“Nicky is evidence that you have been,” Rio said slowly, trying her hardest to relax her tense body. “He’s incredible. You’re an incredible mom.”</p><p>Agatha sniffed quietly and wiped at her eyes.</p><p>“Sometimes I… I used to think when he was little and I saw you across the room at parties, I used to wonder if you’d ever been with a woman who had kids before. If it was something you wanted. If it was something you would ever want to take on… but I never… I never let myself think too much about it. It was too painful to think about. What might have been, what could have been… an actress rocking up one day saying, ‘hey I only met you once but I’m in love with you and anyway here’s my kid with your exact same face let’s shack up’.” She scoffed derisively and Rio went right back to chewing on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>She tasted blood.</p><p>“Anyway. As you started showing up more and more and your name was being said practically everywhere I went I… I thought I’d be okay. I thought I could handle it and then… then you were at the Hollywood Reporter shoot. Just sitting in that makeup chair, just feet from me. And then you were talking to Wanda and I just-…”</p><p><em>Wanda</em>.</p><p>And Rio suddenly remembered another betrayal. The betrayal of the role taken from under Wanda.</p><p>But Agatha was still talking and her brief foray into anger at her died immediately upon her next words: “I wanted to ask you to come home with me. I wanted to hold your hand during that photoshoot and lean down and ask you to come into the makeup trailer with me. I wanted to see if you wanted to kiss me. I wanted to see if-…”</p><p>She stopped herself and Rio watched as she closed her eyes and breathed out heavily, “I just wanted you to see me and I wanted to be around you. I felt more alive than I’d felt in years that day.”</p><p>Rio looked down again, remembered the anxiety she’d had that day, back when Agatha made her nervous, not sick.</p><p>“And then Cannes… when I saw you in the lobby and I was with Ralph. It made me so ashamed. So ashamed that this… this stranger… was going about her life, was just living her life, and there I was, with a husband I hated, having spent the last eight years thinking about her.”</p><p>Rio hid again. She had to. She raised her hands and breathed out against them, covering her whole face in the process.</p><p>It was so much worse than she’d feared it would be.</p><p>If everything Agatha was saying were true then how, <em>how</em> had she done what she’d done?</p><p>How had she gone back to Ralph when surely Rio had given her everything she’d wanted?</p><p>It made no sense.</p><p>And in the confusion, it hurt like hell.</p><p>“I agreed to the vacation in Italy because I couldn’t help myself. I wanted the chance to be closer to you. I wanted to see if I could drink wine with you and flirt a little and see if you’d respond. I wanted to spend the day by the pool with you and casually lean over and kiss you and have you kiss me back. I spent that whole time so desperate and so, god, so fucking out of my mind for you that I could barely think straight. The night, the night you woke up and I was on the balcony, I was just thinking about how this could have been my life. Maybe I could have convinced you to fall for me. Maybe this could have been a trip we were on together, just to get a few days away. and then you wrapped your arms around me in the bed, and I… I had to make you turn, had to hold you instead. Because if you held me then you’d let me go. I couldn’t bear the thought of it so I held onto you and it was the best…”</p><p>Agatha was crying now, properly, and Rio shuffled forwards to reach up and dry her tears. Agatha allowed her, sniffed softly, turning her head into Rio’s hands, “I hadn’t slept so well since I was a child.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, her thumbs now brushing back and forth across Agatha’s cheek as she held her head. Her eyes were closed, and Rio scanned over her features, over the dark bags under her eyes, the hard lines of the lips she was pursing, the curves and junctures of her beautiful face.</p><p>It felt like the first time she was truly realising that she wasn’t the only heartbroken one.</p><p>“I wish you’d said something.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slightly, her hands raising to grasp Rio’s wrists as she opened her eyes. “I was so scared. I thought maybe that would be enough. That I could live with… with just knowing how it felt to hold you.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, her own tears now beginning to fall, “Agatha, I don’t understand. Why are you saying all this when… when you left me. I told you I loved you and-…”</p><p>Agatha sucked in shakily, and her told flexed on Rio’s wrists as she stared across at her. “I’m trying, Rio. Please, I’m trying to explain.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, torn between believing Agatha and believing that she was just spinning a narrative, a story, to make her feel sorry for her, to soften her defences and pull her in once more.</p><p>But she believed the look she was giving her now.</p><p>She believed those watery blue eyes and those soft hands that bore her ring and held her like she meant something.</p><p>And so she began to pull away, only she allowed her hands to be held now. She let Agatha hold her. And Agatha, sniffing softly and visibly in pain, began to talk again.</p><p>“The day you came over… the day we kissed, I hadn’t planned it. I’d decided I could have you in my life. Because the thought of you not being in it was too painful, but that we would just be friends. I thought I could handle that. And then I saw how you were with Nicky, how <em>good</em> you were with him and how he just opened up-… I…”</p><p>Blue eyes disappeared again as Agatha squeezed them tightly shut and Rio had to duck her head down to not see it. She squeezed her own eyes to try and stop the tears but it was no use anymore.</p><p>Everything hurt. Everything felt hopeless.</p><p>“You just,” Agatha began again, once she had a handle on her shaking voice, her hands now not just holding Rio, but gripping her, “you were <em>so</em> good with him and he loved you immediately and I… I needed to kiss you. I needed to feel, even for a second, even if in kissing you my world would burn down… I needed to feel how it would feel to have you, to really <em>have</em> you because it was all I wanted and all I-…” she gasped softly and shook her head.</p><p>Rio kept hers angled down, her eyes now open but staring blindly at their joined hands.</p><p>“I just wanted you so badly. I couldn’t bear not to touch you anymore. I wanted to feel your skin on mine and your lips on-… Rio, I was just… I just needed you. And when we, when you kissed back, when you… I lost it totally. I knew I couldn’t go back to <em>not</em> kissing you.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and closed her eyes, imagining that night now, how nervous she’d been, how shocked and how desperate she’d felt.</p><p>It had felt like a fairytale. Like fiction.</p><p>Especially now.</p><p>She swallowed and slowly raised her gaze to meet Agatha’s and saw before her a totally broken woman, a woman who was now reaching further up her arm, clutching at her sleeves, trying to pull her closer.</p><p>“Please know how badly I wanted you. Please… please understand how you’re it for me. How when I came over that next day I said I was there to make the mistake properly but I… I wanted to touch you and taste you forever. I wanted you to want me too and I-…”</p><p>Agatha dissolved again, crumpled completely and pulled her hands back from Rio to hide herself.</p><p>But Rio was too far gone to notice. She’d hidden her face as soon as she had her hands back. She whimpered and cried into them until she felt Agatha reach for her again, until her hands were being peeled away and until she felt Agatha beside her on the bench, soft and tender as she pressed her face into her cheek and cradled her head against her own.</p><p>Rio cried still, turning into her, until they were two broken women, staring up at one another, breathing each other’s air, tasting each other’s sorrow.</p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, felt Agatha lean in, nudge their noses, and then lean in more.</p><p>But she pulled back, put some distance between them and dropped her head down. Agatha didn’t move for a second and then her hand was back on her cheek and she was pressing a firm, lingering kiss to her crown.</p><p>“This hurts so much, Agatha,” she admitted even as Agatha still pressed into her hair, “why are you making this hurt so much.”</p><p>Agatha breathed in sharply, changed the angle of her head to be able to speak, and when she did Rio felt the brush of her words against her. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I need to tell you everything. I want you to know because I’m so… I’m so scared this will be it and I will never get to tell you how much… I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, trying to clear her mind, trying to be rational, to think even slightly with her logical self. But she feared she was lost. She was so lost in all of this that she couldn’t think of anything that didn’t hurt.</p><p>The words her dad had spoken to her all week, those loving, kind words that she’d used to get her through to this day, were all gone now. She couldn’t find them in the labyrinth of pain.</p><p>Everything was Agatha. Everything was losing Agatha.</p><p>She lifted her head slowly and wiped at her eyes with her light sleeves and to do something she reached for her wine and took a large gulp and heard Agatha shift beside her.</p><p>She’d moved away, she’d given her space.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat as she stared down at the stem of the wine glass and toyed with it absently, her fingers pink and damp from hers or Agatha’s tears.</p><p>“The night in London,” Agatha started slowly, her breathing uneven as Rio closed her eyes again. “You’d been so good with Nicky and I’d missed you so much. When we left the restaurant you were so angry and so protective and I felt, Rio, I felt so ashamed and so, so fucking furious with myself that I couldn’t give myself to you. That I couldn’t let Nicky have you. Because you… you were so intent on protecting us and Ralph never… he never cared… he never tried and-…”</p><p>As Rio looked up Agatha closed her eyes, “I was such a coward. <em>Such</em> a coward. All I could think of was how perfect you were and how bad I was. How I’d been stealing your goodness and giving you… giving you nothing back. That I could <em>never</em> give you anything back because I… I’m a coward.”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly as the repeated word fell into place, as it wriggled its way into her memory and slotted into the words shouted at her in anger, in desperation: “<em>You’re a COWARD, Rio! A COWARD!</em></p><p>“I felt,” Agatha whimpered, “I felt as though… I needed to let you go. I felt as if it were the kindest thing… that you’d grow to hate and resent me anyway and then… then you were on your knees for me a-and I… I was selfish and I wanted… I wanted you one last time. and I needed to hear it, hear you say you loved me just once… and then I thought… I thought that would be it. That I could live forever with the knowledge that once… that once you <em>had</em> loved me. And that I’d felt what it was to be truly loved a-and…”</p><p>Agatha shook her head again and Rio was now wiping furiously at her own face, trying desperately to see when all she felt was tears.</p><p>“I wasn’t, I wasn’t, I-I wasn’t good enough.”</p><p><em>“You could never be enough!”</em></p><p>The pain was visceral now, like being stabbed again and again.</p><p>“A-and then I went back a-and Ralph… he… I knew what the worst thing I could do was. S-so I did it. I let h-him… I slept with him a-and it hurt and I hated it a-and… I needed to punish myself. I had to punish-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio sobbed out, her whole body trembling now, her whole self utterly broken, “Please… Please don’t… I can’t hear anymore, I-… <em>p-please</em>.”</p><p>“You h-have to understand, please, <em>please</em>, Rio. I did it to h-hurt me, I didn’t… it was never to h-hurt you and I… I realised as soon as-…”</p><p>“Agatha, please… please stop…”</p><p>“I… I knew what I’d d-done only after I’d done it a-and that I wanted… Rio… I… Quería ser valiente. Q-quiero ser valiente.” <em>I wanted to be brave. I w-want to be brave.</em></p><p>Rio’s mind was a tortured thing. A desperate, screaming thing. She could no longer hear Agatha, not really. The words were registering only as gashes against her soul. She was being torn open and ripped apart with every syllable.</p><p>She buried her head in her hands again, sobbing audibly because she couldn’t hold it in anymore. And then Agatha was around her. Agatha was holding her and she couldn’t pull away. She didn’t want to.</p><p>The woman who’d torn her open was now holding her together.</p><p>“Rio Rio Rio,” Agatha began to chant her name, whispering it against her hair as she sobbed into her. She clung at her shirt, making the clean white fabric now a mess of snot and tears. And Agatha held on, she held her so fiercely that Rio’s violent sobs made Agatha vibrate, and they shared the pain of them, as they shared the pain of this.</p><p>It took minutes, but Agatha didn’t relent in her hold. She didn’t loosen her grip or pull away. She just kept saying Rio’s name until it morphed into “lo siento, mi amor, lo siento” whispered over and over again.</p><p>As the sobs became hiccups Rio pressed her face painfully into Agatha’s chest. She wanted to dissolve into her. She wanted to live in her skin and feel her blood pulsing through her veins. She wanted to know the whisperings of her bones and the echoes in her heart.</p><p>She wanted her wildly, unrelentingly, despite the pain she was in, perhaps because of it.</p><p>A rumbling in Agatha’s chest told her that she was now taking in deep, heavy breaths and Rio only pressed closer as Agatha began to speak properly again.</p><p>“I was s-so angry a-and so scared I-… I made the worst mistake o-of my life and I wanted… I knew I had to tell you. I knew I-I needed to tell you i-immediately and then…”</p><p>Agatha’s swallow became a squeak as Rio had begun to shift against her. She was pulling up and hiccuping as she did. But she wasn’t pulling back. Her face was now glued to Agatha’s skin, trailing its misery in thick wet lines up her chest and along her throat, up until the bridge of her nose was against the corner of Agatha’s jaw and she could breathe in her perfume as she spoke, “Please don’t Agatha.”</p><p>It didn’t sound like her voice. It was deeper and more gravelly than she’d ever heard it.  Perhaps Agatha’s words had slashed through her vocal chords too. Perhaps every part of her had been decimated and now she was just a shell, just a broken heart barely beating.</p><p>She raised her hand from where it still clutched Agatha’s shirt to hold Agatha’s cheek and she lifted her head up and looked properly into Agatha’s blood-red eyes and saw her own pain reflected right back at her.</p><p>“I hate hearing…” She took a breath and Agatha whimpered quietly, fighting her own tears as they freely streamed down her face. “I c-can’t hear anymore, A-Agatha. I l-love you so much. I can’t… I can’t… please don’t make me please don’t make me.”</p><p>Another sob wracked through her body unexpectedly and Agatha pulled her back into, holding her head to her own and pulling her so Rio was crying against her face. It wasn’t clear whose tears belonged to who.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t breathe for the pain she was in, for the pain she knew Agatha must have been in the night she felt she deserved to be punished rather than to be loved by her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed out after Rio’s sobs died again and she was instead just hiccuping and clutching at her. “Rio,” she said again, this time making her intentions clear as she manoeuvred pliable Rio into her lap and Rio curled around her, hiding her face against her neck.</p><p>Agatha held her until the hiccups slowed, until Rio was breathing audibly, until her clutching became holding.</p><p>“W-when I saw…” Agatha started cautiously, rubbing Rio’s back as she spoke close by her ear, “The next morning… when I saw that bruise on y-your neck I… I panicked… I was so afraid it meant you… you already had one foot out the door and I… I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t…”</p><p>Rio began to pull back then and Agatha gasped and clutched at her, but Rio only wanted to rest their foreheads together, blindly seeking more closeness even as she had her knees either side of her hips, her hands buried in long, wavy hair.</p><p>“I…” Agatha tried again, “I couldn’t tell you when I thought… I thought… a-and then,” Agatha’s breath was warm and familiar against Rio’s aching face, and the feel of it helped soothe the sting of her words. “A-and Jen found out. She heard us. And I had nothing to lose anymore e-except you so I told her. I told her that for eight years I’d pined, that I’d n-named Nicky… I’d given him your name… and I told her, my love, I told her what I’d done.”</p><p>Even this close, even so close Rio could count every freckle, Rio saw Agatha’s whole face crumple. She hiccuped softly as she brought her hands in closer to brush the soft skin beneath her eyes and she watched as Agatha closed them, and felt the hands on her back slide down to hold her hips, to try and get her closer.</p><p>“She told me-… she told me to tell you a-and I agreed so I… I made a plan,.. that night in the hotel… Rio I planned to tell you that night. I-I wanted it to be romantic and I bought that l-lingerie. I wanted to be good for you. I wanted to make you feel good. To show you h-how much I cared and wanted you and wanted you to… to want me too.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, looking back on the night she’d thought was just fun, was just romance and sex, when really Agatha had been trying to prove something to herself, all the while keeping this terrible secret from Rio.</p><p>“Baby, I… I wanted so badly to tell you. But I couldn’t find the words and I was… I’m a coward, Rio, I’m a coward.”</p><p>Rio gulped in the air she desperately needed to keep alive and she shifted, she shifted so that Agatha’s still-tugging hands could relax. She shifted forwards, closer, pressing her whole body now against Agatha’s.</p><p>It was damp and sticky but she was warm and familiar and god Rio had missed her body so much.</p><p>The curve of her spine, the soft skin of her stomach, the mound of her perfect tits, those strong, Pilates-honed arms. Everything about Agatha was mesmerising. She was formed just for her. She was sculpted by some generous, magnanimous deity just for Rio.</p><p>And yet somewhere things had become confused.</p><p>This perfect woman had been placed with an unfit, unfeeling mother. She’d been made to feel less than her perfection. She’d become warped in her view of herself. She’d been so neglected that even when given the love she so desperately wanted she’d turned away, and punished herself for it.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio croaked out in defiance of Evanora’s hold on her daughter as her fingers trailed down damp cheeks and lined up along a quivering jawline. “I love you with everything I have, a-and everything I am. And I will never love anyone else. I will never be able to. I was made only for you. And I think, Agatha, <em>mi amor</em> I think that you were made only for me.”</p><p>Agatha was crying more now, shaking beneath Rio as she absorbed her words.</p><p>“I am sorry you were frightened. I am so fucking s-sorry you slept with him to p-punish, god, to punish yourself for… fuck. For…”</p><p>She gave up, closing her eyes as she tried to steady her breathing again. “You have h-hurt me more than I can… more than I can bear…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha whimpered out, and Rio watched as the panic began to rise in blue eyes and as her hold became fierce again, as she moved her hands to find purchase anywhere she could on Rio, to keep her there, to keep her with her.</p><p>“No, please. No please no please nopleasenononono.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, feeling the panic rise in her too like a rising tide sinks that all ships.</p><p>But perhaps it was because she hadn’t pulled away, or perhaps Agatha just lost her fire but she soon wrapped her arms around Rio and buried her face in against her neck as she cried silently and Rio changed her hold to cradle her head.</p><p>“I-I need you, I, please… I’m leaving him, Rio. I… I’m leaving him, I’m leaving him, I’m-…”</p><p>Rio released a quiet noise, and bent her head down towards Agatha, dislodging her, making her turn so their faces were a breath apart, and Agatha hesitated for just a second before she said again: “I’m leaving him.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, felt the familiar nudge of Agatha’s nose against her own and then the gentle warmth as she whispered, “My lawyers have been… they’ve been working o-on it. I want Nicky. J-just Nicky. I have a prenup and… all I want is my son.”</p><p>Rio nodded slightly, barely moving her head a centimetre each way. Her hands came down again, held Agatha’s cheeks, kept her still, kept her close. “Agatha, I-…”</p><p>“Will you be there? Will-… have I ruined it? H-have I fucked it up, Rio? Have I-…?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, her voice now coming back to its usually tone, but unsteady still, unsure. “Would you e-even want me? I… you said-… in Berkeley…”</p><p>“No, baby, my love, my-… no. I was so so frightened I didn’t, please I wanted you to fight, I-… I wanted you to fight me I-…”</p><p>Rio nodded, because she knew. Agatha had tried to get a reaction that wasn’t just Rio leaving. She’d tried for a reaction that would prove in some twisted way that Rio cared enough to give one. But Rio had cared so much she’d had no choice but to leave.</p><p>“I’m sorry for what I did,” Agatha breathed out, and Rio pressed in, moving an inch to press her lips to Agatha’s cheek. “I-I will spend my whole life trying to make it up to you. Please… I want to be good for you. I want to be so good for you, Rio. I love you. I love you.”</p><p>Rio nodded against her, her eyes screwed tightly closed as she rested against her temple. It was so muddled now, so confused. The pain was still there, still coursing through her veins. But she wanted Agatha so badly that there was a calmness to it now. The pain wasn’t any less painful, but it was less violent.</p><p>“I love you too,” was all she managed, all she could say.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and flexed her hold around Rio’s waist.</p><p>“He’s being served,” she said tentatively, almost timidly, “in three weeks. The house i-is mine, is in, is in my name but, I know the press will be incessant. I know Ralph will come back. I know my mother… I’m going to move out, to a smaller, hidden place, deeper in the hills. Just me and Nicky, just Jen will know and-… and you. A-and, maybe, maybe you could come, maybe you could stay. Maybe you could-…” she swallowed and Rio moved back an inch to take in her face properly, to watch the struggle as she went to ask the question, “maybe you could live with us.”</p><p>Agatha Harkness was everything Rio Vidal had ever wanted.</p><p>She’d lusted after her since she was a teenager. She’d fallen as much in love with her as it was possible to through a screen. And then she’d met her and she’d tumbled into actual, true love without even realising.</p><p>And so hearing this, hearing that Agatha wanted her to move in, that she loved her enough to want her with her and her son, under every other fathomable circumstance it would have been a joyous, wondrous thing.</p><p>But now it felt something else.</p><p>It felt not joyous, and not wondrous.</p><p>Rio dropped her head down and heard Agatha as she whimpered in pain. She moved her hand to clutch briefly at Agatha’s shirt and then she released her and she began to pull away.</p><p>Agatha didn’t fight.</p><p>She managed to stand on shaking legs and she wiped furiously at her face with her sodden sleeves. She took a deep breath and in doing so she turned back to Agatha who had crumpled where she sat. Her head was against the knees she’d pulled up to hug close to her chest and she was crying silently as Rio spoke.</p><p>“I’ve spoken to my dad this week m-more times than I spoke to him all year last year. I-I’ve told him e-everything and I have listened to him a-as he told me… Agatha as he told me that you were frightened a-and we do strange things when we’re frightened. He told me to listen to my pain, and that where pain is worse, love is deepest. He-he told me to take time to heal until I came here a-and this morning he told me… he told me that he knew you were the one for me when you laughed at his stupid jokes, w-when you brought me up i-in every conversation, e-even when you were talking a-about the trees in their yard, a-and when you rocked up, a white girl from Massachusetts, and spoke in fluent Spanish without e-even blinking, because it was respectful, because it was- because it was just the right a-and best thing to do.”</p><p>Agatha was peaking up at her now, her blue eyes with their fearful red rims.</p><p>“He-he told me that I have a good heart a-and if I love you enough I can get through this and <em>Agatha</em> I love you so fucking much. So fucking much! A-and I’m so… I’m so worried that-…. I feel so… Agatha this hurts so much. You’ve hurt me so-… so much.”</p><p>Rio exclaimed a noise of frustration, and crossed her forearms over her face as she took slow, deliberate breaths to try and calm herself down again.</p><p>“I want to protect you. I want… I <em>know</em> I can keep you safe. I know I can make you happy and feel loved. I know I can help with N-Nicky. I know I can carry you both. But I worry… Agatha… Agatha I worry you won’t let me a-and you’ll do… you’ll hurt me again only… only I won’t recover from it. Agatha I won’t recover, Agatha I…. Please… I won’t-…”</p><p>She gasped, loud and deep.</p><p>Agatha had collided with her. She’d thrown herself from the bench and straight into Rio. It was instant, the relief that it brought. Just to have Agatha there. Just to have her hold her. Just to feel that desperate, possessive grip she had.</p><p>Rio held her back, she wrapped herself so solidly around her it would have taken a miracle to break them apart.</p><p>Agatha held Rio until her tears dried and when, hiccuping again, she felt well enough to speak, Agatha loosened her hold. “I need, I just need a second… just a second…”</p><p>Agatha released her and Rio didn’t look before she stumbled away and to the bathroom. Rio could breathe again only when she was alone, only when she placed her hands either side of the cool basin and she hiccuped in the empty room.</p><p>Her heart was carrion now, left rotting in her chest for the crows that circled above. She felt empty. “No se puede servir de una taza vacía.” <em>You can’t pour from an empty cup.</em></p><p>Her dad’s voice was back, accompanied by her mom’s face as she rolled her eyes at her husband’s latest flavour of beermat philosophy. And Rio almost laughed as her parents’ filled her up again, and then their memory faded to blue eyes so desperate and so despairing.</p><p>She had to go back. She had to hear everything Agatha had to tell her.</p><p>And then she had to process. Then she had to push through the pain.</p><p>Because she loved her, god she loved her.</p><p>She had a choice to make that could only be made when she had given Agatha the chance, every possible chance, to tell her everything she needed to know.</p><p>With warm water she splashed her face and dried it with a nearby hand-towel. The fabric was soft and welcome against her raw cheeks and swollen eyes. She looked in the mirror only when she was clean of tears and what she saw made her grimace.</p><p>Her brown eyes were glassy and seemed now too large for her face. The whites were riddled with angry red veins though Rio felt only pain; she had no energy for anger right now. Her eyes blinked and was slow, like her body was slowly shutting down, like it was trying to preserve itself for what was to come.</p><p>She had to look away, she had to turn from her pink nose and blotchy, irritated skin. She had to go back to Agatha and face into this once more.</p><p>With heavy feet and a hollow chest, she did.</p><p>Agatha was sat on the very edge of the bench, her head in her hands, but she straightened the moment Rio came back and she looked frightened, even more so than before.</p><p>“I still have questions,” Rio husked out, moving some distance away to sit at the kitchen island. The stool wobbled as she, with unsteady limbs, climbed onto it.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, turning to watch her, her posture still hunched, closing in on herself, “Anything.”</p><p>Rio was raw and emptied out but the only way out was through so she asked: “How did it feel?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched but Rio didn’t elaborate and Agatha only nodded, understood what she was being asked as Rio clutched her hands in her lap.</p><p>“It hurt. I… it hurt and I knew, I didn’t want it.”</p><p>“Did he… Agatha, did he force you?”</p><p>Why hadn’t she considered it? Why had it never crossed her mind?</p><p>Agatha was silent. Silent for perhaps a second too long and Rio stumbled from her seat as Agatha stood suddenly and they stared at each other; two cowboys, unarmed.</p><p>“I did it willingly, Rio.” It cut so deep it was almost as if Agatha’s whisper had suddenly become a shout. “I didn’t say no. He didn’t force it.”</p><p>Relief flickered briefly but like a candle in the wind died upon its birth and the reality of Agatha again choosing Ralph, choosing Ralph to punish herself as she now knew, settled back in her bruised chest.</p><p>She didn’t sit back down.</p><p>Agatha didn’t either.</p><p>“Did he… did you use protection?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened, her lower lip quivered, and then she said: “Yes. He wore a condom.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked down. She could feel her palms sweating as they hung loosely by her sides. The thought of Ralph being inside Agatha was making her feel sick again but the thought of him coming inside her, the even slight chance that he could get her pregnant again, it was too much.</p><p>Her brain was whirring with so many thoughts and so many images of Ralph, tall, handsome Ralph, rutting over Agatha that she couldn’t help the next question that slipped out: “Did you kiss him?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her gaze down still. Agatha’s legs were still in view, the pale hands that twisted and twisted the diamond ring on her left hand.</p><p>“Since we’ve been together… since we started this… was that the only time?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Did you sleep with him after?”</p><p>“No. I… I showered and went to my own bed. I couldn’t sleep. All I could think of was telling you. Was getting on my knees a-and-…”</p><p>Rio had scoffed, had raised her hands to cover her face as the absurdity of Agatha’s statement washed over her, “I waited for you all night, Agatha. I… I waited for you to come back to me.”</p><p>“I-I know. I… I should have come to you. I should have told you immediately. I… I knew immediately, Rio. I had been so angry and then I was just scared. So scared I’d fucked it up. That I’d lost you because I…”</p><p>Rio shook her head and dropped her hands again and looked back up to Agatha. She’d stepped closer at some point, her left hand now reaching towards her through the distance. “I convinced myself I’d lose you anyway and I wanted to hurt myself because the thought of you deciding you’d leave me was… I couldn’t bear it. And then as soon as I’d forced it. As soon as he was off me and-,” Rio had squeaked, whimpering as she swallowed her tears, “I wanted to take it back. I wanted you. I wanted you to… I just wanted you.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and took a blind step backwards until she collided with the island behind her. She needed the reassurance that she wouldn’t fall because she felt so unsteady.</p><p>“Tell me why, why you’d think I’d leave. I need to understand, Agatha. I need-…”</p><p>“I’m older than you,” Agatha gasped out as if she’d been waiting for this question, “I have a son. I’m not out. I wasn’t ready to be out. I’m married and I hadn’t…”</p><p>“Two of those things you said you’re working on,” Rio said quietly, her eyes closed and her mind still on Ralph kissing his wife.</p><p>“Yes. Yes I’m leaving him. I… I saw how good you were with Nicky and I just kept thinking that if you turned around and said you wanted a kid of your own you might… you might want someone younger. You might want your first kid to be with-…”</p><p>“The problem with that, Agatha,” Rio said in a voice that had found its strength again, and she opened her eyes once more, “is that I love <em>your</em> kid. And I know he isn’t mine. I would never force it… but I want him to be. I’d-…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha murmured, “Rio, I… I know that, I <em>know</em> that. I just… I was so scared. At night I kept convincing myself you’d be happier with-…”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly and Agatha’s eyes flashed as the dots connected and colour filtered into the picture. The colour red. “Wanda. It’s Wanda, isn’t it? You thought… Agatha, that’s so…”</p><p>“You were playing her wife, you are the same age, she has no responsibilities, no baggage, she’s softer than I am, she’s-…”</p><p>Rio just shook her head and the psychology of Agatha Harkness was laid bare before her. It was complicated and twisted versions of the truth, but she now understood how she’d come to those conclusions in her mind and why she’d stolen Wanda’s role.</p><p>“Christmas wives,” she concluded quietly, watching as Agatha nodded at her, as she took a step closer. "It's why you hate her. I knew you were jealous but...</p><p>“It doesn’t make sense to me that you love me.”</p><p>Rio deflated, glad of the solid presence behind her that meant she wouldn’t collapse, at least not physically.</p><p>“You could have a life with someone so much <em>easier</em> than me. Someone who isn’t-…”</p><p>“I want you!” Rio shouted suddenly, exploded where she stood, her hands flying up as if catapulted by her cry. “I love you! I would take hard and <em>painful</em> over anything anyone else could give me because it would be with <em>you</em>!”</p><p>Agatha just stared, having barely flinched when Rio bellowed.</p><p>“Agatha! God! Being with you is so <em>easy</em>, can’t you see that? Can’t you <em>feel</em> that? When it’s just us or us and Nicky and-… and we’re together it’s just… it’s so <em>easy</em>. And now, <em>now</em> it’s hard. Now it <em>hurts</em> but I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t want it to be easy again. If I didn’t want…”</p><p>As the crescendo slipped into diminuendo Rio relaxed back and Agatha took a step closer, “I love you. I want to be with you. I don’t know how I can convince you of that but I’ll spend the rest of my life-…” she sighed and closed her eyes, “I love you. That’s all there is.”</p><p>Her hands gripped the marble behind her and Agatha only stared, not crying anymore, and by the looks of it barely breathing.</p><p>“I want to be worthy of you.”</p><p>“You are.”</p><p>“No, I, I mean…” Agatha stepped unsteadily forwards and Rio’s arm twitched as she stopped. “I’ve an appointment with, remember that doctor I told you about? To help. To… I know I need to speak to someone. I know that... I know you deserve a healed partner.”</p><p>Rio sighed, watching as Agatha’s blue eyes travelled down her body to her white-knuckled hands, “l’ll be divorced soon, I’ll have, I think I can get full custody of Nicky but I… would you want that? This… us?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out as Agatha stepped closer and finally, finally was within reach. But Agatha reached for her first. She placed her hands on her waist and held her firmly, and it was Agatha who spoke before Rio could answer her question:</p><p>“Alice told Jen you’ve not been eating.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know why Agatha had changed tact. But her body relaxed as she did, and maybe that was answer enough.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“I can feel it in your body. Let me make you something.”</p><p>Rio sighed once more, reaching to place her hands on Agatha’s shoulders - a safe zone. “I saw you push your food around the other day. You’re not exactly-…”</p><p>“It’s my house. I’m making you food.”</p><p>Rio huffed out something that resembled a laugh and watched as Agatha marched away from her, all determination. It was a reprieve. Agatha was giving them both some time to breathe, some time to think, some time, perhaps, to just be easy together.</p><p>Rio turned on the spot and leant down on her elbows as she watched Agatha move about the large space, fetching ingredients. She could have been fooled into thinking this was just any regular night. Agatha looked softer now she was making herself useful.</p><p>And Rio watched her from her position for a while before she spoke again, “How're you feeling about coming out?”</p><p>Agatha paused as she was reaching for something in the back of the fridge and Rio bit down in her lip as she waited. “Scared.”</p><p>Rio nodded and cleared her throat quietly, “It’s a big step.”</p><p>Agatha was looking at her now, a slight frown on her face, “But I want to take it. I want the world to know you’re-…”</p><p>“Agatha, are you coming out just for me?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed said nothing. She closed the door and turned away and Rio moved slowly around the island, “The past few days… Agatha I’ve noticed the change in you.”</p><p>Agatha was grating cheese now, angling her head away from Rio. “You know I’d never force you to come out. I want you to be ready. I want you-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha looked around and stopped what she was doing, her blue eyes glassy again, “I’ve lost you. Maybe forever. And so when I say I’m scared… it’s nothing compared to a life without you in it. So I’m going to come out, as soon as I’m divorced. As soon as I can. And in the time in between…”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, placed a hand on Agatha’s hip. “I-in the time in between, I hope you’ll take me back. I hope that,” Rio moved in, kissed Agatha’s shoulder, “I hope we can work on this. That I can do the work to make you trust me again.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say so she kissed Agatha again, squeezed her hip, and slowly Agatha turned back to what she was doing. Rio lingered for only a few seconds before she moved away, but not far.</p><p>She leant against the side by the cooker and tumbled everything around in the empty drum of her mind.</p><p>Agatha had lived her life in fear and misery, with only Nicky for light. Then Rio had stepped in, and perhaps the light had shone brighter, but creatures used the the dark cower back into it - and Agatha had done just that.</p><p>Only without Rio, the dark had soon become less a comfort and more a curse. And now Agatha was raging against it, but in a quiet, soft way. She was no longer screaming. She was digging in, making a home, making plans, so if Rio ever turned back, she’d be ready for her.</p><p>It was evident in the way she’d been this past week, in the changes she’d already made. It was evident that in her abject misery she was now slicing bread, now buttering it, now turning the heat on the stove and preparing the ingredients for an indulgent grilled cheese.</p><p>It would have been so easy to collapse into her, to give in.</p><p>But she didn’t, at least not yet.</p><p>Rio watched the hand that wore her ring as it pushed the grilled cheese about the pan. Like a magpie drawn to the sparkliest thing in its vicinity, she found herself transfixed as Agatha wielded the spatula like she’d won an Michelin star as well as an Oscar.</p><p>“I thought of you too, you know.” She was hypnotised, like a man-cub in the thralls of Kaa, “For years. I first saw you in <em>Wild Horses</em> at the movie theatre downtown. You had that pink shirt and those cowboy boots… your hair was,” she gestured vaguely, “all wild and… and I just, I went back to see it three more times.”</p><p>The spell broken as Agatha twisted her hand and the stone disappeared.</p><p>Rio looked up and Agatha was chewing on her lip, seemingly lost in thought as the grilled cheese flipped.</p><p>“That was a bad movie.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and Agatha looked round at her, her own soft smile on her face.</p><p>“You saw it four times?”</p><p>“And a million more whenever I closed my eyes.”</p><p>Blue eyes dropped a few inches to Rio’s grinning mouth and Rio stepped a little closer. “I was a teenager with a raging crush and then… then a twenty-something, with a raging crush, and then I met you and… you became real… and…” she reached out and touched Agatha’s arm, “then I guess I just kept falling.”</p><p>“You thought of me? When… I mean, those years I was thinking of you?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and was about to answer when the smell of burning filled her nostrils and they both turned as Agatha lifted the pan off the heat and cursed softly.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio reassured as she went to grab a plate. “I like it a little crispy.”</p><p>In the cupboard she noticed the pile of plates was severely lacking and a voice filtered into her conscious as she fished one out: <em>“She’s smashed plates and yelled herself hoarse and couldn’t even keep it together when Nicky came to see.”</em></p><p>She cleared her throat and made her way back over to Agatha with the plate.</p><p>She knew she’d have to ask.</p><p>But maybe it would be easier once they’d both had a bite to eat.</p><p>“We’re sharing this, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed but Rio raised her brows and didn’t move an inch as she stared her down. Agatha eyed her for a moment after placing the sandwich on the plate and put the pan back on the side. “You think you can intimidate me?”</p><p>“I think you want to share this grilled cheese with me.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed again, her jaw flexing, but then she nodded, a tiny, infinitesimal movement but enough to make Rio turn, seek out a knife, and take a seat at the island where Agatha moved to sit beside her.</p><p>“I made it for you.”</p><p>“Well it’s nice to share.”</p><p>Agatha went silent again as Rio cut it in half diagonally, and she lifted the first of the triangles to hand to Agatha. It was greasy, buttery, and hot. And it was beginning to burn the sensitive pads of her fingers as Agatha deliberated on taking it.</p><p>“It’s hot, Agatha,” Rio prompted.</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and instead of taking it she stubbornly took a bite and then reeled back with a steaming mouth and a panicked look in her eye. It made Rio laugh even as she dropped the sandwich and placed her thumb and forefinger into her mouth to soothe her own burn.</p><p>Agatha whimpered and then hissed and it looked like it took a lot for her to just swallow down the mouthful of molten cheese. When she managed it Rio smiled and slipped from her seat to fetch her wine and bring it over to her.</p><p>“Serves you right for being so stubborn.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha whispered as she accepted her glass and took two big gulps. “It’s <em>your</em> grilled cheese.”</p><p>Rio said nothing as she gingerly peeled the pieces of bread apart and watched the steam rise. She just stared at it for a while, allowing Agatha to watch <em>her</em> in the process.</p><p>Despite everything, despite finally getting some answers and some she certainly didn’t like, her body felt calm now. She was in a familiar place, with her familiar person.</p><p>Agatha <em>was</em> her person. She’d found her through the screen, and then after a show, across rooms, in this very home. She’d continue to find her through lifetimes and into eternity.</p><p>As the steam began to dissipate and Rio dropped the bread, and held up the already bitten sandwich to Agatha again. “It should be okay.”</p><p>Instead of taking it Agatha bit into it once more, a large, obnoxious bite right in the centre of the sandwich, trusting Rio was right. She seemed to be. Agatha didn’t reel back again, she instead chewed quickly, and watched Rio as she turned the sandwich towards herself and took a bite that overlapped Agatha’s.</p><p>They kept on exchanging the sandwich, Agatha having instigated it. She’d leant forwards after Rio’s bite and maintaining eye contact she’d opened her mouth, her pink burnt tongue the perfect proffered landing place for the buttery sandwich.</p><p>Agatha was forcing intimacy, a connection across a sandwich, and Rio couldn’t deny her. She was showing her tongue each time, like a pupping exposing her belly, showing she could be vulnerable, that she was ready for everything Rio could give her.</p><p>Rio took the penultimate bite and she didn’t register whether she was being selfless or selfish as she left half a bite for Agatha to take, hoping that exactly what happened would.</p><p>Agatha took the bite, having each time, before Rio even turned the sandwich to her, opened her mouth as an offering.</p><p>And this time, with little bread or cheese to play with, she accepted the tips of Rio’s warm fingers between her lips too. Rio gasped quietly as the feel of Agatha’s hot mouth enveloped her to her first knuckle. She let Agatha suck a little, met her darkening gaze as she did, and then pulled her hand away so Agatha could swallow, and so Rio could breathe.</p><p>“We shouldn’t do that,” she whispered quietly, watching Agatha part her lips and lick the grease from them. “It’s a bad idea.”</p><p>“Stay tonight,” Agatha responded, reaching out to hold Rio’s arm, “Stay. Please.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t say no, didn’t <em>want</em> to say no, so instead she just picked up the second half of their now shared sandwich and held it out to Agatha again.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, looked to Rio, seemed to weigh something up, and then her mouth fell open once more. Only this time she didn’t lean in. Rio leant into her.</p><p>They were silent until the sandwich was gone but this time Rio made sure she got the last bite. As she chewed, Agatha watched her, she leant closer, she touched her leg, “Stay. Please, my love.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat quietly, feeling her mouth suddenly go dry despite the excess amount of butter and cheese she’d just consumed. “I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“You don’t want me?”</p><p>Rio sighed and closed her eyes, feeling the journey of soft fingers as they crept up to her hips and twisted themselves around her belt hoop.</p><p>She needed to be able to think again, needed a distraction from the thoughts of Agatha’s willing mouth and her grabbing hands.</p><p>“Tell me something,” Rio said, turning back to Agatha and seeing the pain across her features again. “Something you’ve never said to me before. Give me something. Something not painful.”</p><p>Agatha looked confused and then, and then… her face relaxed, she looked calm, and her lips even twitched just a little as Rio saw the exact moment she settled on the secret she would give.</p><p>“I like to stand on your right side. Because I like to hold you with my left hand. Because holding you feels important. It often feels like the most important thing I'll do all day.”</p><p>As far as Rio Vidal was concerned, you could burn your roses, you could crush your diamonds, you could rip up your sonnets, because this, Agatha believing that holding her was <em>important</em>, so much so that she consciously stood so she could hold her the way she wanted, in her left hand, her dominant hand, was the most romantic thing anyone had ever said to her.</p><p>She must have been silent for a while because Agatha had tilted her head and was watching Rio for signs of life.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“I… yeah…” Rio cleared her throat, unsure whether or not it was good to know this as her thoughts flew back to Agatha’s fingers as they twitched where they still held her. Agatha’s gaze flitted down to Rio’s lips and back up again.</p><p>“What else? What else do you want to know?”</p><p>Rio swallowed, moved her hand down to extricate Agatha’s fingers, to turn her hand over and kiss her palm.</p><p>She had to dive back in or she’d give in to a warm mouth and talented hands.</p><p>“Are you still angry? With yourself, I mean?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio shook her head a little and sighed before she kissed over Agatha’s knuckles this time. “No, I mean… do you think you’re angry enough to do what you did… again?”</p><p>“No. Rio,” Agatha looked away and closed her eyes and Rio watched as she took a few deep breaths before she turned back to her, “I’m angry because now the worst thing has happened. Because <em>I</em> have done the worst thing. I just want you. Please…” Rio stood up and turned Agatha’s stool, she stood close and Agatha opened her legs to welcome her closer. Agatha took a breath as Rio raised their joined hands again to kiss the side of her thumb and Agatha’s lashes fluttered as she said, “I want you, Rio. And I’ll be angry forever but… only enough to make me better for you. I’m trying. Please I want to try.”</p><p>Agatha’s free hand moved to Rio’s lower back and Rio allowed herself to be pulled in. She bent down and Agatha gasped as they rested their foreheads together and she released her hand so they could fold together properly, Rio’s arms draped now around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I think I have loved you for almost half my life. I saw you at seventeen, and you’ve been in my heart ever since. No other woman-… Agatha no one’s ever stood a chance and I never understood, because I… I didn’t know I’d been made for you until it was too late. And this… I want this to work. I want to be with you and love you and <em>be</em> loved by you… I…”</p><p>“Move in with me,” Agatha said suddenly, tightening her hold, “Move in with me. We can be together. We can be… Rio I’ll be divorced by the time… in six months… a-and we can be together now, before then, just us, us and Nicky. And then… I’ll make a statement, I’ll say we fell in love on set, you helped me through my divorce, and now we’re in love and we’re so, <em>so</em> happy.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes because of course Agatha had planned it, of <em>course</em> she had.</p><p>She’d planned a way for them, a road ahead.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed out, gasping quietly when Agatha’s hands slipped below her shirt. Her touch was as soft as ever but the trails her fingers blazed as they brushed up to her ribs left a line of heat that Rio still wasn’t strong enough to handle. “I need to think. It’s so much. It’s… I can’t think when you’re touching me.”</p><p>Slow fingers danced their way back down and Agatha, depleted, placed just the tips of them against Rio’s clothed hips.</p><p>“I’m sorry to ask again but-…”</p><p>Agatha dropped her head until it pressed against Rio’s chest and Rio cradled her there, scratching softly at her scalp. “You need time.”</p><p>Rio nodded though her body screamed. She wanted Agatha. She wanted everything with Agatha. Why was this so hard? Why was this happening?</p><p>“I just-…”</p><p>“You don’t trust me,” Agatha said tragically, lifting her her again slowly and breaking Rio’s hold on her, “I know. I know you don’t and… I’ve been trying, I’ve…”</p><p>Rio sighed, closed her eyes, as Agatha’s words washed over her once more: “I know you have.” She sucked in a breath as she said, “God Agatha that car was such a bad move.”</p><p>Agatha gasped a laugh against her, angling her head up to place a kiss against Rio’s chest, “I was so pissed with Jen. She wouldn’t shut up about it when she found out. She told me I was-…”</p><p>“An idiot?”</p><p>“Something along those lines.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, her head at an uncomfortable angle so she could gaze down at Agatha and she pulled away to look at her properly. Agatha allowed it but shifted partially off her stool to keep her hold on Rio.</p><p>“Was it the colour or…?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, briefly taken in by Agatha’s question before she noticed the ghost of a smirk across her lips and she laughed as she shook her head, “You <em>are</em> an idiot.”</p><p>“Teach me. Teach me not to be.”</p><p>Agatha was tugging at her again, pulling her that bit closer. “You’re doing a much better job now.” Rio smiled sadly, traced the pads of her fingers along Agatha’s cheek. “Tell me about Nicky. Jen told me he heard you smash some plates.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed and Rio was quick to say: “It’s okay. I smashed a tequila bottle.”</p><p>“She told me.”</p><p>Rio nodded and traced her fingers down to Agatha’s jaw. “Tell me.”</p><p>“He… that first night he was so frightened. He didn’t understand. I’ve never lost it like that in front of him. But I got him back to bed and he eventually went to sleep and… in the morning I explained I’d had a bad day and that I was sorry and it wouldn’t happen again. But he’s been asking me everyday if I’m sad and how he can help and-…” Rio moved her thumb up to trace below Agatha’s watering eyes, “When Jen came to get me yesterday I panicked because, I knew he was safe with you so I didn’t… I thought maybe… I don’t know what I thought. But when I saw why he was upset I was so relieved. Because he loves you. And he can’t understand how much. But I can. Because I can see my love for you reflected in him.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip, catching each slow tear that fell from Agatha’s eyes with the pad of her thumb. “You know I love him too.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“He’s not baggage to me. He never could be.”</p><p>“A bonus?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, released a sad sort of laugh and nodded at the words Agatha repeated back to her from a conversation in a car when everything had been different, “A bonus.”</p><p>Rio moved her hands to push through Agatha’s now knotty hair and she watched the progress of her right hand as her left still held Agatha’s face gently in place. It allowed her to think, the motion of it, the slight tug of each twist and knot she found, and she could feel her heartbeat slow as the woman before her watched her with a tender gaze.</p><p>“I should leave, Agatha. We both should sleep and tomorrow, tomorrow we can talk again. Take it slow.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled audibly, and Rio turned back to her, stopping her movements in her hair, “You won’t stay?”</p><p>“It’s not a good idea.”</p><p>Agatha gulped this time and Rio smiled sadly, “Thank you for the grilled cheese.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered as Rio kissed her cheek, “Please stay.”</p><p>“I can’t, Agatha.”</p><p>She forced herself to pull away, turning her back on Agatha as she made slow progress to the front door.</p><p>“You won’t… god Rio, this isn’t it? Is this it?”</p><p>Rio had made it to the door now and turned to see Agatha standing there, her previously calm features now screwed up in worry, “It’s not it?”</p><p>“No, mi amor. I just need…” Agatha stepped closer, reached for Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“<em>Tell me.</em>”</p><p>Rio swallowed: “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and moved into her, her whole face crumpling now as she clung to Rio. And it hurt as it always did.</p><p>“Agatha, please.”</p><p>Agatha was pressing her face into Rio’s cheek, her breath was warm and rich from the wine she’d had, and Rio wanted to drink her down until her stomach was full and she was choking on Agatha.</p><p>Drowning would be kinder than this.</p><p>Because at least there would be an end.</p><p>Wanting Agatha would be ceaseless.</p><p>“Please,” she whispered again, but Agatha didn’t pull away.</p><p>She only turned her head to press her lips against Rio’s cheek, to her ear, down to her jaw, along to her chin, then down, down, down her body, until her face was pressed in against her thigh. And Agatha was repeating Rio’s plea against her.</p><p>“Please, please, please, please…”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and found her fingers were already buried in Agatha’s hair before she could stop them, before she could even think. She rested her head back and breathed in sharply, feeling the pain ebb and flow in unrelenting waves throughout her body.</p><p>Agatha was still murmuring against her thigh, still softly begging as she clung to her, and it took everything Rio had to make herself pull away, to make herself crouch slowly before Agatha and to look into streaming blue eyes.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said slowly, forcing the three syllables into existence.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes closed, shutting Rio off from her sights as she released a shuddering breath. Rio placed her fingers cautiously on Agatha’s jaw, her thumbs joining together to press against Agatha’s lips, then sweeping away from the other to rest at the corners of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha was silent as Rio did this, her hands reaching Rio’s thighs and moving until her fingers could hook into the belt loops of her jeans again.</p><p>They were tethered now, in a way they had been before, but Rio hoped never to be again, not in the same, desperate way.</p><p>She leant in, felt Agatha do the same as her thumbs swept back to prevent their lips from touching and she sucked in a soft breath before she whispered, “I need to go, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha made a soft noise of protest and Rio gasped as Agatha parted her lips and in a half kiss that just caught her top lip, she sucked Rio’s thumbs gently into her mouth and Rio whimpered as she pulled back to watch.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s teeth scrape against the pads of then and as she released them Agatha’s lips pouted around them and Rio gasped again.</p><p>“Please don’t go,” Agatha whispered, tugging at Rio until Rio moved her hands down to her arms and Agatha was able to move closer, to release her hold and to press her face in close, but Rio turned her head slightly to avoid soft lips that were so tempting.</p><p>“Slow doesn’t mean no, Agatha. I’m exhausted. <em>You’re</em> exhausted. I want to do this right. Not just fall into each other like we did when we first started this. I want…” and Agatha was kissing her cheek, was moving to her jaw, was placing a kiss in the hollow behind Rio’s ear.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, frowning as she felt Agatha breathe her in, as her arms moved to encircle her properly and she held her tight.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha eventually breathed, though her voice was faltering, “Okay, I want it to be right too. I want… I want this forever, Rio. I want you. I want you.”</p><p>Rio turned her head back to Agatha, her heart doing somersaults in her chest.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t done, she wasn’t finished, and her lips that carried such soft words delivered them against her skin, “I love you. I love you. I love you.”</p><p>Rio nodded gently as Agatha pulled back from where she’d pressed her last kiss to Rio’s temple and she squeezed her that much closer as she murmured, “I love you too. I love you so much. I just need a day, okay? Just… just some time.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and pulled away and Rio looked at her, frowning at her fathomless sea-blue eyes.</p><p>She watched her for as long as she could until her resolve was beginning to crumble and she had to force herself to stand. She reached for Agatha as she did, held her face for a second as she gazed up at her from her knees, and then she turned and left the warm house to step into the cold night.</p><p>Her little car was parked not far up the street and Rio sat in it for a while. She thought of Agatha back in that house, with her plans for the future and her desperate answers to Rio’s desperate questions.</p><p>And as she drove home the pain she’d once harboured over Agatha’s betrayal changed and became something much darker, much worse. It transmogrified into pain <em>for</em> Agatha. For the life she’d lived, for the things she thought about herself.</p><p>The pain blinded her and made it hard for her to stick to her decision to take a day to think.</p><p>But she was home now and in the comfort of her bed she concentrated on what <em>wasn’t</em> painful: Agatha was seeking help, Agatha was leaving Ralph, Agatha wanted her.</p><p>When she’d had some time to gather herself she called her dad, despite the late hour.</p><p>She told him the truth of it. She told him Agatha’s reasoning behind doing what she’d done. She told him how hard it was to hear it. She told him how much pain Agatha had been in, how she’d fallen for her the first time she’d seen her, and how much she loved her now. She told him she was leaving Ralph, and that she wanted Rio to move in with her and Nicky. She told him there was a way forwards, that the path was there, and that they both wanted to take it. She told him they were going to speak again tomorrow, when they’d both slept and were feeling stronger. She told him that she loved her, that the pain was lessened, and that she could now picture a resolution, but that he would have to improve his joke-telling skills and her mom would have to buy enough ingredients for food enough for five for a celebratory meal when she could finally say: here she is, this is Agatha, my girlfriend.</p><p>She hung up from Miguel with a smile on her face for the first time all week.</p><p>She curled up closer in on herself, text Alice that she was okay, that she would tell her all tomorrow, and breathed out slowly as she stared at the ceiling and thought more of Agatha.</p><p>Was she asleep already? No. Of course not. But was she okay? Was she feeling hopeful? She hoped so.</p><p>She missed her already. Missed her still.</p><p>But they had time now, time to talk, time to take things slow.</p><p>Slow was okay. She could handle slow. Because slow wasn’t nothing. Slow meant that they could be together. Slow meant Rio’s heart wasn’t broken beyond repair.</p><p>Slow meant Agatha.</p><p>Slow meant Rio could sleep.</p>

<p><strong>The Chiltern Firehouse, Night Before The BAFTAs</strong></p><p>It shouldn’t feel the way it did, Agatha knew that. She knew it now when Ralph had pulled her down to place a lazy, off-kilter kiss to her unwilling mouth, she’d known the first time she’d felt his lips on her own, she’d known with every touch, and every moment since.</p><p>She’d known a very long time.</p><p>But then Rio had come along, <em>properly</em>, the woman of her fantasies made a shining, immovable reality, and she’d kissed the woman who had been on her mind since a dark and stormy night in Chicago where for the first time in her life she’d almost lost complete control. And she’d no longer had any sense at all of what it was to not want to touch someone all the time.</p><p>Her skin didn’t feel like her skin unless she was somehow connected to Rio.</p><p>Her lips weren’t her own until they were pressed against the woman with the big doe eyes and the gap-toothed grin.</p><p>And so after leaving Ralph she found Rio again and because she couldn’t help herself she wrapped her fingers around her elbow and simply held on. Rio didn’t look back for more than a second but that was okay. She was just grateful she could hold her.</p><p>When their jackets arrived she let go to help Nicky and then accepted the staff member who offered his help with her own.</p><p>With Nicky’s little hand now firmly in her own she turned to watch the disaster unfold as if in slow motion. Rio had reached the door, stepped out into the cold, and had been caught by the dazzle of the cameras.</p><p>She’d turned back and Agatha had been shocked into movement, tugging Nicky closer to her.</p><p>“Rio.” The maitre d’ moved around her and lamely tried to help what was already in motion. “Turn. Go.”</p><p>But Rio hadn’t moved and Agatha didn’t have time to waste. Nicky was the priority and she could feel him tense up as she tugged him impossibly closer and stepped around Rio with him pressed to her front. Miraculously she found Rio’s hand as she did and tried not to think of how warm it was, how good it felt to have her here for this.</p><p>Rio squeezed her and Agatha knew she was with them.</p><p>Agatha only released Rio as she helped bundle Nicky into the car and felt Rio form a sort of protective shield with her body so they could both climb in safely. She didn’t miss the soft tremble of her son as she fixed his belt across him.</p><p>“Fuck. Fuck! I forgot I…”</p><p>Agatha had managed it, managed to secure Nicky in, and adjusted his jacket gently around him with a frown. “It’s fine.” It was a lie, but it wasn’t Rio’s fault. God knows she’d done more to try and protect Nicky in the past few weeks than Ralph ever had. She flexed her jaw and then forced herself to relax it.</p><p>“It’s not. Ralph should have helped. He should have-…”. Agatha glanced at Rio for the first time since they’d entered the car and saw that same infuriating look of frustration across her features, the genuine care sewed into her brow, the concern etched into the tightness of her usually relaxed, usually grinning lips.</p><p>As Rio huffed a breath and ran her hands through her hair Agatha forced herself to relax back a little, to block out the fantasy of a band on one of those fingers.</p><p>“Sorry for the bad language kid.”</p><p>Beside her, Nicky leant across and smiled and Agatha reached for both of their hands, using them both to anchor her feelings, to try and get a grip where her mind was beginning to start its usual spiral. She pulled Rio’s hand into her lap and held it tight, taking a second to just do so before she admitted: “They can be bad in London. There’ll be more at the hotel.”</p><p>She felt Rio shift and then her other hand come to anchor her more by holding her arm. Sometimes it felt like Rio could feel her frustration, though she’d never voiced it.</p><p>“I’ll go first? Nicky can go behind me and-…”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha turned to her and found it difficult not to lean in, to not show her gratitude the way she wanted to, the way she <em>should</em> be able to. “Stop being so-…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p><em>Good. Kind. Protective. Perfect.</em></p><p>Agatha frowned and shook her head, deciding that turning away from Rio was better for everyone. Her thumb was acting against the rest of her body, apparently unable to stop from brushing over the soft skin she thought about constantly and now craved to touch, to kiss, every time she was near her.</p><p>In the silence of the car, Agatha focused on Nicky now leaning against her, on the woman against her other side holding her firm, on the hollow feeling in her chest that this wasn’t her family, that Rio was someone she could have only when no one was watching or when the lights were out.</p><p>She couldn’t kiss her in a restaurant or hold her hand down the street.</p><p>The thoughts began to spread their icy tendrils through her body until even the warmth of Rio’s hand in hers couldn’t thaw it.</p><p>When the car stopped before the hotel Agatha was the first to let go. She helped Nicky and then turned to see Rio do something that Ralph would never do and that Agatha could have cried to see.</p><p>She’d waited for Nicky to clamber over Agatha and then slid out first and helped Nicky down and body-blocked him from the front as Agatha stepped in behind. They formed a small conga line doing the saddest dance routine in the world and made slow but purposeful progress towards the warm embrace of the hotel.</p><p>Someone tried to get in Rio’s face and Agatha’s heart stopped for a brief moment before a security guard stepped in and smacked the guy away. Agatha felt Nicky tense between them and she squeezed his shoulder to let her know she was there, that <em>they</em> were there.</p><p>Stepping into the lobby, Agatha felt as if she could breathe again. She bent down immediately when they were a safe distance from the doors and adjusted Nicky’s jacket and brushed away the damp hair from his forehead from the fierce London rain. When she could no longer avoid meeting Rio’s gaze she looked up and bit on her lip, taking a second to scan Rio over for any harm done before she moved and took a light hold of her collar.</p><p>She wanted to kiss her. Now, openly, gratefully. But she settled instead for a soft, “Thank you.”</p><p>When Rio smiled Agatha looked down at it, wondered if she could get away with a quick kiss, but pulled away instead and turned to take Nicky to the elevator at the back of the space. Rio followed and Agatha briefly closed her eyes when she found her hand being taken again as the doors closed. She leant into her, because how could she not.</p><p>During the brief journey they felt like a family and the ice in Agatha’s veins began to burn.</p><p>Nicky was the first to step out and Agatha pressed her lips quickly to Rio’s cheek, thanking her in the only way she could with her son so close. She pressed in, allowed Rio’s perma-warmth to soothe her for a second before she turned to follow Nicky who was dutifully waiting for her just out of sight around the elevator.</p><p>She touched his shoulder and watched him hurry forwards in the direction of their suite.</p><p>She didn’t turn as she followed behind. How could she? If she turned she’d beg Rio to stay with them. She’d drag her inside and confuse the hell out of her young son by telling him Rio was now his dad and he’d never be seeing Ralph again.</p><p>Or, and here is where she wouldn’t often let herself go, she’d turn and tell Rio to stop following, to stop helping, to stop being so fucking perfect, and to stop making her heart hurt. In short, she’d ask her to leave and never turn back.</p><p>Nicky had stopped at the door to their suite and Agatha smiled at him as she fished in her pocked for her key. She watched as Rio kissed her son’s head, saw as Nicky cuddled in, and then felt Rio’s lips against her cheek and she had to reckon with the fact that she was leaving before Agatha had a choice in the matter.</p><p>Agatha watched her go. She felt the pain sharpen with every step that Rio took away from her until a little had tugged her back inside and Nicky in his small voice and with his big heart said: “I wish Rio could be here all the time.”</p><p>“Me too, honey.”</p><p>Agatha put Nicky to bed, read with him, even sang a soft song to soothe the worries he still had from the earlier experience with the paps and waited for twenty minutes to make sure he was asleep before leaving his side.</p><p>She traipsed back through to the living area, poured herself a glass of Rio’s favourite red wine, and collapsed onto the sofa. The richness of the wine couldn’t take the bad taste out of her mouth and all roads in her brain led to Rio Vidal, sitting alone in a hotel room when she should be here with her.</p><p><em>Coward</em> she thought, over and over. And it was because of that she wasn’t ever able to be with Rio. She could never give Nicky the family he deserved. He’d have to live with the knowledge that his mother had stayed with his useless, shitty dad.</p><p>Because of what she was. Because of what she’d been born.</p><p>Her mother would win. She would win because she was right: Agatha had been born evil. She’d been born twisted and wrong and only when she was a teenager and able to understand the things she shouldn’t feel from a friend holding her hand had she realised what her mother must have realised from the moment she’d been released from her.</p><p>And then Rio came along in all her brightness and cocksure sense of self. And Agatha had never felt so right in her life. She’d never felt the desire to be <em>good</em> more than when she looked at Rio. Because this was a different kind of good. This was the real kind. The kind that could love and be loved in return.</p><p>Loving Rio wasn’t the bad thing. It was <em>how</em> she loved Rio, how she’d allowed herself to love Rio from the day she’d met her. She’d loved her secretly. She <em>still</em> loved her secretly. And Rio deserved love that could be spoken out loud. She deserved shouted love, loud love. She deserved not to be hidden.</p><p>She deserved someone who wouldn’t hide her.</p><p>Her mother’s form of good had never been about true goodness. Her mother’s form of good was straight, white, married with 2.5 kids. It’s why she kept her from Nicky. It’s why she’d funnelled everything she could into the little boy by way of love and care and attention. And he’d grown into the child Agatha had never been allowed to be: he was shy and sweet and soft.</p><p>Nicky was good. Nicky was her joy.</p><p>And he was so like Rio. Her baby had come out with large brown eyes that didn’t match her own or her husband’s. Agatha had denied Ralph the paternity test he’d demanded and had lived separately to him for the majority of Nicky’s life, jealously protecting her joy.</p><p>But Agatha felt far from those things now, far from joy, far from her son or her love.</p><p>Rio continued to give and never ask for anything in return.</p><p>She was soft like Nicky and if Agatha knew only one thing she knew she had been put on this earth to be Nicky’s mama and to love Rio Vidal.</p><p>If only she could let herself. If only she weren’t a coward. If only she could say the words she knew Rio wanted to hear, the words that meant too much, but at the same time were as easy as breathing.</p><p>If only she could be good for her.</p><p>She drank down her wine, and, checking one last time on a sleeping Nicky, she disappeared from the suite to go and find Rio.</p><p>She knocked once on her door, looking furtively up and down the hallway to ensure she was alone. When Rio didn’t answer she tried again. This time, the door opened.</p><p>Agatha forced a smile, forced herself to look far from the terror she felt growing in her stomach, not to let on to the anger bubbling away at her.</p><p>“I don’t have long.”</p><p>Rio stepped back and Agatha followed her in and they now stood silently in the semi-darkness.</p><p>“Nicky’s asleep but he’s alone. I can’t be long.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“I don’t have long.”</p><p>Rio was reaching now and Agatha couldn’t stop herself as she reached for her before she could even make contact. Her hand curled around that familiar, grabbable waist. She gasped, and Rio gasped with her as she pressed their bodies together and for the first time in weeks Agatha felt whole again.</p><p>But she hesitated. She panicked. She still felt so angry, still so frustrated with herself. And even as Rio pressed her into the door, even as she pressed her lips to her, Agatha wanted to scream.</p><p>But she opened her mouth, allowed Rio in. She used her teeth and tongue to get more of her, to taste and taste and taste, to think of only Rio, only ever Rio. She soon couldn’t breathe but she still wanted more, still needed Rio’s taste on her tongue, and she nipped at a plump lower lip, savouring the moan it conjured.</p><p>And then Rio was pulling back, was kissing her jaw, her throat, was moving to tug at her sweater.</p><p>“I don’t have long.”</p><p>Inside she was a furnace and Rio, good, loving Rio, was unknowingly fuelling her fires of hatred as the self-loathing embers flickered and roared into life.</p><p>But she was moving still, kissing her way down Agatha’s body until she could push her sweater up and kiss the belly that had once cradled the child she believed was Rio’s, the child she wholeheartedly wanted to be Rio’s.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, gasping softly as Rio worshipped her stomach with her lips and tongue. She felt desperate, but for what, she didn’t know. She still wanted to scream, still wanted to rage, still wanted… she met Rio’s gaze, molten caramel in the dim light.</p><p>She wanted Rio.</p><p>She watched as Rio began to scramble at the zipper of her jeans, and she made a noise she didn’t mean to make, because she didn’t have time. She wasn’t in the right mindset to allow Rio to do what she was about to.</p><p>“I don’t have-…”</p><p>The button came loose with a rough yank of Rio’s long fingers and Agatha almost choked on her hesitance. She watched as Rio ripped her jeans from her hips and pulled them down her thighs.</p><p>Her hands were on her now, warm and firm as they held her and she watched as Rio stared straight ahead, making Agatha wet with just a look.</p><p>Rio slipped her fingers into the fabric of her panties and Agatha lost the will and resorted instead to begging: “Rio, baby…”</p><p>Rio gasped quietly at her name and, soft as a sigh, she asked, “Can I… can I have a picture of you in these?”</p><p>Agatha felt her cunt clench around nothing. She felt the slick of her pussy weep more and the fury in her chest burned brighter than it had all night. She took in a sharp breath and watched Rio still, her mind now alive in its self-possession. She wanted to rage against herself. She wanted to damn herself to hell for not being good enough, for not deserving this acolyte before her.</p><p>She bit her lip and ran her fingers delicately through Rio’s hair, forcing herself to be soft, forcing the fury inwards still.</p><p>“Yes,” she managed out, “if you hurry.”</p><p>She watched as Rio smirked, as she used her teeth to pull her underwear down, and once they were at her ankles she gasped quietly. Because Rio had looked back up, and she looked hungrier than even before. Her pussy clenched again and Agatha almost lost it, almost shot her fury outwards.</p><p>Her hips rolled into nothing, desperate for Rio to touch her, to be inside her, to fuck her.</p><p>And then her tongue made contact and Agatha heard Rio moan as she rolled her head back and dug her nails into Rio’s scalp.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>She wanted this forever. She wanted Rio on her knees for her, with her tongue ready and willing for her whenever she wanted it; and she’d want it all the time. She needed Rio to follow her around, to be ready to fuck her whenever she asked. She needed this woman more than she could comprehend.</p><p>And then she lost her mind.</p><p>She gripped harder, tighter, and began to take.</p><p>Rio had done this before. Rio had been on her knees for other women. Rio had tasted other women. Rio had had her tongue inside them. Rio would do it again.</p><p>Because Agatha couldn’t give her what she wanted.</p><p>Because she was too old, had a kid, was a coward.</p><p>But Rio was hers now. She could take, for at least what it took to make her come. And god bless Rio’s mouth, in being so excellent it dulled her fears, made her body take over and her mind numb.</p><p>She cried out when she came, trying her best to contain it. But it was so good, so delicious, so needed, that she barely could.</p><p>She slowed her movements down, gradually at first, and then released her hold on Rio and found her willing still, obligingly lapping at her still with her talented tongue until a flash of anger shot through her and she took it out on Rio without meaning to, and pulled her head back from her.</p><p>She looked down and saw before her a look of complete and utter submission. Rio’s face was covered in her. Her lips were swollen, her cheeks flushed a deep crimson.</p><p>Agatha turned away, she had to, she couldn’t bear to look at what she’d done. What she’d just allowed Rio to do.</p><p>But Rio was whining, and Agatha stooped down to pull up her underwear again, to raise her jeans back up too.</p><p>“Agatha. Hey, just stay. Just give me five more minutes.”</p><p>How had she allowed this? How had she allowed herself to walk over here and take from Rio?</p><p>That’s all she did.</p><p>Take, take, take.</p><p>Rio was still kneeling but Agatha didn’t look anymore as she zipped up her jeans and, after pausing for barely a second, she stumbled her way out of the door.</p><p>In the hall Agatha took a deep breath. She could smell herself. She could smell what Rio had done to her. And all she could think was what <em>she’d</em> done to Rio, how long she’d let this go on, how she’d allowed Nicky to fall in love with her too, how crushed he would be when she broke Rio’s heart the day Rio realised Agatha was no good, that she was evil, that she always had been, that she’d been born that way.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Rio’s voice shocked her into turning slightly. It was soft, like everything Rio did.</p><p>And she turned to it, because how could she not?</p><p>She knocked on the door and took in a shaking breath as it opened for her again, like she knew it would.</p><p>Agatha swallowed thickly, felt the soft touch of Rio on her calves, and reached down to brush her thumb tenderly along Rio’s jaw.</p><p>She had to hear it.</p><p>Just once.</p><p>Once and then she would leave Rio.</p><p>She’d leave her because it was the right thing to do.</p><p>Because being with her was selfish, it was cruel.</p><p>And Agatha didn’t want to be cruel to Rio.</p><p>She loved her. <em>My god</em>, did she love her.</p><p>But her mind wasn’t her own anymore, she’d sunk back into her trauma and fears and like an abused child she asked for the wrong thing to make herself feel better.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Rio frowned up at her and clutched her a little tighter as Agatha continued to caress her jaw.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>“Tell you what?”</p><p>A heavy breath, and then: “tell me what you tried to tell me in Boston. If you still feel it… tell me.”</p><p>She needed it desperately. Her one chance, her one chance of ever hearing it from such perfect lips, from such a perfect woman. Because she’d never hear it again, not when Rio realised how cowardly she was, how twisted and broken she was.</p><p>And then Rio said it, plainly, easily, as if Agatha hadn’t asked for anything hard or complicated.</p><p>Agatha realised then just how bad she truly was. Her mother had been right all along. She didn’t deserve the goodness she’d been siphoning out of Rio. She didn’t deserve her care or her tenderness.</p><p>She didn’t deserve her love.</p><p>“I love you. I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Agatha sucked it in, let the words disseminate in her body, filtering down to her ungrateful heart. She closed her eyes and felt Rio lean up, and try to tug at her, whispering her name, and making Agatha gasp in shock at the sudden pain of it all.</p><p>But she deserved it.</p><p>She deserved the pain that came from making Rio love her, making her say it.</p><p>She was still holding Rio, her left hand still curled softly around Rio’s chin, her other moving to hold Rio’s arm, just to anchor herself. Just to feel something that wasn’t this exquisite hurt that thrummed from deep in her bones.</p><p>“I need to get back,” she managed to get out, dropping her hands and blinking shamefully down at the woman still on her knees for her.</p><p>“Just stay a little longer.”</p><p>“Nicky’s alone. I need to get back to him.”</p><p>Rio was nodding and Agatha flexed her jaw as she turned to leave but she stopped when she heard Rio again: “It hurts. It hurts to see you with Ralph. To not be able to-… it hurts.”</p><p>Agatha turned to look and felt the sting of it all again, felt the desire once more to scream, to rage, to throw herself into things just to feel the physical hurt of it.</p><p>Punishment.</p><p>She needed punishment.</p><p>But Rio was pulling her down now and Agatha couldn’t find it in herself to stop her. She was pulled into her lap and Agatha’s hands moved of their own accord to Rio’s hair, and there they remained, softer than before, <em>purposefully</em> softer than before.</p><p>This had to be it.</p><p>She had to end it. She had to let Rio go.</p><p>But her body wouldn’t let her, at least, not yet.</p><p>She wrapped herself around Rio, watched the subtle movements of her face, brushed her thumbs carefully over her skin.</p><p>The woman she’d loved for all these years, had given herself completely to her, and yet… and yet… she couldn’t give herself back.</p><p>A tear fell from her eyes and Rio reached to take it but she couldn’t allow it anymore. She had to stop the softness. So she pulled back, undeserving.</p><p>She stood and stumbled as she did.</p><p>“I need to go.”</p><p>She didn’t look back around as she left.</p><p>On the journey back to her room she let her anger grow. She let it grow until it consumed her and punishment was all she could think about. She needed to purge herself of the voice that sounded a lot like Rio’s that told her she <em>could</em> be good enough, that she <em>was</em> good enough.</p><p>Because she knew she wasn’t. She never would be.</p><p>When she managed to get back to her suite she went straight to check in on her son.</p><p>Nicky was tucked up comfortably where she left him, his fist thrown above his head, his hair splayed out behind him on the pillow, his lashes fluttering with the cadence of his dreams. He was precious, untouched by the bad Agatha had inside of her. And as she watched him she hoped something Lilia had said to her long ago were true: that children are made from love above all else.</p><p>And the only person she loved other than her son was the woman she’d just left on her knees in the dark.</p><p>How long she stood in the door watching Nicky she didn’t know, but the spell of peace was broken when a firm smack jerked her to her senses and she turned around into Ralph’s grinning form. His large hands were behind her and grabbing the ass he’d just smacked. He smelt like whisky and wine and Agatha tried not to recoil when she felt the press of him against her thigh.</p><p>Everything with Ralph was aggressive even when he was being slow, and she grimaced when he slurred down at her, “trying to romance you, Agatha. Can’t a husband expect romance once in a while?”</p><p>He leant in and the stink of his breath became almost overwhelming and Agatha would have pushed him away, she would have called him a pig and marched off to her room but she wanted to try, to try once more to be the woman she’d been before Rio had shown her a way out.</p><p>She wanted to hide again.</p><p>So she hid.</p><p>She hid in the punishment that would be sleeping with her husband.</p><p>She hid in Ralph’s mouth, with his aggressive tongue, she hid in his too-large hands that groped as they stumbled together to Ralph’s bedroom. Nothing felt right, nothing felt good.</p><p>But hiding was good. Hiding would keep her and Nicky safe. Safe from heartache and safe from longing.</p><p>She was on top of Ralph now, had angled her body away from his erect penis, unwilling to be near it for longer than absolutely necessary. But Ralph was insistent, as always, he rolled them over and landed on her hair but didn’t apologise for it.</p><p>She strained beneath him, trying to remain silent with Nicky just at the other side of the suite. She suddenly wanted this done, this whole thing to be over. But the word ‘no’ died in her throat as Ralph’s wet mouth hit her now bare abdomen.</p><p>He was so close to where Rio had just been, so grossly different, that it shocked Agatha back into her body. It made her strain and tug until Ralph was back up over her and his tongue was attacking her mouth.</p><p>She reached down between them and fumbled with his belt and then his zipper and then, when his boxers and pants had been hurriedly thrust down his thighs, he began to thrust against her, uncaring about her expensive jeans that would now have to be incinerated for being tainted so.</p><p>“Condom,” she managed to insist, “Ralph.”</p><p>He grunted and threw himself from her and left alone on the bed Agatha stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>She deserved this. She had to take it. This was the life she’d chosen. The one where Rio loving her was a fantasy. One she had to free Rio from.</p><p>So when Ralph came back, she didn’t say no.</p><p>In her frenzy she managed to get her hips up, to push her pants down, and Ralph didn’t wait much longer than that.</p><p>It hurt. It always, always hurt.</p><p>Even how ready she’d been for Rio, how desperately she’d have taken anything she would give her, with Ralph she couldn’t relax. It was like her body just outright refused him, denied him, <em>hated</em> him.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>His hot breath was against her cheek, one of his hands back where it tugged at her hair on the pillow, and he continued to thrust, heavy, desperate jabs inside of her. The discomfort was familiar and therefore <em>almost</em> comfortable.</p><p>But the last time she’d had sex with Ralph, well over a year ago now, she’d had nothing to compare it to, it had just been something she’d done every so often, as infrequent as she could make it, just to shut him up, just to uphold the name of ‘wife’.</p><p>But now Rio had touched her. Rio had shown her what desire was. She’d set a fire alight in her that burned even when she wasn’t around because Agatha was always thinking of her, and therefore <em>always</em> desiring her.</p><p>Ralph grunted and Agatha couldn’t hold back her grimace. She just lay still, allowed it to happen, thought of Rio and how she’d left her. Thought of the way she’d looked up at her with those big eyes she sometimes lost herself in. The eyes that she wanted to drown herself in.</p><p>But Ralph was still moving on top of her, and Agatha realised that the man who took a while to come would take even longer because he was drunk. He was grunting with every thrust, his large body fit but inflexible, every movement was like trying to pilot a barge into a marina.</p><p>Ralph adjusted and yanked at her hair and though it was accidental Agatha grit her teeth and pulled her head aside. She managed to free her hair before she settled back.</p><p>Ralph was grunting more now, making deep noises of exertion or maybe pleasure - Agatha had never cared enough to figure it out. But he was getting louder and Nicky was close so Agatha spoke for the second time since she’d left Rio.</p><p>“Shut up. Nicky’s here. Shut. Up.”</p><p>She slapped his shoulder to get his attention and Ralph cursed as he stopped, “Kiss me. Be my wife. Kiss me.”</p><p>He was hot above her. He was sweaty in a clammy way. He stank of the alcohol he’d consumed and the cologne he doused himself in everyday. He was everything Rio wasn’t. Rio was warm rather than hot. If she was ever sweaty it was sticky and enticing rather than damp and slimy. She always smelled vaguely of bergamot, rose, patchouli from her perfume. Agatha could still smell her on the shirt she’d stolen from her and she thought of it now, hidden under her pillow in the next room.</p><p>And Rio was sensitive to what Agatha needed, willing to give her anything even before she asked for it.</p><p>The fury that had fired in her chest before fired again, fired so bright she couldn’t see, all she could feel was the badness she’d been born with.</p><p>So she kissed her husband. But it was more an attack than an actual kiss. She attacked him with a ferocity that had their teeth clashing and her hands tugging so aggressively at his hair that his hips stuttered.</p><p>She <em>hated</em> him. <em>Hated</em> him being above her, <em>inside</em> her. <em>Hated</em> that she’d allowed it. That she was married to him.</p><p>Because Ralph had a response from Agatha, for the first time since one time almost eight years ago, Agatha had done more than just lie there, Ralph came faster than usual. Though he’d still taken his time. He came with a groan into Agatha’s open mouth, and Agatha could have cried for the protective latex barrier that stopped him spilling himself inside of her.</p><p>Thank god she’d stopped him before he’d put one on. Thank god she’d insisted. Thank god. Thank god. Thank god.</p><p>Ralph went limp above her but hadn’t had the decency to pull out.</p><p>Agatha started to slap him, turning her face completely away from his large head now buried in her hair. He pulled away, manoeuvring his large form away from her until he collapsed onto his back beside her, once again landing in her hair.</p><p>She rolled over and freed herself and silently left the room after tugging her underwear and pants up. She was sore between her thighs and aching all over, but she moved with the speed of a woman with no aches either of body or heart.</p><p>She went through to check on Nicky. He was asleep in the same position as before, his mouth now open as he dreamt.</p><p>She closed his door again, softly, as quietly as she could.</p><p>After that, she went to shower and turned the dial on the temperature all the way down, then up, then down, then up again, and so on and on and on until she physically couldn’t take it anymore. She wanted to purge her body of the feel of Ralph and found that wasn’t difficult.</p><p>What was more difficult, what was impossible, was ridding herself of Rio’s touch.</p><p>Neither the shock of cold nor the scald of hot could help her to rid it from her skin. Every inch of her that Rio had ever touched, ever caressed, ever worshipped, now belonged to the woman she’d left in the dark.</p><p>Rio Vidal had somehow tattooed herself all over Agatha’s body.</p><p>But more than that, she was woven into the material of her soul. And knowing that now, knowing that she’d done the bad thing, <em>the worst thing</em>, there was nothing to do but collapse onto the floor of the shower.</p><p>Her knees hit the hard tile harder than she meant them to. The pain ricocheted through her body, sending waves of agony through her that piled up until her eyes streamed and her head hung low.</p><p>She placed her fingertips shoulder width apart on the wall and kept her head down. It was quiet now, almost silent in the en-suite bathroom connected to her room. The only sound was her shallow breathing and the steady drip, drip of the water from her hair into the shallow pool around her knees.</p><p>It hurt. Everything hurt.</p><p>Rio was a good thing, a solid thing, a <em>perfect</em> thing.</p><p>Agatha had met her once, fallen in love, and then built her up in her head so much that the <em>real</em> Rio Vidal couldn’t possibly compete. And then it turned out she did. She was everything Agatha had fantasied she would be, everything she’d dreamed she’d be, but more than that.</p><p>Because in none of Agatha’s fantasises or dreams had she allowed herself to imagine that Rio might love her, might be <em>in love</em> with her. The magic woman she’d met in the bathroom eight years ago in her fantasies was into her, was willing for her, maybe cared for her, but never loved her.</p><p>Love from a woman like Rio was something she hadn’t believed she could ever expect.</p><p>Only Rio, the real Rio, she gave it so easily. She was always warm, always happy to see her, always so <em>good</em>. And all Agatha did was take. She siphoned all that goodness, all that <em>love</em> out of her. Unable, or unwilling, to give it back. Because she was a coward.</p><p>And now she’d done the most cowardly thing she could think to do. She’d run back to the arms of the husband she hated because being with him was easier than the vulnerability of opening herself up to Rio, of telling her everything she felt.</p><p>Every second of every day was laced with the love she had for her.</p><p>She saw it in her son as he grinned his big-toothed grin at her.</p><p>She saw it in the sight of her own hands, the hands that didn’t touch anyone with any care or tenderness unless it were Rio, or her son.</p><p>She saw it in the way Rio looked at her.</p><p>She’d punished herself in the worst way possible.</p><p>Because only now did she realise, did she <em>understand</em> that losing Rio was the one true punishment. The one she couldn’t bear.</p><p>Rio was all she wanted. Just Rio. Just good, perfect, Rio.</p><p>In the solace of the bathroom, dripping wet and shivering, Agatha Harkness made a choice; she chose Rio. She chose the fear that Rio might never forgive her for what she’d done. She chose that one day, Rio might turn to her and tell her she was too much, or not enough. She chose to be left desolate and broken if Rio ever left her.</p><p>Only now she feared it was much too late.</p><p>Rio would never forgive her for what she’d done and Agatha would never forgive herself.</p><p>But she chose to be brave. She had to call her lawyer. She had to tell Rio.</p>

<p>“Rio.”</p><p>A gentle hand shook the sleeping woman, tentative at first, then gradually growing in insistence.</p><p>“Babe. You gotta wake up for me.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, too tired to realise that she’d gone to bed alone so waking up to someone in her room should have been a surprise. She slapped at the hand that shook her, tugged at her blankets, kept her eyes closed.</p><p>Her body had been ravaged, her mind still trying to soothe itself down from the intensity of the talk she’d had with Agatha only hours before.</p><p>“Despierta. Por favor.” <em>Wake up. Please.</em></p><p>Rio screwed her eyes tighter shut, scowling as she began to slowly wake, the shaking not abating and the Spanish alerting something in her brain that English could not.</p><p>“Rio, it’s your dad. Please.”</p><p>And Rio’s eyes opened only to find something she wished she could unsee. Because she’d never seen that look before on Alice’s face but she knew immediately what it meant.</p><p>“No,” she said more firmly than she expected to. And Alice didn’t flinch, didn’t pull back from her, just continued to watch her with that same stricken expression.</p><p>“No, don’t. Not-…”</p><p>“Rio, he died about an hour ago.”</p><p>Miguel Vidal had died four hours after he’d hung up from his daughter. He’d crawled back into bed with a smile on his face and told his wife that Rio was to be okay. And if he weren’t mistaken, that they would someday soon have a daughter-in-law and a grandson.</p><p>He’d died at peace.</p><p>Rio Elena Vidal had been born in the spring, the miracle baby to a couple who desperately wanted her. She’d been brought up knowing she was loved and in knowing that, she’d had endless confidence as she was sent out into the world to become her own woman.</p><p>Even in her teens she was close to her parents. When she shouted at her mom she would return to her, crying and sorry for what she’d said. When she was short with her dad, she’d apologise within minutes for upsetting him.</p><p>And they, equally, couldn’t be mad long at her.</p><p>Anna Vidal was careful, discerning, a perfect wife and a perfect mother. Miguel Vidal was less careful, more joyous, and louder in his happiness. And that was just it, they were happy.</p><p>They loved each other no more or no less than any other happy family.</p><p>The Vidals weren’t special but they were lucky; not every family is a happy one.</p><p>And so just as they had all once been happy, Rio Elena Vidal was now broken.</p><p>She’d called her mom after crying in Alice’s arms and found out that her dad had died peacefully in his sleep of a suspected heart attack. It was a cruel trick from a cruel universe to take the man who loved so well by making the very engine of his greatest gift the very thing that took him from those he so generously bestowed it upon.</p><p>She took the first flight she could get to Delaware with her manager who’d packed for her as Rio threw on some clothes and tried to make her body move even when she felt she couldn’t.</p><p>Alice made calls to the studio to tell them Rio wouldn’t be showing up to work. They were generous in their response: they gave her three days.</p><p>Rio hadn’t responded to this news at all and Alice hadn’t tried to make any conversation other than to comment on the gate they were to wait at or the fact that she’d arranged a car to take them straight to her mom’s house when they landed.</p><p>No paparazzi found them. Fans who spotted Rio were respectful enough to see a mourning woman when they saw one so stayed away.</p><p>All Rio could think about was her mom all alone in the little house discovering her dad, being alone when she’d called the ambulance, being alone when she’d tried to call Rio and alone when she had to contact Alice instead.</p><p>Because that was devastating, but thoughts of her father being gone were simply unbearable.</p><p>It took a little over seven hours all in to get to her childhood home: a neat little four bed, two bath. And when she was there she saw the cars of the people she knew to be her aunts and cousins. Her mom at least wasn’t alone now.</p><p>When she stepped over the threshold she smelt cooking, heard the familiar sounds of her family squawking and squabbling and the confusing jibberish that was produced when native Spanish speakers spoke to native English speakers.</p><p>Her littlest cousin able to walk was the first to greet her - a little girl of two whom she lifted and cuddled close as she walked further in to find her mom.</p><p>Hands found her, soft whispers in Spanish were graced upon her, but she held it together until she found the woman who shared her grief. Anna Vidal was where she expected her to be. She was by the stove, her eyes on whatever was bubbling away in the pan, her face pale, tired, and drawn.</p><p>“Mamá?”</p><p>Rio placed her cousin down as her mom turned to her and Anna Vidal for the first time that day began to sob. Rio gathered her mother in her arms and held her through it, unable to contain her own tears as she cried for a loss too great to bear alone.</p><p>The two women by the stove were soon piled upon by other soothing hands and Rio and Anna were carried through the next three days with the steadfast comfort of their family. They were neither left alone for longer than five minutes, neither allowed to do more than they wanted to, and neither left without a hand holding their own.</p><p>Rio remained in her childhood home until she had to leave. Alice had booked her the latest possible flight back to Los Angeles and held her hand all the way home.</p><p>Alice held her hand in bed that night and in the car to set the next morning and she only released it when, at Rio’s request, she left her at the door to the hair and makeup trailer to enter alone.</p><p>The bright lights and the soft music reminded Rio of a time when she had been happy. A time when she would sing along to make her hair stylist laugh, a time when her dad was alive.</p><p>But her reminiscing lasted only in the seconds it took for hands to be on her from seemingly all directions. The make up and hair styling team all downed tools and abandoned their charges to get to her. And Rio was held together by expert hands as she swallowed down her tears and said: “Really, guys. Did you miss me that much?”</p><p>But the joke didn’t really land. Lips and hands found her cheeks and Rio allowed the soft murmurings of whispered condolences to wash over her as she was directed to her seat at the end of the trailer.</p><p>But someone was in the way of that.</p><p>Agatha was there, stood tall amongst the others, her blue eyes shining and bright where Rio’s brown ones felt dull and lifeless.</p><p>It would have been so easy to fall into her. It would have been so easy to give herself to Agatha, to ask her to carry her, to carry the pain of it. But she couldn’t do that. Giving herself over to her would mean admitting it, letting the world know exactly how broken Rio Vidal now was.</p><p>So she stepped around her, she allowed her middle and forefingers to graze the soft skin of Agatha’s left wrist, and then she pulled away and took her usual seat with Brett hovering behind her.</p><p>Through the mirror she looked up to Agatha and saw that she looked so hurt by her avoidance but she forced a small smile, she nodded once, and she took her seat back just feet from Rio.</p><p>Th past few days with her mom, Rio had been neck deep in funeral arrangements, in making sure her mom was comfortable with her paying for everything, was comfortable with Rio having to leave again before the weekend, was comfortable in the house where her husband had died.</p><p>She’d been surrounded by people constantly. She’d been in enveloped in the arms of her family and yet she’d only wanted one person throughout it all.</p><p>Alice had told her every day how often Agatha had called.</p><p><em>“Every hour, Rio.” / “Five times this morning, six this afternoon.” / “Rio, she’s not stopping, please can you take her call.”</em></p><p>But Rio could never face it.</p><p>She wanted Agatha there through it all but she’d been unable to have her. She couldn’t explain it to herself. Perhaps it was simply that the last conversation she’d had with her dad had been about her hopes for the future; how she’d hoped Agatha would be a big part of it, her <em>whole</em> future.</p><p>And now he was gone, and the shred of hope she’d had for her and Agatha had disappeared with him.</p><p>Brett tried his best with her. He spoke and laughed and joked but eventually he went silent. Rio just stared straight ahead. She just stared into her own eyes and willed the time to go faster so she didn’t have to be around so many people, so she didn’t have to be seen by them.</p><p>Good old Brett must have known she needed that too because he was quick with his work. Rio was done within an hour. Her face had been painted to not look so pale and her hair had been teased to give it life where it had been hanging limply before.</p><p>She thanked him quietly, accepted the hug he gave her, and then she made strides to leave. Only, she’d been held back. Agatha had held her back. Agatha had turned in her seat and taken hold of her arm as she’d tried to step past.</p><p>“Lamento much tu pérdida.” <em>I am so sorry for your loss.</em></p><p>Rio could only stop, could only look at her for a second before she had to turn, she had to leave. She left the trailer and went straight to costume where Frankie and Stevie had already been warned by Alice to not try.</p><p>They hugged her silently, dressed her the same, and let her go without gushing to her about how horrid they felt for her. It was better that way, it made it easier to get through the day.</p><p>Rio arrived on set early, she took her sides and went to read them quietly in the corner whilst she waited on everyone else. She hadn’t learnt her lines. She didn’t know what scene they were running.</p><p>She just knew she had to be there, rather than in Delaware.</p><p>Alice soon found her again and quietly handed her a coffee, quietly held her hand until she was called to shoot. Agatha was in the scene, a kitchen setting, a scene where Rio really just had to smile, had to react rather than act, and at one point had to drape herself around Agatha from where she would be perched on the countertop.</p><p>They ran through shots, checked marks, waited for lighting and camera to be ready, for last minute touch ups, and then Rio took her spot. She watched as Agatha took hers too, watched as she looked up at her just before Maria called for action, and felt the soft pull of blue eyes across the small set.</p><p>“Action!”</p><p>Rio let it happen around her, she straightened her back, drank her coffee, leaned with the nonchalance of a happily married woman who had a father who wasn’t dead.</p><p>The actors moved around, said their lines, and Rio reacted where she had to, moving for the first time properly only when Agatha was in front of her, when she had to cup her cheek and grin at her faux-pouting face and say: “So bossy, my love.”</p><p>Agatha, as Kate, rolled her eyes and then turned and slumped back between Rio’s legs as she remained on the corner counter.</p><p>Rio dropped her arm about Agatha, holding her over her chest as Agatha’s hands held her arm. It was a move Rio had had to discuss alone with Pepper, one she hadn’t much thought about at the time. But now it was the most intimate she’d been with Agatha since the before times. Since before Miguel had left her.</p><p>And it hurt like hell.</p><p>Agatha was drawing soft patterns on her forearm that Rio just knew weren’t character-driven. They were for her, and her alone. And Rio rested the side of her jaw against Agatha’s head as the scene went on, as Agatha acted with the others and Rio just had to be there, just had to play the role of ‘wife’.</p><p>When “cut” was called and Maria came in with notes for Billy, Agatha turned slowly in her hold and the hands that had once been on her arm were now settled behind Rio as Agatha loosely held her around her middle.</p><p>“Are you okay? I’ve been trying to-…”</p><p>“I know, I-… I couldn’t. I just couldn’t.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said quietly, nodding as Rio closed her eyes and tried to not let the tears break free. “Rio, is there anything-…?”</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Maria’s voice cut through the moment and Rio opened her eyes in time to see Agatha turn around and look at Maria. She felt Agatha become stiff against her, felt her now suddenly so different to the Agatha who had just been gazing up at her.</p><p>But then she was turning back, then she was soft again and she asked, “I’ll be one sec, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, watched Agatha leave her, and closed her eyes again.</p><p>She had a job to do, two days to get through, and then she could be home again. Then she could be with her mom and her cousins. Then she could mourn properly.</p><p>Agatha was back before she knew it, and she only knew it because her arms were around her again and Agatha was whispering, “I’m here. I’m back.”</p><p>Rio sighed as she placed her hands gently on Agatha’s arms and in the firmest voice she could muster she said: “Please don’t. I need to get through this, Agatha. Just two days and then… If I fall into you I won’t be able to-…”</p><p>She didn’t finish. But Agatha didn’t need her too.</p><p>She nodded, she looked devastated, but then she turned around again.</p><p>Agatha didn’t try to talk to her again after that. Her fingers, whenever they could, found their way back to her in the scene. But she remained what Rio could only describe as professional, but not detached.</p><p>It was as if she were giving Rio exactly what she’d just asked for but letting her know she was there still in the soft patterns against her skin, in the hovering close even when she had moved away to talk to Maria.</p><p>In a pause between filming Lilia had tried to move over but Agatha had intercepted. Rio caught the look in Lilia’s dark gaze as Agatha physically moved between them and she knew Lilia knew what Agatha had done for her.</p><p>Agatha became a guard dog and a soft place to land all in one.</p><p>Everyone else left Rio alone and Rio wondered if Alice had been spreading the not-so-subtle word too. Even Jen kept her distance until after the call was made for Rio to be able to leave for an early lunch and as she stepped off set with Alice she heard a quiet voice calling her name.</p><p>“Hey, I wanted to say, just how sorry I am. I know, I mean, I only met him briefly but… Agatha always spoke so highly of him.”</p><p>Rio could only nod, her body and brain now too numb to it to even feel the sting of her dad and Agatha being mentioned in one sentence.</p><p>She managed a smile in Jen’s direction and then left with Alice.</p><p>“Just this afternoon, then tomorrow,” Alice reminded quietly, holding Rio’s arm all the way back to her trailer. “Flight’s at eight tomorrow night.”</p><p>Rio said nothing as she stripped from her costume in the middle of the living space, left Alice to hang it up, and then went to crawl into her bed. She curled in on herself, and simply stared at the wall ahead of her.</p><p>Alice would come fetch her when she was needed but until then, Rio could just wallow. She could just think of her dad and everything he’d done for her over the years. She thought of his booming laugh that came out only when it was her who’d told a joke. She thought of his rough hands and how they always squeezed her hand whenever she needed it, before she needed it, when she was nervous or frightened, or worried.</p><p>She thought of his wink. Of his ancient polo shirts that had lasted through all the years of her life but that he wore as if they were new and expensive.</p><p>She thought of how he loved her mom, how he loved her, and then… outside the room she heard a door being knocked, she heard voices, she heard Agatha.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice, shaky and unsure, sounded through the closed bedroom door. “Honey. I… can I come in? Please?”</p><p>Rio sat slowly, rising from where she’d been curled on her side in the bed. Her fingers clutched the thin sheets and she stared at the barrier that hid her from Agatha’s view.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha’s voice came again, a slow, sorrowful plea that went unanswered by Rio.</p><p>Because she couldn’t answer it. She had to get through this day. Had to finish it without breaking down. And if she allowed Agatha anywhere near her when the cameras weren’t on she’d collapse.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio heard Alice’s voice on the other side, “She just needs to be alone.”</p><p>There was a soft noise against the door and Rio wondered if Agatha had placed her hand on it more violently than she meant to, but the reality was she’d rested her forehead against it, unable to leave just yet.</p><p>“Por favor, Rio?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her knees as she listening to Alice ushering Agatha out the trailer.</p><p>There was silence for a while and she almost let herself believe that Agatha had let herself be pulled away and then: “Estoy aquí. Siempre estoy aquí si me necesitas.” <em>I’m here. I’m always here if you need me.</em></p><p>Rio raised her hand up to her mouth to muffle the sob that escaped as Alice won the war and she heard the sound of Agatha being led out of the trailer and the door close behind her.</p><p>Rio sobbed silently where she sat, for her dad, for the woman who was trying but that she couldn’t allow to hold her.</p><p>And then, half an hour later, she had to have her makeup and hair redone, she was back on set, she was doing her job.</p><p>Agatha was true to Rio’s request. She didn’t approach again.</p><p>Rio was in the background of scenes, doing things in the kitchen or lounging on the sofa. It didn’t help with her thoughts. But it helped that she didn’t have to be near Agatha.</p><p>She knew now if she touched her she’d crumble. She was far from the woman who had promised her not days ago that she was strong enough to carry her and her son.</p><p>Rio could barely hold herself up.</p><p>The next day Alice had managed to get her out of needing to be on set. It was Friday, the day before the funeral, and so they’d taken the early morning flight back to Delaware instead of the one late in the evening.</p><p>Rio had spent the day with her mom, walking through everything with her, quietly holding her hand when her usually strong and fiercely independent mom needed her to - which, now, was all the time.</p><p>Rio had barely slept during this time, kept alive only through coffee and the small cookies Alice kept slipping her whenever she looked or felt particularly weak. By the time Saturday rolled around Rio held never felt worse in her life.</p><p>The night before, her father had been laid out in an open casket but Rio had refused to see him. It had caused an argument in the Vidal family home, the likes of which it hadn’t ever seen before. But Rio held firm, held true to her belief that no good would come from her seeing her beloved papá like that.</p><p>She’d crawled into the guest bed with her mom that night and apologised for the fight they’d had. Anna hadn’t been able to sleep in her own bed, given what had happened in the early hours of Monday morning.</p><p>It was the first time she’d slept properly, but her mother’s soft apology back, the gentle feel of her hand on her side as she lay beside her, it all helped. It didn’t heal, though, nothing did.</p><p>On Saturday morning Rio dressed in a plain black a-line dress. Alice helped her with her hair, which, short as it was, now had a bit of bounce to it thanks to a miracle brush gifted to her years ago by her stylist and Alice’s patience with the hairspray.</p><p>She just about managed to endure putting on makeup and a crimson lip, slip on heels, and just before she was about to step from the room Alice had called her back and held up a little bag. “I bought some of your jewellery. Finishing touch?”</p><p>Rio acquiesced and stepped closer, allowing Alice to adorn her fingers with a couple rings and put some earrings into the four holes empty in her two ears. But the final piece, the final piece Rio stopped her on. Alice had brought from home the emerald necklace Agatha had bought Rio for Christmas and it took Rio a second of just staring at it before she silently nodded and let Alice drape it around her neck.</p><p>She glanced at herself in the mirror then, touching the green jewel reverently before she made her way down the stairs to wrap herself in her warm jacket before she was ushered out to the black car awaiting her and her mom.</p><p>They drove in silence, both clutching each other’s hands, both staring straight ahead. If Miguel had been there he’d have found a story to tell to break the tension. But he wasn’t, so the tension endured.</p><p>The funeral procession took them to their parish church in downtown Wilmington: St. Paul’s. Rio had grown up in this church, she’d whispered between the pews, hidden behind the tall white columns that lined the long nave, and climbed up to the bell tower to look out over her city.</p><p>The priest greeted them as Rio’s eyes followed the coffin as it was hoisted by her uncles and male cousins from the hearse. She heard the condolences but couldn’t respond properly as she stared at the wooden box she’d bought for her dad.</p><p>Anna ushered her inside, held her hand in the narthex, and softly whispered to her daughter: “Mi querido, tu papá está aquí contigo. Está aquí con nosotros. De acuerdo?” <em>My precious, your dad is here with you. He is here with us. Okay?</em></p><p>Rio kissed her mom’s cheek and wiped the lipstick she’d left there but had no time to say anything else because the priest was back, the organ was sounding, and they walked in through the double oak doors to the church of Rio’s childhood memory.</p><p>She closed her eyes for the first few steps, relied on her mom to guide her for the journey, as she had done so well through her life. The incense and the rousing sound of “Abide With Me” sang in Spanish hit her and filled her with such unnameable nostalgia that she felt the first tear fall before she was even halfway down the aisle.</p><p>But they made it to the top and with a lowered head she saw her father’s coffin being presented before the altar.</p><p>Rio didn’t take her eyes off of it for the entirety of the Mass. Even as she stood with her cousin Mateo for the readings and held his hand as she bowed to the altar, her eyes strayed back to where her dad’s head would be.</p><p>Mateo squeezed her hand.</p><p>She made it to the lectern and managed to make out the words before her on the page. They’d chosen to have the Mass given in Spanish and so the Bible before her was a Spanish one, turned to Ecclesiastes. She toyed with the thin ribbon of a bookmark and began to read: “Para todo hay un tiempo oportuno, y todo lo que se quiere debajo del cielo tiene su hora.” <em>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven.</em></p><p>She read confidently, because reading that way would make her mom, and her dad, proud. She read even though the tears kept threatening to overspill. But she got through it, through each verse until, “Tiempo de abrazar, y tiempo de abstenerse de abrazar.” <em>A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.</em></p><p>She’d looked up then, her wide eyes taking in all those who loved her father for the very first time. It was a large church, and the pews were full, so full that even in the aisles off the knave there were full benches of mourners.</p><p>But amongst them, in the sea of black, there was a flash of light.</p><p>Rio’s lips formed the next words and she heard herself say them: “Tiempo de buscar, y tiempo de perder.” <em>A time to seek, and a time to lose.</em> But all she could really focus on was that Agatha was there, wrapped in a woollen jacket, tucked in one of the very last pews, sandwiched between people she didn’t recognise.</p><p>The refracted light from one of the tall stained glass windows had coated Agatha in shifting reds, blues, and golds. Agatha was now half flesh, half luminous narrative.</p><p>She looked down again and continued to read, but could think only of the woman who had travelled across the country to sit silently in the back of a cold church just in case she needed her.</p><p>Rio finished her reading, felt Mat reach for her hand and squeeze it. She waited by the side until after he was done with his, and then he walked her back to her seat and Rio took her mom’s hand again and she focused in on her dad.</p><p>The <em>Ave Maria</em> is where she broke down. Her mom had to hold her through it. Something about the softness of that prayer, a petition to a parent, made the pain surge with the tremendous amount of loss she felt.</p><p>She could never speak to her dad again.</p><p>A lapsed and mostly (miraculously) guilt free Catholic, Rio didn’t believe in God. But she believed in the goodness in people. She’d grown up with a loving family, had plenty of friends, had felt the touch of women who cared for her, who’d maybe even loved her.</p><p>God had only ever really come into the equation much later, much more recently. God was present in a pair of sea blue eyes, in the woman sat below the colour-bleeding window of the thirteenth station of the cross.</p><p>The scene that sent its fragments of light over Agatha was of a deity surrendering to human hands; hands of mercy and hands of grace. It was grief rendered into glass, doctrine that had been told for centuries, now shrouding Agatha in its fragments.</p><p>Proof of God was in the woman who now sat silently waiting for her, the woman who had been bathed in light, illuminated so Rio had been able to see her. The gold haloed her hair, the royal blues adding dignity where Agatha never lacked, the wine-rich reds caressing her solemn frame. Rio’s grief-stricken mind took her back to her dad, to his words on Agatha, “tal vez seas luz para ella, y ella ha sido incapaz de ver,” <em>perhaps you are light for her, and she has been unable to see.</em></p><p>She cried some more.</p><p>When Mass was ended Rio walked with her mom back down the aisle, following her dad who was carried again by her uncles and cousins. On the way out she knew where to look this time and kept her eyes open unlike when she’d first walked in.</p><p>Agatha was standing, four rows from the back, two in from the aisle. She looked magnificent as she watched Rio and Anna with a soft frown, the delicate smile on her face making her look fragile even as she stood tall in her expensive coat.</p><p>Rio had to look away, had to focus on the next step: a private interment with the priest, and a few members of the family. Everyone else would be ushered back to Anna’s house with Alice, Mateo, and her Tía Elena all in charge of the food, the drinks, the guests.</p><p>Alice, dear, on-it, Alice, appeared just as Rio was about to step into the car with her mom.</p><p>“Did you see her?”</p><p>“Yes. Did you know she was-…?”</p><p>“I didn’t think she’d show. She’s been calling and calling. She must have got the details from Jen but-…”</p><p>“It’s fine, Alice. I just… it’s fine.”</p><p>“Okay,” Alice smiled sadly and pulled Rio down to kiss her cheek, “he’d have been so proud.”</p><p>Rio laughed as her eyes filled with tears again. “You know he’d have made a joke about being fancy enough to have an Oscar winner at his funeral.”</p><p>“Two, actually.”</p><p>Rio smiled and squeezed Alice’s arm, “I’ll see you later.”</p><p>“I love you, you know.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, returning Alice’s earlier kiss with one of her own before she slipped into the car and took her mom’s hand again.</p><p>“Yo también la vi.” <em>I saw her too.</em></p><p>Rio glanced at her mom and nodded slowly, looking down at their joined hands. “I didn’t ask her to-…”</p><p>“Entonces su presencia aquí significa más que si la hubieras tenido.” <em>Then her being here means more than if you had.</em></p><p>They were silent after that. Rio didn’t know what to say anymore. Her dad would have. Her dad would have known. But now she was on her own. She’d have to know what to say herself or else live in the silence and be okay with it.</p><p>Laying her dad to rest was unlike anything Rio had ever imagined. She’d known this day would come, of course. Every child does.</p><p>Every child with loving parents dreads this day, has sleepless nights over this day, treasures Christmases and birthdays because they may be the last they get to share with their parents. And there’s some comfort in knowing that parents dying first is how it should be.</p><p>It is the natural order of all things.</p><p>But it doesn’t make it any easier. And Rio had no way to process how wide and far-reaching this loss was. It trickled into her bloodstream and with every pump of her heart that was so like her father’s it reminded her that he wasn’t here.</p><p>By the graveside her family left her and her mom alone to mourn privately for a while, and then Rio left her mom, left her to speak with the man she’d built a life and a family with, and watched from a few feet away as she saw her own grief mirrored tenfold in Anna.</p><p>Her mom came back into her arms and Rio cradled the smaller woman close and in doing so, for the first time in their lives, they swapped roles. Rio became the caregiver, the protector of her mom’s heart and her grief.</p><p>They held each other until their tears ran dry.</p><p>Now there was nothing else to do but to go back to their home, Anna’s only, and Rio’s childhood, and speak with everyone who was there to wish them well in their hour of need.</p><p>Rio stepped from the funeral car and looked up at the busy little house in the quiet street. She could feel the vibrations from the overflow of the guests huddled in there for warmth and comfort on the early Spring day.</p><p>Anna pushed the door open first and could barely squeeze in which meant the taller Rio really stood not much chance at all but they both made it. The guests of honour couldn’t possibly left to grieve alone in the cold.</p><p>Rio blindly thanked everyone for their condolences and as she slowly pushed her way through to the living room she found who she was looking for. It was clear that Anna and Rio were no longer the main attraction.</p><p>Standing by the fireplace, holding a glass of white wine and looking a bit perplexed was a movie star. She wore a black suit with a high collared, crisp white shirt. Prada, if Rio were to guess. Her hair was loose and wavy but swept over one shoulder to show off her tight jawline and the gold, square earrings hanging from her ear.</p><p>But Rio’s eyes had been drawn to something else. Something that surprised her but didn’t shock her. She was wearing her fake engagement ring again.</p><p>She looked up and saw lips form her name but she just stood still, unable to approach or do anything other. So Agatha came to her. She watched as she gave her wine to one of Rio’s cousin’s who’d been hanging off her every word, saw as she slipped through the group that had gathered around her, and blinked as she stopped just before her.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have come.”</p><p>Agatha’s face fell instantly and Rio closed her eyes for a second as she felt her touch her hand, “I… Rio, I just wanted…”</p><p>Rio breathed out and looked down between them at the hand that held hers and carried the ring. It blinked apathetically up at her, oblivious to the dull ache it caused in Rio’s chest.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha murmured softly, “I shouldn’t have worn it.”</p><p>She must have seen Rio staring at it, staring at it <em>still</em>. And as Agatha moved to remove the ring Rio reached for her hand to stop her. “No. Don’t. It’s fine.”</p><p>She looked up again, and then around at the crowd making the small living room seem even smaller. Everyone was looking at Agatha but Agatha only had eyes for Rio.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>She turned from Agatha, trusted she’d follow, and after some squeezing and pushing she made it to the stairs in the hall.</p><p>The walk up to her bedroom felt endless. She could hear the whispers of her family and her dad’s friends as they left them all to stop and stare at Miguel Vidal’s daughter and her friend, Agatha Harkness, as they climbed the stairs to the first floor of the little house.</p><p>Rio led Agatha silently to her bedroom and left the door open for her to follow her in, hoping she would without much protest.</p><p>The room was the smallest in the house, because Rio always liked cosiness much more than she liked space - even as a child. She had her medals and trophies lined up on the shelves along the wall, a small wardrobe in the corner at the end of the little twin bed, and a desk just about squeezed in between the bed and the opposite wall. That was all she needed. She’d lived in this room from zero to eighteen, and now any time she came back home.</p><p>She took a seat on the end of her twin bed and waited until Agatha had closed the door behind herself to speak.</p><p>“How did you know where to come?”</p><p>“Alice told Jen.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, staring down at her hands in her lap. Agatha hadn’t moved, not yet anyway, she just stood by the door.</p><p>“I sent flowers to your mom but I, uh, I didn’t know what to get you.”</p><p>“I don’t need-…” but Rio had looked up at the wrong time because Agatha was pulling from her breast pocket something familiar, something thin and neatly folded. She held it out and Rio’s eyes began to stream at the sight of her old favourite shirt, held in a shaking pale hand.</p><p>“I took this from you. I… knew it was your favourite. I needed, I… there’s no excuse. I just wanted to feel you with me when you weren’t there and I was too ashamed of that to ask. I want you to have it back in… the hopes that it’ll bring you some comfort.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and tore her gaze away from the little cowboy throwing his lasso across the lapel. This shirt had once been evidence of Agatha’s love for her and now, now perhaps it was that again.</p><p>“I can’t… Agatha I can’t…”</p><p>“I know. I’m not here for any reason other than to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>Rio pressed the heels of her hands into her face, her throat felt tight, like she couldn’t breathe or like she’d forgotten how to, but she could still smell Agatha’s floral perfume, and that was enough for her to want to <em>try</em> to breathe.</p><p>“I’ll leave if you ask me to. I just needed to make sure you were okay.”</p><p>Rio released a slow breath, unashamed of its depth as it shook. She slowly moved her hands from her eyes and wiped at them quickly, sniffing as she did. “You shouldn’t have come.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“No don’t… don’t say you’re sorry just…”</p><p>And Rio made the mistake of looking up. Agatha was standing before her, standing just in front of her childhood desk, wearing her perfectly tailored Prada suit, her eyes soft and her face open.</p><p>“I can’t… I can’t deal with… with what’s going on with us right now.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Agatha, I mean it. I mean-…”</p><p>“Rio, I know. I’m here to make sure you’re okay. I’m not expecting anything or hoping anything. I just…” and Agatha took in a slow breath, her pale fingers reaching behind her to touch the small desk. “I just wanted to see you and let you know that I was here for you. If… if you need me. I’m here for <em>you</em>, not for us.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, forcing herself to look away from the person she needed most. “You should have called. I’d have told you to-…”</p><p>“I did call. Several times.”</p><p>Rio shook her head again, “I… fuck, I haven’t been on my phone. I couldn’t face it.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio groaned and went to sit on the edge of her bed, “You should have called Alice.”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze to the floor and cleared her throat, “Fuck. Right, she told me as I was leaving the church.”</p><p>“She told me not to come.”</p><p>Rio released an exhale somewhere between a laugh and a scoff and she dared to glance up again, “I’m assuming Jen did too?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip as she kept her eyes on Agatha, watching the way she stood so still as if she moved she might frighten Rio away. She kept her gaze on her for a few seconds before she motioned to the space beside her on the small twin bed.</p><p>Agatha moved over without saying anything and sat about a foot away from Rio. The bed creaked as Rio remained frozen in place.</p><p>“I liked him a lot,” Agatha said after a few seconds of silence. “He was kind and good with Nicky.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said quietly, frowning down at her hands in her lap. “He was the best of us.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a while and Rio closed her eyes to try and focus on something that wasn’t the immense feeling of loss in her chest. “Are you leaving tonight?”</p><p>“In the morning. I couldn’t get a flight tonight.”</p><p>Rio nodded blindly, her fingers twisting and twisting in her lap until a gentle hand on them made them still. “I made you something.”</p><p>Rio turned slowly, her fingers adjusting to hold Agatha’s hand before she could stop them. Between devastation and softness she looked at Agatha’s face and wanted to cry for her being here suddenly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I…” moving her free hand to the inner pocket of her jacket again she produced a scrunched up piece of paper. It was light green and looked like nothing at all. But she held it out like it was precious, like she was proud of it. “The flower, remember? I couldn’t get it quite right so this is the best of them and it’s still not… it’s a flower. For you.”</p><p>Rio pulled both hands from beneath Agatha’s gentle hold on them and scooped up the little ball of paper. Whether it was because she knew what it was meant to be or because she was so affected by Agatha’s confidence in handing over this ball of scrap paper, she began to see the creases of where the petals were - stronger than the folds Agatha had made in error but that were still visible. She touched the centre of it delicately, half expecting it to crumble completely in her hand. But it didn’t, it remained together, surprisingly strong, though misshapen and messy.</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha and leant in slowly, grateful Agatha didn’t move at all as she pressed a soft kiss to her cheek. Agatha felt how she always felt, she smelled how she always smelled, but something was different. She’d changed. Or perhaps Rio had.</p><p>Rio pulled away and kept her gaze down, unwilling to look into the blue eyes that haunted her still. She looked instead at the gift still cradled in her right hand.</p><p>“Nicky wanted to give you your jersey back,” Agatha said softly, “he wanted to be here too. Said he could play basketball with you to make you smile.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and wondered whether even Nicky could cheer her up now. Her little cousins had provided at least a little light in the darkness but then again, they weren’t made in her image, they weren’t Agatha’s son.</p><p>But kids didn’t belong at funerals. Kids didn’t belong around death and grief and Rio knew Nicky was so sensitive, so gentle, that he’d inevitably be upset if he saw how broken she was. So distance was best. Agatha had made the right choice not to bring him. And Rio was glad he wasn’t there.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip and wiped quickly at her eyes as they filled again with tears. “I can’t believe you’re here.”</p><p>“I couldn’t not be.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, still unable to look up, “it hurts to see you like this. And right now my whole body hurts. Everything… everything hurts and I-…”</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you, Rio.”</p><p>“Can’t you see you already have?”</p><p>Rio looked up then and saw what she’d been trying to avoid. Agatha’s eyes were full of tears, the blue now sparkling back at her, making her feel sick again. “I made a mistake.”</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio said quickly, standing and placing the flower on the bed where she’d just been sat. “I can’t deal with it. It’s too much, Agatha.”</p><p>Behind her, Agatha looked down at the abandoned gift and picked it back up again, toying with it gently in her hand. Rio reached her old desk and stared down at it, taking comfort in the little girl she once was who’d carved her name into the wood. She traced her finger over the ‘R’ and tried to calm the tide of unresolved anger and confusion that was bubbling just below the surface, hiding the broken heart underneath.</p><p>“I know you don’t want to talk about it,” Agatha uttered after a few more seconds of heavy silence, “and I promise I didn’t come to discuss it. And this will be the last thing I’ll say on it. I’ll… I’ll leave you with your family. But you should know that I’ll wait however long it takes. I came here only to make sure you were okay. Alice has only been giving me vague updates and… I had to see you.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, her finger just on the apex of the ‘I’.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice sounded a little stronger this time, and the bed creaking told Rio she’d stood up. “I’m so sorry for your loss, I really am.”</p><p>A wave of Agatha’s perfume hit her as the brunette moved to lean around and Rio opened her eyes just in time to see a pale hand placing the flower on the side next to her crumpled cowboy shirt. She turned her head to watch Agatha leave her childhood bedroom and when the door closed behind her she fell to the floor in tears.</p><p>The door was opened again not two minutes later and Rio knew immediately whose arms had wrapped around her. She sobbed into Alice’s shoulder, clutching at her friend until she could breathe again, disrupted only by soft hiccups that came every few seconds.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Alice kept repeating as she stroked through Rio’s hair, holding her as close as possible.</p><p>“Has she… gone?”</p><p>“Yes, I think so. Not before she sent me to you.”</p><p>Rio whimpered and pressed her face closer to Alice’s shoulder, aware her shirt was now sodden but not caring about it one bit. After a while Alice spoke again, pulling away to look at Rio and wipe gently below her eyes, “Did she come here to get you back?”</p><p>“No, she… just to make sure I was okay.”</p><p>Alice nodded and Rio avoided her gaze as she moved to extricate herself from her friend. The clarity that comes after a cry hit her solidly in the chest and she moved to stand and begin fixing herself in the mirror. Although there was no hiding her bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“I can make excuses for you, you know. If you want me to?”</p><p>“No. I need to be there for my mom. I should get back.”</p><p>Rio turned back to Alice only when she thought she looked passable enough to be seen though her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were still bloodshot. But she wasn’t crying anymore and everyone would excuse her because it was her dad’s funeral, in any case.</p><p>Together they went back down to the wake and Rio found that far from the reception she’d expected, no one was much interested in her. And it didn’t take long to find out why.</p><p>Squashed in by the fireplace in the living room, Rio spotted Agatha standing with a baby in her arms and her mother by her side, cooing down at Rio’s newest little cousin. Anna’s hand was on Agatha’s shoulder and she seemed to be the instigator of this little scene.</p><p>It felt like it had been facilitated just for her. Like her mom had read her mind and handed Agatha a tiny baby with a shock of dark hair. Like she’d made Agatha look calm and serene amongst her admirers as she cradled the child.</p><p>She was the Pietà in the window. She was the colour in the glass. She was the mercy and grace of mournful hands.</p><p>Around them the familiar faces of her aunts and cousins were all beaming at Agatha, all trying to get close, all speaking over each other for her attention. And as usual her uncles and male cousins were on the periphery, talking about sports or something but turning every now and again to look at the movie star by the wall.</p><p>No one but Agatha had looked up when Rio entered the room and she looked a little guilty when she caught Rio’s confused gaze but her mom clearly said something to her and had taken her attention again and Agatha was drawn back into Anna Vidal’s clutches.</p><p>“I thought-,” Rio began but Alice interrupted already, “I guess it’s hard to say no to a widow.”</p><p>Rio nodded and maintained eye contact with Agatha, watching as she bounced the tiny dark-haired baby expertly in her arms. She was a natural at it. A natural mother, born to be one. It was clear in how she was with Nicky.</p><p>And now, for the first time, Rio saw her with an actual baby. The sight was overwhelming.</p><p>Rio bit her lip and turned from the crowd to slink off into the kitchen seeking wine. Lots of wine. Alice traipsed after her and it didn’t take either of them long to find what they were looking for.</p><p>“I guess it’s not often you have a movie star in your house,” Alice was saying as she poured Rio a generous glass of red.</p><p>“I have an Oscar.”</p><p>“Yeah but you’re just Rio.”</p><p>“Thanks so much. My dad just died, you know. Could be a little softer.”</p><p>Alice smiled up at her and Rio smiled back, dropping her gaze quickly before she felt the promise of tears once more.</p><p>“I brought a little treat for later. Something to help you sleep.”</p><p>“Mom will kill you.”</p><p>“That’s fine, so long as you get some rest.”</p><p>Rio smiled into her wine as she took two large gulps but almost choked on the second when her mom’s voice filled the little kitchen, “Mija, getting drunk at your own father’s velatorio.”</p><p>Rio spluttered and slapped her own chest, “It’s my first wine. I’m not exactly-…” but her words were cut short when Agatha appeared just behind her mom, having given back the baby cousin of Rio’s she’d been holding.</p><p>“Hi. Estaba a punto de irme y entonces…” <em>I was just about to leave and then-…</em></p><p>“¡Tonterías! Te quedas. Tenemos espacio y mucha comida.” <em>Nonsense! You’re staying. We have room and plenty of food.</em></p><p>Over Anna’s shoulder Agatha caught Rio’s eye and she hesitated for a second before she nodded and looked back down to the woman now holding her at her shoulders. “Okay, gracias.”</p><p>“Teach my daughter to improve her grammar whilst you’re at it,” Anna said with a smile over in Rio’s direction. Rio rolled her eyes and moved to settle against the corner of the counter top, taking another small sip of wine.</p><p>Anna left the small kitchen and as soon as she did, Rio hopped up onto the side, something her dad always allowed but her mom did not. She was now left with Agatha and Alice and was aware of them both watching her with interest, one making the move to stand closer than she had been before.</p><p>“Where are you staying?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Alice, now beside her against the counter, she looked tense and so Rio reached out to take her hand.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze fell to the movement as she answered: “The Marriott by the airport.”</p><p>“Not very glamorous,” Alice said archly as Rio turned her head to look out the window. Outside the grass was dewy, a deep green in the bright of the day. It reminded Rio of endless spring days spent running around the lawn with her dad. Her grip tightened and whatever was said in the room was lost to her as she disappeared into her own mind.</p><p>Around her the kitchen began to fill and Rio was unceremoniously battered about, manhandled out of the way by insistent hands looking for food or more drink and she found herself slipping into the yard before she even knew where she was going.</p><p>Alice came with her and Agatha too.</p><p>The cold air was refreshing and Rio luxuriated in the sharpness of it against her bare arms until a jacket was placed over her and she turned to the culprit, seeing Agatha now standing in her crisp white shirt, looking anywhere but at Rio.</p><p>Swallowing down her gratitude, Rio turned away and looked back out over the lawn, her memories now gone, her mind stuttering its way back to reality as she gripped the lapel of the borrowed jacket with her free hand.</p><p>“Rio, you’ll freeze out here.”</p><p>“Go back in,” Rio said quietly, not looking around at Alice, “I’m fine.”</p><p>“I’ll stay with her,” Agatha said from just over Rio’s shoulder and Rio closed her eyes as she felt Alice touch her arm and heard the door close behind her as she went back in.</p><p>“You must be cold.”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“I was leaving Rio and then your mom-…”</p><p>“She can be persuasive,” Rio said with a shrug, letting Agatha know she wasn’t mad at her.</p><p>“Must be genetic.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to see Agatha smiling, a sad sort of smile that looked wistful. “If it were we wouldn’t be in this mess.”</p><p>Turning back around Rio knocked back the rest of her wine.</p><p>“I was angry.”</p><p>“You’ve said.”</p><p>“I wanted to-…”</p><p>“Hurt me, I get it.”</p><p>“<em>No.</em>” Rio turned as Agatha stepped closer, her face firm for the first time that day, her eyes bright again, “Never you. <em>Me</em>. I wanted… I wanted to…”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said quickly, “I know. I know. We just… can’t talk about this,” Rio said in a low but urgent whisper, “Please. I can’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed briefly but she nodded and dropped her gaze to Rio’s free hand, her own fingers twitching by her sides and drew Rio’s attention to them. Her pale skin looked practically blue now in the cold and Rio reached for them instinctually, curling her warmer hand around them to bring them up to her lips where she kissed Agatha’s cool palm and murmured, “You shouldn’t have come.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath and Rio’s gaze dropped to the mauve lipstick she’d worn for the occasion. The colour was new, or at least Rio hadn’t seen it before, and she found herself transfixed on it as Agatha’s lips formed the words: “I want to make sure you’re okay. I want to be here in case you need me. Please.”</p><p>The door opened behind them and Rio turned with Agatha’s hand still held up close to her lips and saw her mom standing looking at them with a small smile on her face. “Mija, entrada.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, watching her mom’s dark eyes travel to the hand near her face and the blazer over her shoulders.</p><p>“Agatha, ¿te quedas esta noche? Me enojaría mucho si nos dejaras.” <em>Stay tonight? I would be upset with you if you left us.</em></p><p>“Mamá.”</p><p>“Sin argumentos, Rio.” <em>No arguments, Rio.</em></p><p>Rio sighed quietly and brought Agatha’s hand down so it hung, still held, between them and Anna turned to leave the two of them alone again.</p><p>“I won’t stay if-…”</p><p>“She’ll insist,” Rio said quietly, “Alice is in the spare guest room. You can share with her.”</p><p>Agatha nodded silently and Rio shot her a quick glance before she stepped around her, unaware or unconcerned that she was still holding her hand.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>She felt Agatha tug at her from where she now stood just two feet behind her and Rio’s other hand rested on the door handle.</p><p>“I want to make it right.”</p><p>Rio froze where she stood, halfway between Agatha and the grief she felt in her bones.</p><p>But Agatha hadn’t moved either, she simply held the hand that still held hers and after a few more seconds of silence Rio said, “I need time, Agatha. My dad I…” she sucked in a breath and felt Agatha squeeze her fingers, “I can’t think about anything else right now.”</p><p>Agatha released her hand and Rio didn’t look back as she stepped into the warm house. She squeezed past various members of her family and disappeared back to her room to change.</p><p>Her funeral clothes felt stifling. She could barely breathe for the black that clung to her body; for the reminder of her loss. In the mirror she looked just as she had that morning only with her eyes a little less bright and Agatha’s expensive blazer over her shoulders.</p><p>She tugged at it, felt the rich fabric between her fingers, and in adjusting, in luxuriating in the feel of it around her body, she felt something hard against her chest. Lifting the right side of the jacket she fished in the breast pocket and pulled out a pair of glasses. She’d seen them before, but only in her tiny phone screen one night weeks go now.</p><p>She turned them over in her hands. They were large, metallic aviators, and as Rio tried them on she realised that if her vision were this blurry suddenly then Agatha must need to wear these much more than she did.</p><p>She took them off, folded the legs back delicately and placed them down on her desk. It was the perfect metaphor, really. Agatha had the tools she needed to see better but kept them hidden, used so seldomly that even Rio, who had seen so much of her, been allowed access to her deepest secrets, had only seen her in them once.</p><p>She shrugged Agatha’s jacket onto her bed and slipped from her dress to change into dark sweats and her favourite cowboy shirt that now smelt of Agatha.</p><p>As she was about to leave her eyes caught the discarded glasses and she pocketed them. She returned to the gathering downstairs and found herself soon on the floor beside her favourite cousin, leaning against his side as they sat together against the wall.</p><p>“She’s like ridiculously hot.”</p><p>“Yes, I’ve heard.”</p><p>“Like… I’d let her fuck me if she wanted to. With her fucking Oscar if that’s what she wanted.”</p><p>Rio laughed despite herself, only nudging Mat gently in the ribs when the littlest of the Vidal cousins ran past with chocolate all over her face.</p><p>“She’s married.”</p><p>“Still. Movie stars aren’t monogamous. They don’t have to be. They’re better than us.”</p><p>“Does everyone keep forgetting I’ve won an Oscar?”</p><p>“No, unfortunately not. Your mom mentions it every time I see her.”</p><p>Rio smiled and began plucking at the fabric over her knee, “Well this movie star is only into one girl at a time.”</p><p>“Liar. You’re not the relationship type.”</p><p>“Maybe I’ve changed.”</p><p>Rio’s centre of gravity was suddenly shifted as Mateo lifted his arm from beside her to wrap around her and he tugged her into his chest, managing to seamlessly ruffle her hair as he did.</p><p>She screamed out and wrestled with him, escaping only when he released her with a grin. “Not changed enough to be able to get out of a headlock.”</p><p>“Ass.” Rio huffed as she tried to flatten down her hair and turned her attention to the child now running full pelt at her and she scooped her up, protecting her from smacking into the wall. Her attention was down on her cousin as Agatha walked in the room and she didn’t spot her until she was once again child free.</p><p>“Like,” Mat muttered beside her as Agatha made her way over, carrying what looked like a plate full of cookies. “Isn’t that just every man’s dream.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said as she stopped just before them, her crisp white shirt now rolled up to her elbows, the top two bottoms undone, “Your mom said you hadn’t eaten anything.”</p><p>“So you’re bringing me cookies?”</p><p>“It was better than wine.”</p><p>“I’d rather the-…”</p><p>But Mat beside her was rushing to his feet, “Agatha. I’m Mateo. Rio’s favourite cousin, and second biggest fan of yours.”</p><p>“Second?” Agatha asked curiously as she raised her gaze from Rio to the man now before her.</p><p>“Yeah, Rio first, obviously. Beats me only because she wants to f-…”</p><p>“Jesus, Mateo.”</p><p>Agatha’s soft smile had grown across her face and Rio scowled at the sight of it, “She does, does she?”</p><p>“He didn’t even finish his sentence.”</p><p>“I filled in the blanks.”</p><p>Rio huffed and pulled her knees close to her chest as Agatha went to sit beside her, and held out the cookies, “Cookie?”</p><p>“I said I wanted wine.”</p><p>Mateo was back on Rio’s other side and reached across for a cookie, “Agatha Harkness doesn’t fetch you things. People bring things to <em>her</em>. Alice will fetch you wine.”</p><p>And Mat shouted for Rio’s manager just as Rio laughed and relented in her stubbornness and took a cookie. “I like him,” Agatha muttered from the corner of her mouth, smiling a little when Rio glanced at her. “You just like being complimented.”</p><p>“Ever thought about the girl thing, Agatha?”</p><p>Rio choked on the cookie she’d just taken a bite out of and found two hands slapping her back as she leant forwards to try to dislodge it.</p><p>Only once she was righted again, cheeks flushed and eyes wide, did Agatha respond. “No. But if I had, I think your cousin here would have a fair shot.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha and then looked to Mat, “You can’t just ask people if they have ever thought about-…”</p><p>“Why not? I just told you I’d swing for Agatha if she asked.”</p><p>“Flattering, thank you.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed a little as she leant her head back against the wall, “You’re supposed to be nice to me today.”</p><p>“I’d say the biggest movie star in the world saying they’d go for you if they had to is pretty nice,” Matt whispered loud enough for Agatha to hear too.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything and instead finished her cookie, watching as the eyes of the Vidal clan in the room with them kept swivelling in their direction. It was clear the excitement of having Agatha there hadn’t died down yet.</p><p>Rio glanced across at Agatha, unable to see her face properly without turning her head. But she watched as she pulled her knees up to the sky, placed the cookies by her side and put her hands in her lap.</p><p>Agatha in a suit like this was truly a sight to see. If she turned just slightly, and if Agatha moved just an inch or two, her shirt would open that little bit more and she’d see just a slither extra of the pale, freckly skin of her chest. It was tragedy that she couldn’t.</p><p>She let her eyes travel the lengths of her thighs before they settled on her hands and she found herself wanting to reach for them, something Agatha had clearly picked up on because she reached her hand across to hold Rio’s own thigh. “Your mom was telling me you didn’t eat anything yesterday.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered, her gaze now on the pale hand on her dark sweats. “She shouldn’t have told you that.”</p><p>“Hey,” Mat leant over and Rio turned to her cousin, hoping he’d save her, “It’s a stress reaction. Been that way since she was a kid.”</p><p>“Thanks, <em>Mateo</em>.”</p><p>“Just explaining.” He looked at Agatha with a grin, “Usually breaks for chocolate ice cream or something when she’s starving though.”</p><p>“Fabulous, thank you, <em>Mateo</em>.”</p><p>“You want some chocolate ice cream?”</p><p>Rio rolled her head back where it rested against the wall and looked at Agatha in surprise. Matt leant further around to do the same and raised his brows at the movie star.</p><p>“You’re offering my big cousin ice cream?”</p><p>“Do you want some?”</p><p>Rio was a little taken aback by how unmoved Agatha was by her cousin’s teasing and she found that she couldn’t speak for a second, shocked by the care mixed into the offer, “No, thank you. I just had a cookie.”</p><p>“It was tiny! A hot woman offering you ice cream, Rio! That Oscar really did work wonders.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little but for Agatha’s eyes only and then turned away again, feeling the same warmth in her chest as Agatha squeezed her thigh and then pulled her hand away.</p><p>Rio disappeared into her own thoughts again as Mat spoke over her to get to Agatha, asking her everything and anything about her career, her life, and Hollywood.</p><p>She thought of her dad, of the relief she’d heard in his voice that last night. “Estoy orgullosa de ti, mija. Ahora, duerme. Sueña con todo lo bueno que te mereces. Sueña con Agatha y con lo que te espera cuando estés lista. Te amo.” <em>I'm proud of you, daughter. Now, sleep. Dream of all the good things you deserve. Dream of Agatha, and what will be waiting for you when you're ready. I love you.</em></p><p>She closed her eyes and thought of him sitting before her and saying those words with the smile she’d stolen from him and now showed off on billboards and magazine covers. She thought of what he’d say if he say her now, sandwiched between her cousin and her future. Maybe he’d simply smile and wink, maybe he’d come over and kiss both of Agatha’s cheeks and welcome her to the family.</p><p>Maybe he’d tell a story so mortifying that Agatha would laugh for days and Rio would feel warm with affection and embarrassment.</p><p>Maybe, maybe, maybe.</p><p>Maybe if he hadn’t died Agatha wouldn’t even be speaking to her. Maybe the universe where Miguel was alive was the only one where they would work it out.</p><p>She felt Agatha’s hand on her thigh again, anchoring her to reality so she didn’t slip into the darkest recesses of her mind.</p><p>The trio remained that way for over an hour, the only thing occasionally jolting Rio out of her near-catatonic state were the family members who came over to say goodbye and whom she stood for to hug and thank them for coming. But she always returned to her position squashed between her cousin and her Agatha. Silent. Unmoved.</p><p>And soon the room was quiet again, with just the three of them huddled against the wall. Rio’s glass had been filled with red wine at some point but she’d finished it so she was now sharing Agatha’s wine, passing the glass back and forth without ever having to ask to the other to do so.</p><p>“It’s crazy, isn’t it? Feels like yesterday we were wrestling on this rug and now… we’re back on it again because… Tío Miguel died.”</p><p>Rio had been passing the wine back to Agatha in that moment and she felt Agatha’s hand enclose around her fingers. As they held the glass in midair she felt her breath leave her body.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmured, her free hand moving to Rio’s thigh, which didn’t help her breathing situation.</p><p>“Sorry, Rio. I didn’t mean-…”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio said quickly, neither angry at Mat nor embarrassed that a tear had slipped. But she let Agatha take the glass and moved quickly to wipe at her eyes. “It just repeats, you know. Sometimes it repeats.”</p><p>“Are you crying because of your dad or because your mom’s had the same rug for thirty years?”</p><p>Rio laughed and leant her head back against the wall, her hand automatically moving to Agatha’s to hold it, “You’re such an ass.”</p><p>Mat grinned and nudged her arm, “I think I’d win the wrestling matches now though.”</p><p>“Don’t count on it,” Rio muttered as she closed her eyes and interlocked her fingers with Agatha.</p><p>“I’m not sure it’s appropriate to wrestle at a wake.”</p><p>Rio smiled at Agatha’s comment, squeezing her hand as it rested against her thigh, “Thank you for the advice, mi amor.”</p><p>The world stopped then as Mat beside her gasped and Rio opened her eyes to turn to him, his eyes wide and his mouth open even wider. “I <em>knew</em> it.”</p><p>“Mateo.”</p><p>“Rio it’s okay,” Agatha said from the other side of her. She leant over slightly and Rio sucked in a breath. Mateo’s eyes flashed with excitement as he turned his attention to Agatha and Rio turned her head too, staring straight ahead to keep both of them in her sights.</p><p>“We’re just friends who are playing wives in a movie. I’m just here as a friend.”</p><p>Agatha’s words hit harder than Rio had expected them too. But she couldn’t deny them. Technically Agatha was correct. Technically they were friends.</p><p>“Damn,” Matt said with a laugh, “because I was about to say how hot the two of you would be together and how Rio would be so losing her shit if she thought for even a second that she-…”</p><p>“Okay, thank you, <em>Mateo</em>.”</p><p>Agatha had squeezed her hand and Rio sighed as she relaxed back again but still held firmly to Agatha. “Mateo?”</p><p>Both Rio and her cousin turned to look at Agatha, both with equal amounts of surprise and curiosity across their faces. “I told your aunt I’d look after Rio today but she’s holding my hand pretty tight so would you be a doll and go and fetch her some chocolate ice cream for me?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and was about to say something when Mateo nodded and jumped up, “Sure, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>And Rio watched him go with a scowl, not believing that he’d just fallen under Agatha’s spell so easily.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“No,” Rio admitted, watching her cousin practically hop to the kitchen. “No, I’m not.”</p><p>“Is there anything I can do?”</p><p><em>Leave forever. Stay forever.</em></p><p>“No, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio thought she’d remain silent but she asked quietly: “Have you really not been eating at all?”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and shrugged her shoulders, “I just don’t feel like it.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence where Rio had shuffled forwards to land on her knees and lean across for an open bottle of red wine on the coffee table. She grabbed it and filled the glass she’d been sharing with Agatha and then leant back but found when she did that Agatha’s arm had been outstretched and she was now sitting in the crook of it.</p><p>Her body reacted before her mind could and she curled into her, turning herself a little to lean back properly into Agatha’s side.</p><p>It felt normal, nice, and even as Agatha’s hand curled around her hip and her fingers splayed to hold more of her than she’d held in days it still felt good. Perhaps she’d had too much wine, perhaps grief had dulled her other senses, or maybe being held by Agatha Harkness would always feel good.</p><p>Even if she’d broken her heart. Even if Rio should know better than to relax into her. Even if they needed to take it slow.</p><p>“This okay?”</p><p>Rio ignored the question because she knew Agatha already knew well enough that it was. Rio instead offered Agatha the glass first and Agatha took it, took a sip, and handed it back.</p><p>“Hey, here-…” Matt had appeared before them again, had faltered when he saw how his cousin was now sitting curled into the most famous woman in the world, how their fingers were overlapping around the shared glass they now held together.</p><p>Rio didn’t look up, Agatha did.</p><p>Mateo smiled a little, his shoulders dropping from where they’d been up by his ears. “¿Cuánto tiempo, prima? ¿Cuánto tiempo llevas guardando este secreto?” <em>How long, cuz? How long have you been keeping this secret?</em></p><p>Goddamn fucking Mateo and his goddamn fucking incurable need to pry.</p><p>Rio began to pull away then, ready to deny, ready to tell her younger cousin to shut the hell up, but Agatha held on, Agatha hadn’t moved.</p><p>“¿Mateo? Quiero mucho a tu prima. Pero estoy casado, no lo estaré por mucho tiempo más, pero necesito protegerla, a ella y a mi hijo. ¿Puedo confiar en que no dirás nada?” <em>Mateo? I love your cousin. Very much. But I'm married, I won’t be for much longer, but I need to keep her safe, her and my son. Can I trust you won't say anything?</em></p><p>Rio felt as though she were suddenly made from glass, as though she might shatter any second. Miraculously she was able to raise her gaze to look up at her cousin, to see how he might take this. His favourite actress and his favourite cousin.</p><p>He didn’t need to know that they weren’t together, that they were still figuring things out, that every time Rio touched Agatha now she felt like she might die.</p><p>Because Agatha was claiming her, was confessing her love, was asking for help to keep Rio safe.</p><p>And suddenly the glass transformed into sand, and Rio wanted to spread herself over Agatha. She wanted to bury herself in the woman in every and any way she could. But staying pressed into the crook of her arm would have to do for now.</p><p>And Mateo watched, he crouched down, he held out the generous portion of chocolate ice cream he’d sourced for Rio.</p><p>“Tu secreto está a salvo conmigo. El tío Miguel querría que hiciera todo lo posible por ayudarte...” <em>Your secret's safe with me. Uncle Miguel would want me to do everything I could to help...</em></p><p>He’d trailed off, biting on the corner of his lip. Rio turned to him again and smiled gratefully, sadly. “Thank you.”</p><p>As she took the bowl from him she squeezed Mat’s hand, watched him walk away and shoot them both a wink over his shoulder, and then they were alone again, and suddenly Rio didn’t feel so sure about being practically in Agatha’s lap.</p><p>Perhaps she was overstepping.</p><p>She made to shift away but Agatha had changed her hold to hold her tighter and Rio gasped quietly when she felt Agatha’s thumb just ghost over the skin at her hip. “I haven’t been able to,” she began softly, and if Rio didn’t know about better she might think Agatha was going to cry, “hold you through… <em>any</em> of this. And I don’t want to overstep but I don’t think I’ll get another chance so…”</p><p>Agatha turned to her and Rio saw that her eyes were filling with tears, her cheeks a soft shade of pink. “Please let me.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips and nodded, soon settling back down to focus on eating her ice cream. As the cool of it began to chill her body, Agatha pulled her in closer, draped the hand that held their shared wine across her, protected her from the cold.</p><p>Grief, like anything, expands and wanes without warning. Only this was the first time Rio had felt any reprieve in her pain. Agatha holding her was the most comfort she’d felt in days now. The soft, tender circles she was drawing against her hip were all she focused on as she continued to eat the ice cream and lean back against her.</p><p>At some point Agatha’s fingers stretched across her hip and she felt them come into contact with the hard shape in the pocket of her pyjama pants and Agatha soon was pulling out her own glasses from Rio’s pocket.</p><p>“My jacket,” Agatha concluded softly as Rio turned to watch her hide the glasses in her hand and place them in her own lap.</p><p>She stared for a second, watching Agatha curl her fingers more around the frames before she said: “You’re ashamed of them.”</p><p>“Not ashamed, just-…” Rio had reached for them, found them easy to steal from beneath Agatha’s hand that simply opened up for her as she touched it. She lifted them then and hung them from the opening of Agatha’s shirt. The pad of her forefinger had just grazed her chest as she placed the glasses there and stolen the breath left in her lungs.</p><p>She was staring, she knew she was. But how could she not? How could she possibly force herself to look away from Agatha when she’d been in the depths of despair for days now and the six inches of pale, freckly skin on display were the one fragment of joy she’d experienced this whole time.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked and  silently sat up, breaking Agatha’s hold on her.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>“I just… I just need a minute.”</p><p>She heard Agatha say a soft ‘okay’ behind her as she strode from the room and made it to the bathroom just in time to gasp in a heavy breath as the tears began to fall from her eyes. She locked the door and cried silently for her dad, for wanting him <em>here</em>, and for wanting Agatha to never let go.</p><p>There was a gentle knock some time after Rio had begun to wipe away her tears with the toilet tissue and Rio opened to door to see Alice standing expectantly. Rio stepped back and Alice stepped inside.</p><p>“Agatha sent me.”</p><p>Rio nodded and sniffed quietly, brushing away her tears still, “She told Mateo. He saw us sitting together and she told him.”</p><p>Alice nodded and reached for some tissue to help Rio with her tears. “Always did like that kid. Apart from that one time he got to drunk at that after party.”</p><p>Rio laughed at the memory of Mateo spilling red wine all over the cream carpet of a Director’s living room and crying over it in the cab home. She’d grown up with that boy. She knew he’d protect their secret.</p><p>“You okay?” Alice asked for what must have been the millionth time that day.</p><p>“No. Not even slightly.”</p><p>“Why? Someone die?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t help but laugh at her best friend and then groaned as she caught sight of herself in the mirror looking like the mess she felt. “Jesus.”</p><p>“You <em>have</em> looked better.”</p><p>Rio huffed and went about splashing water on her face, and wiping herself down with a nearby towel.</p><p>“I hear she’s staying?”</p><p>“Sharing with you.”</p><p>“Yeah, we’ll see how long that lasts.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again and nudged her friend as she turned back to her, “In my twin bed? I’m not an animal.”</p><p>“No, but you’re vulnerable and you like to be close to people. You like to be close to <em>Agatha</em>.” Alice eyed her closely, her gaze skirting over her face before it fell to her shirt, “I thought you’d lost that. I hate that thing.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio protested as she nudged her friend. “I love it.”</p><p>“Hideous,” Alice said, and jumped quickly away from Rio’s slapping hand. She winked as she disappeared and Rio sighed as he did what she could to fix her face and leave the solitude of the little bathroom to join the others again.</p><p>The house was so quiet now, and back in the living room the remainder of the visitors were gathered. Actually, really just one visitor: Agatha.</p><p>Her mom and Alice were on the couch and Agatha was sitting in an armchair off to the side, cradling the glass she’d been sharing earlier with Rio. It was strange to see Agatha so casually draped in what was her dad’s favourite chair, in her little house, on her normal street, in a town that didn’t often see movie stars come to visit.</p><p>Agatha belonged where the glamorous people were. She belonged under the lights, surrounded by fancy people in their fancy clothes. And yet here she was, surrounded by normal people in their normal clothes, looking not one bit out of place.</p><p>Rio took a seat between her mom and Alice and saw Agatha shift a little where she sat. She wondered if she’d wanted her to squeeze in with her instead. But that would have been only possible in another reality, another time.</p><p>They made casual small talk, Agatha and Anna holding down the conversation mostly. All in Spanish, all very polite, all very normal.</p><p>Agatha spoke a lot about Nicky and Anna asked a lot about him. They talked about the movie and how filming was going. They discussed Agatha’s flight over and how lovely the Mass was. They talked about Rio’s mad cousins and the cute baby.</p><p>And when the talking was exhausted, they turned to the television and watched some black and white movie that meant nothing to Rio or anyone else in the room.</p><p>Through it all, Rio kept looking to Agatha. She kept checking on her, looking to see if she were uncomfortable or upset or bored. But she was none of those things. She looked, more than anything, happy to be there.</p><p>And Agatha kept checking on her too. Or just looking, Rio reminded herself. Agatha was just looking, just taking everything in. But their eyes kept meeting and Rio’s heart kept struggling inside her chest, fighting against muscle and bone to get to Agatha.</p><p>Another life, another time, didn’t matter anymore. Because as the movie went on and as Rio spent more and more of her time looking at Agatha instead of the screen, she wanted to move across and sit with her. She wanted to pull Agatha into her side and hold her like Agatha had held her earlier on the floor, as she’d asked her cousin to help her protect her.</p><p>But she didn’t move, she just looked, just watched, just sat mesmerised by Agatha Harkness in her house, in her dad’s chair, there for her.</p><p>By the time everyone agreed that they should be in bed, Rio was beyond exhausted. She clung to the banister as she climbed the stairs and huffed to herself as she rummaged for clothes Agatha could borrow to sleep in.</p><p>Anna had provided Agatha with a toothbrush and a towel for the morning and when Rio went in to deliver clothes for her she found Agatha waiting alone at the bottom of the double guest bed she’d be sharing with Alice.</p><p>She was still in her shirt, still in her expensive pants, still wearing her fake ring, still looking more beautiful than Rio could even comprehend.</p><p>“Here, these should be okay.” In no world did Rio really think a ratty ‘University of Delaware’ t-shirt and plaid pyjama pants would be considered ‘okay’ for Agatha but she had little choice. But then in the secret world inside her head, she was also desperate to see her in them. “There’s an extra blanket in the cupboard if it gets cold.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said quietly, smiling a little as she accepted the clothes. She seemed to hesitate before she said: “You’re wearing your necklace.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and automatically lifted her hand to toy with the necklace that she hadn’t bothered to remove when she’d changed earlier. She couldn’t find the words to say that would make the situation feel better so she instead just said, “I should leave you to it.”</p><p>“Will you be okay tonight?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and as Rio turned to leave she said, “I’m sorry I told Mateo. I hope I didn’t-…”</p><p>Rio paused where she was by the door and as she turned to say something Alice had arrived so Rio said nothing and only wished Alice goodnight before she made her way back down the hall to push her sweatpants off herself and crawl into her own small bed.</p><p>But sleep didn’t come, as she expected it wouldn’t.</p><p>Rio rolled over. Then she rolled the other way. Then the previous way. Then back again.</p><p>She was too hot, too cold, too awake, too tired.</p><p>She huffed and threw the covers off.</p><p>Now she was definitely too cold.</p><p>She climbed out of bed, taking a second to think, her bare feet on the familiar old carpet, her head in her hands. She would just go and see, just go check on her best friend and the woman she was sleeping with. It was a kindness, really. Making sure they were comfortable in her parents’ - no, her mother’s - home.</p><p>Her steps were light as she padded down the hallway to the guest bedroom at the back of the house. The door was ajar so she stood just outside it, listening to the soft sounds of Alice’s gentle snores.</p><p>Deciding a visual check would be good too, she cautiously pushed the door to and peeked inside. In the dark she could just make out two bodies on either side of the bed. One was curled up, and this one, from the size of her, she knew to be Alice.</p><p>The other was on the far side of the bed, and was moving to sit up. Agatha was awake.</p><p>Rio stared at her, unable to make out her features but knowing that Agatha was looking at her too. She held her breath as Agatha moved again, this time turning to slip from the bed.</p><p>Rio hadn’t prepared for this eventuality, hadn’t practiced what she might say or how she might say it. But Agatha was already in front of her by the time she had realised what was happening.</p><p>They looked at each other. Agatha looked disarming like this; her hair up in a messy bun, wearing Rio’s old t-shirt and plaid pyjama pants. But she also looked strangely bright and alert as if sleep hadn’t touched her at all that night.</p><p>Neither said anything and just as it was getting difficult to look any longer Rio found herself inclining her head back down the hall and she turned to go back to her bedroom, knowing Agatha would follow.</p><p>She waited just inside her room and held the door for Agatha to enter. She closed it behind her and turned to see Agatha standing at the foot of her bed, a strange nighttime facsimile of the Agatha who had stood there this afternoon.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t look at her again. She instead moved around her and slipped into her bed. Only Agatha didn’t move. She was staring at the desk and Rio’s eyes had adjusted now so she could see that she was looking at where Rio had placed her paper flower on the plinth of her Oscar statue before she’d crawled into bed.</p><p>“Agatha?” Agatha turned to her. “Will you get in, please?”</p><p>She’d been waiting for permission, like a vampire turned up on a doorstep, seeking access but having to wait for the verbal cue. She moved soundlessly, and climbed in beside Rio, already on her side for her, already opening herself up to allow Rio to curl into her.</p><p>And Rio did. She exhaled a breath against Agatha’s throat where she’d ducked her head down to be closer. She felt Agatha’s hand seek her bare thigh and she obliged the silent request to lift her leg over her. She should have felt exposed, with everything that had happened between them, wearing just a thin shirt and underwear, with Agatha’s soft touch on her thigh and then her waist, but she didn’t. She felt comforted by Agatha holding her so close. She cuddled in as comfortably and securely as she could, grateful as ever that Agatha ran colder, but already feeling too warm.</p><p>“You weren’t asleep.”</p><p>“I told you I haven’t been sleeping.”</p><p>“Alice’s snoring not help?”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her waist and Rio smiled a little, shifting to press her body more tightly around her. Rio remained still like that for a while, taking the opportunity whilst she had it to breathe in the familiar scent of Agatha Harkness. Only it was different this time. She could smell her own fabric conditioner on her borrowed shirt and the two mingled to form something new, something infinitely better.</p><p>Just as she thought her heart couldn’t take the proximity any longer Agatha spoke again, her soft voice somehow softer, “My flight’s at midday tomorrow. But I can change it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. But she changed her hold, moving the arm that simply rested around Agatha to bend up, to clutch at the back of her collar, to hold her in place.</p><p>She took a breath, breathed that new scent of Agatha in, and then, as much as it hurt she said: “No, you’ve already given up more than enough of your time.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond and so Rio didn’t say anything else. She lay still, holding onto Agatha and breathing her in, hoping she’d just fall asleep. At some point in the minutes that they lay together in the silent room, Agatha’s fingers had moved down to Rio’s hip below her shirt. The pads of her fingers danced across her skin, taking advantage of the access but not pressing for more.</p><p>“You should wear your glasses more often,” Rio breathed out against Agatha’s skin, feeling her breath warm her cheeks as it had no where else to go she was so close.</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“I tried them on. You’re blind. I must just be a blur to you.”</p><p>“A very beautiful blur.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and Agatha shifted a little. She wondered if it was the proximity, that she’d felt uncomfortable from Rio’s face pressing so close, that she’d felt her vibrations and didn’t want to. Or maybe she was too warm. Maybe Agatha wanted her to move.</p><p>She shifted back an inch and Agatha’s hand flexed at her hip, moving to dip fully below her shirt and hold her more securely.</p><p>“Are you too hot?”</p><p>Rio was. She was burning up. But she shook her head and Agatha tucked her arm more round her, making whatever heat Rio was feeling before rise by a couple degrees. But she said nothing as Agatha held her. She kept her eyes closed and focused on breathing her in instead, wondering if it were possible to breathe someone in so deeply that your body could remember them so that when Agatha was gone again she could simply conjure her up once more and live forever with the memory that she’d once been close, that she’d once been held in the arms of God.</p><p>Her mind began to drift as she focused on her breathing, on retaining a memory. Rio wondered if they’d have held each other like this if things hadn’t turned so sour. Or if Agatha would be bolder, more confident, more free. Maybe they’d be naked, for nothing other than to feel the other against their skin. Maybe Agatha would make her come until she passed out, just to help her get some rest. Maybe Rio would allow herself to cry against her. Maybe Agatha would cry with her. Or maybe they’d have both just be able to get some sleep, because Rio felt like she’d lost a part of herself, but Agatha as she had been, as she could have been, would have held her together.</p><p>Rio turned, unable to handle the heat any longer. And Agatha moved in tandem, relinquishing her hold to allow Rio the freedom of movement. Rio moved back up the pillow and Agatha adjusted to press around her from behind.</p><p>It was cautious at first. Then Rio reached for her hand and tugged it more around herself and suddenly Agatha was confident again. She knew how to hold her. She snuck her arm beneath Rio’s head on the pillow and curled her legs behind hers. She pressed her nose in to the back of Rio’s neck and Rio shivered for the feel of her warm breath against her skin after so long of not feeling it.</p><p>“Try and sleep,” Agatha whispered, her nose brushing up gently before she placed a tender kiss to the base of her neck. “I’ll be right here.”</p><p>Rio nodded against the pillow, squeezing her eyes closed as she felt Agatha press her face against her and she knew she was breathing her in still. She wondered if she’d missed the way her skin felt, the way her skin remembered the scent of her perfume even if she’d neglected to wear it for a couple days. She wondered if Agatha were thinking of how they might be if things hadn’t gone so wrong.</p><p>Her thoughts turned to ghosts in her mind as she drifted off, her fingers entwined with Agatha’s as she cradled her hand against her chest.</p><p>When she woke, she woke alone.</p><p>She turned slowly to see if Agatha were even in the room anymore but the cool of the mattress beside her and the empty, still room, told her she was long gone.</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and sat on the edge of the bed. Her head was sore again. She felt heavy all over, the comfort of last night leaving her mind and body with the horror of Agatha having left her without saying goodbye.</p><p>The horror of waking up with a dead dad.</p><p>She grabbed her sweatpants from the side and made a mental note to tidy up her shit spread across the room before her mom saw and got mad.</p><p>Her steps were heavy on the stairs but not heavy enough to drown out the sound of voices coming from the dining room at the back of the little house. She frowned as she rounded the corner and arrived in the doorway and was surprised to see Agatha there back in her suit.</p><p>Only this time there was something noticeably different. She was wearing her glasses. Agatha looked tired but surprisingly relaxed as she sat opposite Alice at the table.</p><p>Rio hesitated in the doorway as Agatha smiled at her and Alice turned to see her. “Hey. Thought you’d sleep through breakfast.”</p><p>“Morning,” Rio said quietly, moving to pull out the chair beside Alice. “Mom made pancakes?”</p><p>“No, Agatha did.”</p><p>Rio looked up and saw Agatha was watching her and she looked away again, deciding pouring herself some coffee from the pot was a good distraction from the intensity of her blue eyes.</p><p>“Mom allowed that?”</p><p>“She loves me.” / “She likes her more than me.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow as she placed the coffee pot down again and heard Alice clear her throat.</p><p>“Where’s my mom?”</p><p>“Kitchen. Your aunt called.”</p><p>“Sleep okay?”</p><p>Rio glanced up at Agatha as she sipped the lukewarm coffee and had to look away again for fear she’d be caught out by Alice. Though she knew Alice had probably already guessed what had happened the night before.</p><p>“Fine. You?” Rio swallowed down another gulp of coffee and silently stabbed a pancake with her fork and brought it to her plate.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Rio glanced up and saw Alice exchange a look with Agatha. “I’m not a zoo animal, I can’t be spooked.”</p><p>“We’re worried,” Alice said softly, watching as Rio cut a piece of pancake with her fork. “They’ve moved the schedule around for you.”</p><p>The piece of pancake floated in the air between the plate and Rio’s mouth. “Alice. Please don’t call in any favours.”</p><p>“Maria wanted to do it,” Agatha said, speaking for the first time since Rio had arrived. “It was all her.”</p><p>Rio swallowed the pancake and was briefly surprised at how fluffy it was, how delicious it tasted with the sweet blueberries baked in.</p><p>She washed it down with the bitter coffee. “I’m not a charity case.”</p><p>“She doesn’t think you are, honey.”</p><p>Rio looked up then, having just put her mug back down. She caught Agatha’s gaze and felt lost in it, momentarily transfixed by the light in her eyes.</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want a couple more days here?”</p><p>Alice’s voice broke the spell and Rio glanced at her friend before she looked back down at her breakfast. “No. Working will take my mind off of it. I need the distraction. How was the schedule changed?”</p><p>“No speaking scenes. You’ll just be needed for reaction shots or background presence.”</p><p>Rio nodded as she stabbed at the pancake, “Okay.”</p><p>She was aware that she was being watched as she continued to eat but she didn’t look up again, too worried she’d make a fool of herself or shout for reasons she couldn’t rationalise even to herself.</p><p>So she kept her gaze down, kept herself eating until the pancake had disappeared and her coffee was gone. She cleared her throat as she reached for more coffee.</p><p>“I’m going to drive Agatha back to her hotel and then take her to the airport.”</p><p>Rio nodded and cleared her throat again as she stretched her arm out to rest on the back of Alice’s chair. She knew Alice was asking her if she was going to come and knew Agatha probably was going to ask the same thing but she couldn’t bring herself to agree.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>But Alice did ask and Rio looked over to her, and was almost swayed. “Are you coming?”</p><p>“No. Best not.”</p><p>She glanced up at Agatha who was looking down at her coffee mug, her hands wrapped around it. Her own gaze fell to it too and she stared at the empty ring finger on her left hand and wondered why Agatha wasn’t wearing her ring anymore.</p><p>“We should get going,” Alice said after a second, turning to look at Agatha too.</p><p>Rio moved her gaze to her empty plate and felt something she hadn’t felt in a while: she was hungry. She hesitated and then reached across and snagged another pancake for her plate.</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio could hear the nervousness in her voice, though maybe Alice couldn’t. “Maybe we can wait. Just a little.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look up but she could feel Agatha’s eyes on Alice, could have drawn the look she was giving her, the look that said: ‘shut up, she’s eating. She’ll be alone if we leave. Let’s stay with her’.</p><p>No one said anything until Rio was done with her second pancake and she’d clattered her fork on the plate.</p><p>“More coffee?”</p><p>She glanced up at the pot Agatha was offering her and shook her head, deciding to leave the lukewarm coffee left in her mug. She stood to leave the table.</p><p>“Rio.” “Honey.”</p><p>Rio stopped in her tracks and looked around at the two people who had just tried to call her back.</p><p>Alice looked concerned but Agatha looked bereft.</p><p>“Alice,” Agatha said, “Can I have a second?”</p><p>Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek and watched the indecision writ large across Alice’s face. She turned to Rio for permission and when Rio nodded she stood, kissed her friend’s cheek, and left.</p><p>“I’ll check on your mom and then wait in the car, okay?”</p><p>Rio smiled as much as she could and waited until Alice had left before she turned to leave after her.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio stopped at the door and held onto the frame, hearing Agatha walk up towards her and stop just behind her.</p><p>“Will you be okay?”</p><p>Closing her eyes Rio gripped the wooden frame and drew in a heavy breath.</p><p>“You’re wearing your glasses.”</p><p>She heard the slight creak in the floorboards where Agatha had moved that bit closer. “You like them.” It wasn’t a question, more a statement of fact. Rio liked them; Agatha wore them.</p><p>“You should wear them if they help you see, not just because of me.”</p><p>She heard Agatha move closer. “It’s only really when I’m tired or for close up if I’m reading a lot.” She took a breath and then: “Will you be okay?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine, Agatha.”</p><p>“I’ll stay, Rio. If you want me to. I’ll stay.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t have come.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha admitted quietly, “But I had to. I couldn’t just…”</p><p>Rio turned then and saw that Agatha was much closer than she expected her to be and she felt sick because of it. And the sickness increased when Agatha moved closer still, and her hands were on her arms, and she was leaning in. Rio swallowed thickly as she backed more into the door frame and saw in Agatha’s wide lenses a vague reflection of her shell of a self.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to her cheek, a gentle, tender kiss that made Rio reach for her and pull at her until Agatha was holding her and Rio was breathing her in again.</p><p>“I want you to stay. I… I want you to stay.”</p><p>Agatha nodded against her temple and Rio frowned as she tightened her hold on Agatha. “But I can’t let you.”</p><p>Rio’s breath was taken away from her as Agatha tightened her hold and she gasped as Agatha pressed into her. Suddenly everything was Agatha, and for a second her body made her mind forget. It was just her and Agatha. Just the two of them.</p><p>But it was over before it begun. Her brain remembered. Her body forgot. Agatha was pulling away and Rio wasn’t able to stop her.</p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked down, focusing somewhere around Agatha’s midsection. Agatha didn’t move for a while and then her lips were back on Rio’s cheek and Rio closed her eyes to not have to witness Agatha pulling away again.</p><p>“Will you call me? If you need me?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was against her cheek still. She hadn’t pulled away.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Kiss me.”</p><p>Rio opened her eyes, and was surprised by what she saw before her. Agatha looked pained suddenly, her brow furrowing and her lips parting slightly. Her blue eyes were wide beneath her glasses and she shook her head just a little, even as her gaze dropped to Rio’s lips. Rio’s heart began to thunder in her chest, so loud she feared Agatha could hear it, would be horrified to know how much Rio wanted this, needed it even.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha exhaled her name, breathed it out like a prayer.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes again and waited, waited for Agatha to leave or to laugh. But she didn’t.</p><p>Instead, she whispered, “Rio, I can’t do that.”</p><p>She hadn’t been expecting the softness. A rejection, maybe. A loud, purposeful “NO”, but not the tenderness of Agatha’s sigh, the sadness laced in every syllable.</p><p>She opened her eyes again and she looked across at Agatha, saw the way she looked up at her beneath hooded, frowning eyes. “Not while you’re grieving. I can’t.”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“My love,” Agatha breathed out, now changing her hold to lift Rio’s face, watching her in the way she did sometimes when it looked like she was cherishing her. “It wouldn’t be right. I want us to be right. I want-…"</p><p>“I asked you to.”</p><p>Agatha went silent and it was Rio who ducked her head and tried to lean in but Agatha had a hold on her and Agatha wouldn’t let her.</p><p>“Please?” Rio whimpered quietly, mortified to hear herself begging as Agatha just continued to watch her with those sad baby blues.</p><p>“I love you. I love you so much and I wish… but Rio, I can’t. Not while you’re so early in your grief. I don’t want you to want it just because…”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, felt the steady brush of Agatha’s thumbs along her pink cheeks and lifted her hands to wrap around her wrists. It was too mortifying to stand, too mortifying to look at Agatha.</p><p>She felt her lean in and kiss her cheek again, misplacing her thumb to do so.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s lips still nudged at her cheek and so Rio didn’t respond, only kept close, kept her eyes closed.</p><p>“I need to go, okay? I… I need to go.”</p><p>Rio nodded and kept her eyes closed because seeing Agatha leave wasn’t something she could handle. But another precious kiss was suddenly pressed to her cheek and Rio whimpered quietly for it, and for a brief moment, Rio forgot her dad was dead, and thought only of Agatha.</p><p>Fully hers, fully soft, fully ready and willing to simply hold Rio through it. To kiss her pain away until it was numbed and she could breathe again.</p><p>But Agatha pulled away again and Rio didn’t look.</p><p>She let Agatha walk away, heard her reach the hall and then she followed her out and grabbed her arm as she went to open the door. “Wait. Just… wait.”</p><p>She ran, taking the stairs two at a time and, when back in her little bedroom, she peeled off the shirt she’d slept in - the gift Agatha had brought her, her favourite cowboy shirt. She folded it, replaced it with a nearby, discarded sweater over herself and then ran back to Agatha.</p><p>She found her exactly where she’d left her and, panting softly, she held up the shirt she hadn’t even bothered to fold.</p><p>It seemed stupid now, juvenile, even. That she was giving Agatha Harkness, the most famous, most talented of them all, a crumpled up cowboy shirt that she’d been wearing all night. But Agatha took it from her, and looked down at it like it was precious.</p><p>“I can’t take this, Rio. I gave it back to you to-…”</p><p>“Take it. Take it back. It’s yours now.”</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly and swooped in to wrap her arms around Rio, making her gasp, making her whimper. It felt good just to be held by her again, just to be pressed so closely they became one person. One ever-living, ever-breathing thing.</p><p>But Alice outside beeped her horn and Rio began to pull away so Agatha could go out to her. Agatha hovered for a second, she hovered and she kissed Rio’s cheek again and held her close.</p><p>“Call me. Please. Whatever you need.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her cheek again, this time her kiss was softer, the tip of her nose now trailing a path until it collided with Rio’s and Rio tried again, she turned her head and raised her chin only to find Agatha retreating.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispered as her eyes fluttered open and she felt strong hands slide from her hips to hold her over her ribs. “I’m sorry. You said no.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighed out, her breath tickling Rio’s lips as she spoke, “You have no idea how badly I…” Rio shifted a little, but Agatha moved too, and the distance between them remained. “I’ve fucked everything up. Let me do this right. At least this.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t find the words to say to tell Agatha that the only thing that felt right was that she wanted to kiss her, was that she <em>needed</em> to. But they were taking things slow. They were being steady for each other and Rio knew, in the deepest caverns of her heart, that kissing Agatha couldn’t relieve the pain of losing her dad.</p><p>So she agreed, she found the words that meant she wanted Agatha forever, not just for now, and she breathed them into the distance between them: “Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha pulled away. She left the house and down the path to the sidewalk she kept looking back, she kept checking on Rio, or checking if she’d follow her, Rio didn’t know. But she turned every two steps. She turned around with that same look of pain on her face, that same concern.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath as Agatha got into Alice’s car and she felt her chest expand with it, her lungs ache with the push of it.</p><p>She stood in the doorway to her parents’, no, her mom’s house, and watched as Agatha and Alice disappeared. She turned back then, closed the door, and found herself alone.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Alice was gone for almost an hour and in that time Rio felt what it truly was to be alone. Anna found her sitting in her room after hanging up from her sister and held her until Alice came to take over.</p><p>Rio didn’t cry but she didn’t say anything either. Her head was all over the place: with Miguel, with Agatha.</p><p>The only thing she did was spin a crumpled piece of paper around and around in her hands. It span like her washing machine mind. Round and round and round.</p><p>She lost herself in the paper petals.</p><p>Neither Alice nor Anna asked why or what it was.</p><p>But Rio didn’t let it go all morning. When she eventually showered she left it on the side and picked it up only after she’d dried herself enough to not let it dissolve into mush. By lunchtime, Alice had grown too curious and asked: “What is that?”</p><p>Rio had only answered: “A gift.”</p><p>Leaving Anna was the hardest thing she’d ever had to do. When she’d left before, after three days of grieving together, she’d had the knowledge that she’d be back soon. But when she left now, she had only a gruelling shooting schedule to face into, and no family around her.</p><p>But Alice was family. And Alice held her hand the whole way to the airport where she had another little gift waiting for her.</p><p>Paps.</p><p>The paps had found her, or followed her, or scouted her out. There were five in total, though Rio didn’t bother much to count.</p><p>They all shouted for her but she kept her face down, kept her cap tugged tightly over her brow, kept her hand firm in Alice’s.</p><p>“They were here for Agatha too. At one point I thought she was going to swing for one of them,” Alice was saying as they took their seats at the Gate. She looked stressed, looked tense, and Rio could only squeeze her hand in reassurance as she said: "Fucking vultures. I thought they'd have some fucking decency. Leave you alone, you know? Who stalks a grieving woman?!".</p><p>Rio nodded but said nothing and only continued to toy with Alice’s smaller fingers. She was frowning down at them, wondering how the press had found her in her hometown. But then again, two Oscar winners arriving to a funeral in the suburbs of Wilmington was probably the opposite of a slow news day for the city.</p><p>“How was she? When you left with her?”</p><p>“We didn’t speak.”</p><p>“At all?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio looked up suddenly, blinked stupidly into the face of a stranger who was smiling hopefully down at her.</p><p>“I’m so sorry for your loss.”</p><p>Rio tried to breathe, really she did. But the breath was stolen from her lungs as the next sentence came out of this stranger’s mouth. “Can I get a selfie?”</p><p>“I think not,” Alice spat, and Rio knew she wanted to add a curse in there too but had held herself back. “We’re not doing-…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio gasped out, already making to stand up on her wobbly legs. “A quick one, sure.”</p><p>Alice muttered something indecipherable as Rio lifted her chin and forced a smile on her face. In the little phone screen she saw her pale face and her dull eyes. She’d never looked less like herself and she marvelled at the idea that anyone would want to keep this momento of her. She was a ghost. And she hated ghosts.</p><p>“Thank you so much!”</p><p>Arms were flung around her neck before she could stop them and Rio stumbled a little, but the woman was attached to her so followed as she did. “Hey!” She heard Alice shout from beside her but not knowing what to do she tentatively tapped the stranger’s back. “Sure.”</p><p>A gentle tug on her jacket helped Rio to pull away and the stranger just beamed as Rio could barely keep her smile on her face.</p><p>“You’re being filmed,” Alice muttered to her as she sat back down, now with Alice’s arm securely around her shoulders. Rio didn’t look up after that. She kept her head down, kept her eyes on the hand she’d stolen back to hold and held her breath until their flight was called for boarding.</p><p>A couple years ago, when everything was beginning to pick up fame-wise, Miguel had asked Rio what it felt like to be known everywhere she went. At the time she’d said something akin to “oh, like nothing at all!”. But even then she’d known it was a lie.</p><p>Fame felt like a cage that kept getting smaller. It felt like Rio were trapped and no one was listening. Even when she screamed.</p><p>Her dad had listened. Her mom listened. Alice sometimes listened. Agatha didn’t need to listen. She just knew.</p><p>Agatha had been in cages all her life and Rio’s, well hers was new. Hers was decorated with gold and starlight. But it was still a cage.</p><p>They boarded the plane. Rio with her invisible cage around her still, her hand between the bars holding Alice’s. People looked her way as she went to her seat but she ignored them all and sat with her eyes aimed down.</p><p>“Cuando regresemos, ¿puedo usar tu teléfono para llamarla?” <em>When we get back, can I use your phone to call her?</em></p><p>Alice shifted beside her and Rio bit on her lip. “Why not on your cell?”</p><p>“I haven’t… I haven’t checked it since…”</p><p>“Okay,” Alice said quickly, “okay, okay, of course.”</p><p>They remained silent for the rest of the flight. Rio slept. Sleeping was escaping so she forced it upon herself. Alice guarded her throughout, unable or unwilling to let anyone get any sneaky pictures of the grieving Oscar Winner if she could help it.</p><p>Landing in LAX brought with it more fuss and more paparazzi. Rio held onto the peak of her Celtics cap and kept her head down, and when they made it out to the car she breathed again. Heavy, slow breaths helped to calm her racing heart as it rattled in her ribcage.</p><p>“They’re getting fucking worse,” Alice muttered as she fished in her purse for her phone.</p><p>Rio said nothing as she accepted it and tapped in Alice’s passcode before finding Agatha’s contact. She ignored the plethora of notifications Alice had everywhere. Her inbox had an angry 1,789 in a red circle and her WhatsApp read an egregious 131.</p><p>She hated that every word in each of those messages would be related to her.</p><p>Ignoring the noise, she opened up Alice’s contacts and pressed Agatha’s name.</p><p>It took two dial tones before she answered.</p><p>“Alice? What’s wrong? Is she-…?”</p><p>“It’s me.”</p><p>The line went silent for a few seconds and Rio frowned as she stared straight ahead, twirling her hair around her finger.</p><p>And then: “Rio.”</p><p>“I just-…” / “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine, a slight headache but…” Rio swallowed, “I just wanted to call and… thank you for coming.”</p><p>Silence again. Movement.</p><p>“Nicky’s here. Do you want to come over? We’ll come and get you.”</p><p>“No, I just wanted to thank you, that’s all.”</p><p>Another few seconds of silence. “Rio? Is Alice staying with you tonight?”</p><p>“No. I’m sending her home.”</p><p>“I’m coming to get you.”</p><p>Rio laughed, her eyes closing as if they couldn’t bear the sound. “I’m fine, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha was silent again and Rio took a few deep breaths before she said, “Anyway. I’ll let you get back to Nicky.”</p><p>“My love,” Agatha sighed, “<em>Rio</em>. Can we please come and get you?”</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly when Alice came into view. “No, really. I’m fine. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Rio, wait. Will you call me tonight? If you need me?”</p><p>Rio nodded and then shortly after said, “Sure.”</p><p>“I mean it, Rio. Call me. Whenever. I wish… I wish I could take the pain away. I wish I could feel it for you. I… <em>Rio</em>, please let me come and get you.”</p><p>Rio rubbed at her temple and felt a familiar sting as tears threatened to fall. “Agatha,” she choked out, “I’m fine.” Maybe if she said it often enough she eventually would be.</p><p>Agatha sighed quietly, “Did the paps get you?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Me too. Jen’s already called to try and keep your face out of the press. I don’t know how much it’ll help but…”</p><p>“Agatha, I’m fine. It’s fine. These things happen.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>. They don’t get to profit off your grief, Rio. That’s not how-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, finding Alice’s hand as it rested on her leg, “Give Nicky a hug from me, okay? I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>Silence. One beat. Two. “Call me,” Agatha said in that soft tone again, “Please call.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio hung up.</p><p>She returned the phone to her manager and said nothing for the duration of the trip, just listening to the soft pad of Alice’s left thumb as it tapped away at her screen.</p><p>Back home, the quiet house in the hills felt larger than usual and strangely empty. Rio made up for it by draping herself in a heavy sweater and stealing her biggest and comfiest blanket for the couch. She curled in on herself and buried most of her body as snugly as she could just just her head was visible, the rest of her swaddled beneath.</p><p>She called her mom as soon as she was comfortable enough. Just to check in. Just to make sure she was still there, still alive, that she still had one, living, breathing parent.</p><p>Alice had been busy texting or emailing or messaging someone somewhere about Rio so they hadn’t spoken for a while. And after speaking to Anna, Rio was beginning to slip into the embrace of sleep when Alice finally broke the silence.</p><p>“I’m going to suggest something, okay? And I… don’t want you to freak out.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, her eyes down on the floor. “What, Alice?”</p><p>“Why don’t you… call up one of your friends and…”</p><p>Rio frowned into the dimly lit room, her brain bouncing about through a list of names as she tried to make sense of what Alice was saying.</p><p>“Gotta get under someone to get over someone, you know?”</p><p>Slowly, and blinking into the light, Rio sat up. She stared at her best friend who was doing everything she could to not look at her. “Are you suggesting if I have sex I’ll forget that my dad just died?”</p><p>“I-… no, I mean, yes, I mean… I know that’s not exactly what that phrase means but… it’ll take your mind off of it. Just for a couple hours. Just until you-…”</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>“Okay! Okay!” Alice stood with a huff and her hands held up in surrender, “Just a suggestion.”</p><p>“Yeah the most fucking stupid suggestion I’ve ever heard!”</p><p>Alice grimaced and turned away as Rio continued to stare aghast at her. It was clear she knew she was in trouble because she didn’t look around again for a while until she eventually tried, “Would Agatha maybe-…?”</p><p>Rio scoffed and threw herself from the couch, struggling for a while with the blanket. “Holy shit, Alice. Did you get high or something when I wasn’t looking?”</p><p>Her legs took her to the kitchen and her hands found the tequila before she could think much about it.</p><p>“It’ll get you out of your head. Hell, I’d offer if it weren’t for Jen and if you could get me drunk enough!”</p><p>“Fuck off, Alice.”</p><p>“Listen to me,” Alice was in the room now, hovering somewhere nearby but Rio was too busy pouring to care much about how close she was or what she had to say. “I’m trying to help. You hate being alone. You like attention.”</p><p>Rio slammed the tequila bottle down and in the near future she’d just be grateful her right hand had done it rather than her left - the glass with a healthy pour now in it would have surely smashed into pieces. “She wouldn’t fucking kiss me. Okay?! Wouldn’t kiss me. I don’t <em>want</em> anyone else. I want <em>her</em> and she wouldn’t kiss me. She just looked at me like-…”</p><p>Alice was behind her now, trying to make her turn.</p><p>“She looked at me like I was going to break. Like I…” she turned and found soft hands on her wet cheeks, “like I <em>was</em> broken and Alice… Alice I promised I could carry her. I promised… I…”</p><p>“Babe,” Alice said shakily, her own tears beginning to fall as she watched her friend disintegrate before her eyes, “I-… I know it hurts. God I know it hurts so fucking much, Rio. Try to breathe. Just breathe for me.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut and felt her body being pulled into Alice’s smaller one. She felt the press of her lips against her temple. She felt the tug at the back of her sweater and the soft pull into a warm body.</p><p>She felt everything and nothing, all at once. She was alone even when Alice was there, even as she clung to her. It was unbearable, the loneliness. Living in a world where her dad wasn’t was impossible.</p><p>She sank into Alice and together they clutched and clung and slipped onto the floor. Together they cried. Together they grieved the loss of a father and a father figure. But Rio, Rio held as tight as she could but still felt adrift, unanchored to even the woman who wouldn’t let go.</p><p>“I can call her,” Alice said after an hour of being on the floor. They were now beside each other, Rio’s hand tangled in Alice’s, her other clutching her empty tequila glass. “I’ll get her to come over.”</p><p>“No. She has Nicky.”</p><p>“Clean yourself up and he can come too.”</p><p>Rio scoffed quietly, “He can’t see me like this, Alice.”</p><p>Her hand was empty suddenly and Rio blinked at it, wondering what had just happened that meant she was now staring at her own palm.</p><p>“That kid,” Alice said suddenly, shocking Rio into looking up, “loves you. He adores you. And I don’t fucking like-…” Alice huffed and pressed the heels of her hands into her temple, “Actually I think she’s a jumped up fucking-… <em>god</em> but that kid, Rio. He fucking adores you and you adore him and… and if you asked then-…”</p><p>“I can’t see him, Alice.” Rio sighed heavily, choosing now to look at her empty glass rather than her empty hand, “He deserves me when I can be my best. Not when I’m-…”</p><p>“Look,” Alice huffed, “I don’t fucking trust her but if she didn’t kiss you then… then maybe she’s better than I thought.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, “didn’t you just want me to-…?”</p><p>“A recreational fuck not to make love or to, I don’t know, build a house together or some shit. But… shit I can’t believe I’m saying this but… her showing up was, fuck Rio it was romantic as hell. Her not kissing you? When you’re grieving your dad? Fuck me. Just… fuck me.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and lifted her sleeves to wipe roughly at her eyes, “I can’t have her see me like this. Her or Nicky. Don’t. Don’t call her.”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice elongated her name, making the two syllables double as she spread the ‘o’ like a sigh.</p><p>“You know she wants to kiss you. You know she wants-…”</p><p>But Rio was standing already, grabbing the tequila from the side and marching back to the living room.</p><p>“Babe! I don’t fucking like her. I don’t trust her with you and I don’t think she’s fucking-…” Alice released a scream of frustration as Rio simply poured her drink, knocking back half of it before she’d even sat on the couch. “I’m not saying it happens often but maybe I’m wrong. Maybe she is good for you. Maybe she’s-…”</p><p>“Stop it, Alice. I asked her to kiss me and she refused.”</p><p>“Did she also sleep with you all night? Hold you? Tell your cousin she loved you and wanted to keep you safe? You and her son? Rio. Get a grip, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Rio knocked the rest of her tequila back and looked up as Alice’s phone lit up on the coffee table. ‘AGATHA’ came up on the screen and she felt her battered heart fizzle in her chest, broken as it still was. Alice was nearer now, frowning down at her, but she caught the phone light too and picked it up before Rio could tell her not to.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio swallowed.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m here.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her hands, flexing each finger one at a time.</p><p>“No, I, I asked her. Agatha, I-…”</p><p>Rio turned her hands over, beginning the same the other way, “No, she’s… no. Agatha, I’ll call you later, okay?”</p><p>Rio sighed and closed her eyes.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha, look.”</p><p>Rio blindly reached her hand out and a second later felt the weight of the cell in her hand. “It’s me.”</p><p>She heard Agatha inhale, “Rio. I’m coming. Alice hasn’t been answering my calls and she doesn’t sound-…”</p><p>“Don’t. Please. I can’t have Nicky see.”</p><p>She heard a voice in the background, “Jen’s here, honey. He’ll stay with her and-…”</p><p>“I can’t, Agatha. Please. Not tonight. Please.”</p><p>“Quiero estar allí. Quiero verte. Quiero abrazarte. Por favor.” <em>I want to be there with you. I want to see you. I want to hold you. Please.</em></p><p>Rio couldn’t believe she was saying no again but she shook her head, pressed her fingers against her chest and sucked in a breath as she said “No, Agatha.”</p><p>There was a different sound in the background and Rio heard something muffle the receiver and then she was back and she was saying, “Can I come see you tomorrow? Before work? I’ll come to your trailer. I’ll bring breakfast. Whatever you want. Get Alice to tell Jen and I’ll bring it. Homemade, store bought, whatever.”</p><p>“<em>Whatever</em> I want?”</p><p>A crack appeared in the form of a smile as Agatha said in a soft voice, “Anything. But, Rio, call me. I’m right here. I’m waiting for your call, okay? Whenever you need me. Jen’s staying so… if you need me to come I will.”</p><p>“Is that something I need to break to Alice?”</p><p>The crack widened and Rio’s face practically split in two as Agatha responded with: “She’s little. You can handle her.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and looked across at her little friend. “She is pretty little.” Alice scowled.</p><p>“Not much taller than Nicky.”</p><p>“He’ll grow though.”</p><p>“He’s made you a card, you know. Wrote it himself. Didn’t even ask for any help. If you don’t keep it up on your fridge then you’ll be answering to someone a lot bigger than Alice.”</p><p>“A lot? Jen?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and Rio bit down on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>They were both silent for a few seconds before Agatha asked: “You sure I can’t come over? Just for a little while?”</p><p>Rio sighed out, letting all the air leave her lungs before she slowly brought it back in. “Waffles. With chocolate and banana. But the proper kind. Not the sauce. Proper melted chocolate. Milk.”</p><p>“People don’t usually say no to me, you know.”</p><p>“Did you get all that? I can repeat it if-…”</p><p>“Waffles with proper melted milk chocolate and banana. And a definite no on me coming over?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and shook her head, “I’m going to get drunk and fall asleep on Alice.”</p><p>“On?”</p><p>“With.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Rio raised her brows as she waited for her words. “Fine. Call me though. If you… if you want someone to sleep <em>on</em>.”</p><p>“You’ll allow that but… I can’t kiss you?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath and Rio chewed on her lip, suddenly twisting her hair desperately.</p><p>“It’s different, Rio.”</p><p>“Is it off the table? Completely?”</p><p>“No. I… no. Never. Just… no, you know it isn’t.”</p><p>Rio nodded and went silent as she span her hair around and around.</p><p>“Let’s talk tomorrow? Over waffles?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Go easy on the tequila.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and then said, “Okay.”</p><p>She handed the phone back to Alice before Agatha could say anything else and watched as she held the phone to her ear the brought it down again. “She hung up. So. I’m staying here?”</p><p>“Looking after me whilst I’m drunk, yes.”</p><p>“You’re working tomorrow.”</p><p>“I’m in the background of a Christmas movie. I can be hungover.”</p><p>“There’s buzz about this, you know. There’s-…”</p><p>“Alice I could not give two shits about awards right now.”</p><p>“I know, I know. Sorry.” Alice leant forwards and poured Rio a much smaller glass than she’d been pouring herself.</p><p>Rio smiled a little and toasted before she knocked back the clear liquid that burned her throat. “I should have kissed her the night we… the night before dad. Maybe then she’d be here. She’d kiss me and it wouldn’t hurt as much. Or, or would still hurt the same but she’d be kissing me which… which is better.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you?”</p><p>Rio reached for the bottle again and doubled the previous pour. She blinked before she sipped and felt the fluffiness that came with the promise of impending insobriety.</p><p>“I wanted to make sure I was ready. I wanted to make sure I-… that I would be strong for her. That I could take a night to sleep on it and in the morning I’d kiss her in that damn trailer. That I’d have one last night alone preparing for a life with her. And then-…” she shook her head and knocked back the rest of her drink.</p><p>Alice, during this time, had picked up the bottle so Rio couldn’t fill her glass so quickly. “I just want her, Alice.”</p><p>“And Nicky?”</p><p>“And Nicky.”</p><p>Alice nodded slowly and Rio tapped her nails along the thin glass. It sounded like bells.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio sniffed quietly and wiped the underside of her nose with the back of her hand.</p><p>“So, in two weeks he’s served. That’s, what? Six months? Six months until she’s single and, custody, Rio, you know that might take longer.”</p><p>Rio nodded, the bells still sounding.</p><p>“It’s a long time to-…”</p><p>“I’ll wait. However long it takes.”</p><p>She reached for the bottle and Alice reluctantly gave it over. “And you trust her?”</p><p>“She told me everything. She told me-…” Rio shook her head as she poured the tequila, mentally cutting herself off after this one.</p><p>“I told my dad. Alice I told him I was hopeful. I told him. I told him… to expect her and Nicky at Christmas.”</p><p>Rio hiccuped suddenly but she didn’t know whether it was the alcohol or the sobs trapped somewhere in her diaphragm.</p><p>Alice moved in again and pulled Rio against her. In her hold now she still felt alone. Still felt adrift, unmoored, floating.</p><p>But Alice held on until she felt a little less of it. She kissed her head and ran her fingers through her short hair until Rio was saying something she’d been keeping in since the news broke: “I’m worried I killed him.”</p><p>She felt rather than heard Alice suck in a sharp breath and she pulled up to look round at her. In her friend’s eyes she saw only pity.</p><p>“Rio, that just isn’t true.”</p><p>“All week, Alice. Longer than. I called him every day and-…”</p><p>“And he loved hearing from you. You think your dad wasn’t <em>thrilled</em> that his little girl needed him? Rio, that man loved speaking to you, he loved you so much. Your mom told me how excited he was that night. How <em>hopeful</em> he was.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and looked away, chewing the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“I should have called him everyday. Even when I had nothing to tell him.”</p><p>“He loved you anyway. I’ve never seen a prouder man than when you won the Oscar. Than when he saw the way Agatha looked at you when you came back from winning. Rio, he <em>loved you endlessly</em>. And that last call… you sent him to sleep happy.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a shaking breath as Alice whispered, “He died happy, Rio. He… he loved you so much.”</p><p>Alice was right, somewhere, a tiny part of her knew she was. But the grief still felt endless. After all, a single buoy in an endless ocean was no salvation.</p><p>Rio allowed herself to be taken to bed and when she washed her face and brushed her teeth she heard Alice on the phone but she didn’t question it. She didn’t know who she was talking to or what she was saying. She assumed Jen, she hoped Agatha.</p><p>By the time she was in bed, curled inwards on herself and buried beneath the blankets, she felt exhausted. Alice held her hand an after a few moments of silence she'd said into the dark room: "I'm sorry about what I suggested earlier. I know it isn't that simple. When I lost mom I was too young to understand and I know all grief is different but... maybe it was easier for me to lose her so young. I didn't know what it was to love her then. I just did, you know?"</p><p>Rio shifted where she lay and turned to look at her friend in the darkness.</p><p>"What I mean to say is, I'm sorry. I have my own issues with Agatha and... encouraging you to sleep with anyone, including her, isn't going to help you." Rio shifted a little again, squeezed Alice's hand. "Anyway. I lied earlier. I told her in the car I'd kill her if she broke your heart again." </p><p>Rio leant up and pressed a kiss to Alice's temple and in doing so all was forgiven. She turned away then and after a while, she drifted off into a fitful sleep.</p><p>She woke a couple hours later with an arm thrown over her stomach and soft breathing against her temple. She was on her back now, frowning against waking. The arm around her moved and a warm hand hit her abdomen and rubbed it gently.</p><p>Her head turned and she felt the breath she’d felt against her skin closer this time, whispering across her lips. In her sleepy haze she blinked her eyes open and saw deep pools of dark blue looking back at her.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Don’t be scared,” Agatha said gently, as if there were a world where Rio would ever be frightened of this woman. She nudged their noses together and Rio made a soft noise at the contact. “Go back to sleep, Rio.”</p><p>It must be a dream, she thought. It was Alice in the bed with her. Little Alice with her snoring and her propensity to take up as much space in the bed as she could manage.</p><p>Sighing away her fantasies she allowed sleep to creep in, slowly, starting along the edges of her consciousness. The pressure of a hand across her stomach felt fuzzy now, with sleep stealing the strength of it.</p><p>The warmth of soft breath across her face felt like a lullaby to a fading mind. Rio fell asleep with the comfort of someone waiting for her, someone ready to soothe her if waking came again.</p><p>Rio remained peacefully asleep for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p><p>In the morning, Alice was nowhere to be found. The bed was cool beside her and the side Alice had slept on remained surprisingly neat, as if she’d not been in the bed at all.</p><p>She traipsed downstairs and huffed with every step she took. Her head hurt. A dull, familiar throb.</p><p>“Morning, sunshine!”</p><p>Rio grunted and made for the coffee pot before she even looked Alice’s way.</p><p>“Sleep okay?”</p><p>Rio grunted again as she poured out the much-needed elixir and sighed after taking a big sip that burnt her tongue.</p><p>“You didn’t snore last night. So better than I usually would.”</p><p>Alice laughed behind her and Rio turned to raise her brows expectantly at her, her mood descending so suddenly it even took her by surprise.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Good to know Agatha doesn’t snore.”</p><p>Rio blinked and stepped closer, only to slop the hot coffee down her white pyjama top. She cursed and hissed as the warm fabric soaked her chest and she tugged frantically at it to flap away the heat.</p><p>“Shit. What?”</p><p>“She said you woke up. You don’t remember?”</p><p>Rio was too busy flapping to catch the amusement in Alice’s tone. Which was for the best because her head was still thumping and her shirt was still soaked through.</p><p>“Alice. She was here? I… what?”</p><p>Rio’s coffee-brown shirt was a lost cause now and Rio grimaced as she looked to Alice, a mixture of indignity and confusion. “<em>Alice</em>.”</p><p>Her friend sighed and shrugged her sweater from her shoulders to throw it across to Rio. Rio turned as Alice spoke and replaced her wet shirt with the dry sweater.</p><p>“I called her after you fell asleep. You were that twitchy way you get when you don’t sleep well. She came over immediately. Actually,” Rio turned around, now in dry clothes, “she answered after one ring. And she must have broken a few traffic laws because-…”</p><p>“Agatha was here?”</p><p>The hand on her stomach. Alice would never have held her like that.</p><p>The brush of her nose. Alice wouldn’t sleep that close.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p><em>Agatha.</em></p><p>“She had an early call time so had to leave before you woke up but she stayed all night. I’m not sure she slept though.”</p><p>Rio sighed so heavily it turned into a groan as she pressed the heels of her palms into her eyes. “I thought I dreamt it. Dreamt <em>her</em>.”</p><p>“So you <em>do</em> remember?”</p><p>“I remember waking and thinking she was there but… I was so tired. I was drunk still probably. I didn’t know.”</p><p>Warm hands curled around her wrists and Rio could see again and what she saw was a sad facsimile of her usually smiling friend. Alice looked genuinely distraught and it made Rio’s head thump more readily.</p><p>“Hey, breakfast, remember? You’ll see her at breakfast. I… Rio, go take a shower and I’ll have coffee ready for when you’re done.”</p><p>Rio did as she was told and thought only of the woman who’d left her house in the middle of the night to slip into her bed and hold her in her sleep. She wondered if Agatha had slept at all and hoped only that she had, that she’d managed to rest, that she had taken as much comfort from the act as Rio had.</p><p>As had been the habit since Miguel died, Rio and Alice didn’t speak on the car ride to the lot. Rio was too in her head still, too enmeshed in her pain. Nothing Alice could say would pull her from it so she didn’t try.</p><p>When they got to Rio’s trailer, with Rio giving the bare minimum in terms of greetings and smiles to the few members of the crew they passed on their way, it was back into the new routine.</p><p>Rio curled up on the couch, she read her sides for the day, checked over call times, and then threw one of the mini basketballs in the air, bothering Alice with the repetitive noise of it being caught.</p><p>It was quiet. It was miserable.</p><p>Thirty minutes after their arrival and a hundred toss ups later, there was a knock at the door. Rio didn’t miss a beat of the rhythm she’d developed but Alice jumped and went to rip the door open and shouted a very un-Alice-like: “Agatha!”</p><p>Rio’s head turned and the small plastic ball fell onto her face.</p><p>Agatha was standing in the doorway to her trailer holding a tray piled high with waffles and little bowls of fruit. Rio saw her glance at Alice and then hone in on her.</p><p>As Rio sat up properly Agatha placed the tray gently down on the coffee table before her and with tired eyes she looked up and said: “Waffles. Real melted chocolate. Banana.”</p><p>Rio forced herself to look away from Agatha and instead to look down at the tray. In amongst the food, exactly as Rio had requested it, was a single stem of what Rio knew to be Hummingbird Sage.</p><p>She reached for it as Alice spoke for the first time since she’d shouted Agatha’s arrival. “Are you staying?</p><p>“No, I need to head to set. I’m already late.”</p><p>Rio was turning the flower over in her hands, watching the bright pink petals as they wiggled with every movement. Her eyes darted back to the tray and on it, below where the flower had been, she saw a card waiting for her and on the envelope in a child’s handwriting was the word ‘Melliza’.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath as Agatha needlessly explained: “It’s from Nicky. He’s desperate to see you but… I said just a card for now. Maybe soon.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond and only opened the envelope to view the card in question.</p><p>The card turned out to be homemade; a piece of A4 paper folded in half. On the front it had a pencil drawing of two people with brown hair, one holding a basketball and both with big, identical grins. It was clear that the two illustrations of happy Celtics players were in fact Rio and Nicky, smiling from the centre of a big green heart.</p><p>“God that kid is <em>not</em> an artist.”</p><p>Rio slapped Alice’s arm before she traced her finger along the smaller Nicky on the paper and looked up at Agatha who was watching her carefully. “Still definitely not a Bulls fan?”</p><p>“Definitely not.”</p><p>Rio laughed and Agatha’s lips twitched a little but she didn’t yet break a smile. Rio soon looked back down again and opened the card to read Nicky’s message.</p><p>‘Rio,</p><p>Siento mucho lo de tu papá. Él fue muy amable conmigo y me gustó su risa.</p><p>Ven a jugar pronto. Te extraño.</p><p>Con cariño, Nicky.’</p><p><em>I am very sorry about your dad. He was very nice to me and I liked his laugh.</em></p><p><em>Come play soon. I miss you.</em></p><p><em>Love from, Nicky.</em></p><p>Rio looked up, and saw Agatha gnawing on her lower lip as she waited for her response. Alice gave hers first: “Well he’s better at spelling than-…”</p><p>“He wrote it himself. Came up with the words. Just needed help with the spelling. He wants to get better at Spanish so I’ve got him a tutor. He wants to talk to you when no one else can.”</p><p>Rio was ignoring Alice, looking only at Agatha, who looked nervous suddenly, like she’d said too much. She looked terrified and unsure and she broke eye contact only to look down at the card and motion as she said: “Look at the back.”</p><p>Doing as she was told, she turned the card around and saw another green heart, smaller this time. Inside it were the initials: N, A, R.</p><p>Below that Nicky had signed his artwork with a scribbled “Nicholas River Harkness” in the bottom corner.</p><p>Alice was silent this time.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said quietly. In her peripheral vision she saw Alice move and in front of her Agatha shuffled on the spot.</p><p>She folded the card back over and stood, keeping her eyes on the floor. Only when she’d made it over to Agatha did she look up again. Agatha was looking down at the card held by her side and her lip was tugged back and chewed so hungrily that it looked like it might be sore. Rio reached for it, cradling Agatha’s chin as her thumb encouraged her to release, to relax her jaw.</p><p>She kissed her cheek and Agatha’s hand found her hip as she turned into her little.</p><p>The door opened and neither jumped back but Rio slowly pulled away to look at the arrived Jennifer and found Agatha’s arms snake around her, her temple resting against her cheek as she held her close.</p><p>She took in a deep breath and allowed herself to press her nose into Agatha’s hair and breathe her in, closing her eyes into the embrace.</p><p>“Interrupting something?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said calmly as she sucked in a steadying breath. She felt strong when with her, strongest of all when touching her. No longer unmoored, simply, tethered. “No. Just breakfast.”</p><p>Jennifer eyed her suspiciously before her eyes flickered to Agatha and she announced: “If the <em>koala</em> could let you go for a second then we need to get you to set.”</p><p>Rio said nothing, deciding she’d only let go when Agatha did. But far from being released she was instead being told in the form of a close whisper: “She’s just pissed she can’t cling to Alice all day.”</p><p>This made Rio smile, made her turn her head more into Agatha, made her so dazzled by her gaze that she missed Jen approaching and tugging Agatha back a few inches. “Hey. Work. Let’s go.”</p><p>Agatha looked briefly pissed but schooled her face and slapped Jen away to remove herself from her grasp. “They won’t start without me.”</p><p>“That isn’t the point.”</p><p>Rio was looking back down at the card again rather than focusing in on the argument before her and opened it up to read Nicky’s message once more as she felt a kiss to her cheek and shortly after another but from a different pair of lips.</p><p>“I’m here too,” Jen said in an infinitely softer tone than the one she’d just been using on Agatha. “If you need anything.”</p><p>Rio looked up and managed to smile at Jennifer who did look, at least as far as Rio could tell, genuine in her offer. By the door Agatha stood waiting for her, that same look of concern on her face again, that same hesitance that appeared every time she left Rio now.</p><p>They looked at each other but said nothing as Jen slipped out of the trailer after kissing Alice and Agatha soon followed behind.</p><p>With the door closed and Rio and Alice now alone again Rio went to sit back down and ignored the waffles in favour of placing the stem of magenta flowers in a cup of water on the table.</p><p>“I know what I said last night,” Alice said cautiously as she moved over to crouch before the table and get in Rio’s sightline. “About not trusting her. And I don’t. I don’t know if I ever will. But it <em>is</em> clear that she loves you. So, I’m no Miguel, but I’ll trust <em>you</em> enough for the both of you, okay?”</p><p>Rio placed the card down and rubbed over her face, letting her fingers cover her mouth as she processed for a second before she spoke: “I think we’ll be okay, Alice. Don’t you?”</p><p>Alice seemed lost for words for a while, deep in the tranches of her mistrust and her desire to soothe rather than scare. Eventually she nodded.</p><p>“You’ll be fine.”</p><p>Rio hid her face again, and the morning went on as quietly and as miserably as it always did. She wasn’t called to set at any point, just left to linger. She was Miss Havisham in black leggings and a  band tee.</p><p>After a couple hours of bothering Alice with her basketball, she took herself off to bed and Alice took herself off to find Jen. Rio wondered as she curled beneath the blankets whether she’d always feel this way.</p><p>She had enough friends to have experienced the loss of a parent through other people. Hell, Alice had lost her mom when she was young so she knew what grief looked like.</p><p>But grief cannot be understood through a looking glass. Grief can only be understood when it burrowed its way into your life. When Death came knocking and the person you loved answered.</p><p>Rio had been half asleep when she’d heard the soft knock on her bedroom door. She’d assumed Alice, but when she’d grunted her permission to enter it was Agatha who’d stepped quietly into the room.</p><p>Rio sat, mortified, blinking hurriedly to chase waking.</p><p>“Sorry, no one answered the door but I thought… well I thought you’d be in here.”</p><p>Rio nodded and ran a hand through her hair, only managing to make it messier than it already was. “I’m not needed for a couple hours so I just-…”</p><p>Agatha had stepped closer, had closed the door behind her, Rio gulped. “Can I stay with you? Just for a bit? I have about thirty minutes before they need me again.”</p><p>Rio shuffled a little and Agatha took another step closer, her fingers twitching a little at her sides. “Can I…?”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, watching Agatha with cautious eyes as she perched on the edge of her bed by her hip. Her back was stiff, her jaw tight, and Rio could feel the nerves radiating off of her even before she reached to take her hand and found her fingers cold from the spring air.</p><p>“I’ve had a word with wardrobe and…” Agatha turned their hands over, “if it’s okay with you I’m going to wear your shirt in some scenes.”</p><p>Rio frowned, half focused on the fingers now caressing her palm, half on the way Agatha’s eyes remained soft even as her body sat rigid on the edge of the bed, “My shirt?”</p><p>“The cowboy one.”</p><p>Rio’s heart leapt in her chest and she stared up at Agatha who’d now dropped her gaze and was focusing on the soft movements of her own fingers against Rio’s palm. “I-… why?”</p><p>“It’s just in the scenes where we’re being… just lounging around or-…”</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha looked up slowly and Rio bit her lip, “I gave it to you. It’s yours. You don’t need my permission.”</p><p>“I want it.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “You have it.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze again and Rio watched as her brow furrowed a little and the soft touches against her palm became continuous circles drawn in the centre of it. Rio let it happen for a few more seconds, just Agatha’s circling touch and the silence around them before she asked: “Will you lie with me? I’m so tired and I can’t shake this headache.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even acknowledge the question. She just began to move and like two magnets with opposite poles they moved together until their poles aligned again and Agatha was in the bed behind Rio.</p><p>Brown eyes closed as Agatha wrapped herself around her. She felt the chill of her forearm as it rested over her own and wrapped around her middle. She felt the way Agatha’s other arm snuck below her pillow to gain more access. She felt the soft brush of her lips as whispered: “I’ll stay until I have to leave.”</p><p>Rio’s little trailer was cold and so even the throw Alice had provided over the bedsheets hadn’t really helped to keep Rio cosy. But Agatha did. Agatha curled around her, pressed close and tight to her body, brought more warmth than made sense given how cold her paler body actually felt.</p><p>Agatha’s arms were cool, her nose was cooler still, pressed against the back of her neck. But Rio shivered, not because of the chill, but because Agatha had raised her head slightly and the tip of her nose drew a line across her skin. It was like a provocation to feel, to be back in her body when for days now she’d been so in her head where everything hurt and nothing made sense.</p><p>She turned around and into Agatha, and raised her hand to brush back a strand of brown hair from Agatha’s cheek. Agatha looked flushed, and her cheeks felt warm now to the touch.</p><p>“Are you comfortable?”</p><p>“You know I am.”</p><p>“You feel warm.”</p><p>“I’m perfect.”</p><p>Rio shifted a little and moved her fingers down Agatha’s cheek until she tapped the tip of her nose just once. “Too warm?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I’m fine. You feel cold.”</p><p>“I’m fine. Just tired. I have a headache.” Rio felt her lips twitch in her attempt to smile and watched as Agatha just frowned across at her. She moved her hand away from her face and instead reached behind her to wrap her hair around her fingers and in that way toy with it, tying Agatha to her. Tethering.</p><p>“You’ve been eating?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“It’s just a question.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and watched as Agatha’s lashes fluttered when she exhaled slowly. “I had pollo guisado yesterday. This morning I had one waffle and-…”</p><p>“You don’t need to tell me everything.”</p><p>Rio actually smiled this time and Agatha smiled too, which drew Rio’s attention to her lips. She shivered again. Agatha tightened her hold on her.</p><p>“I’m eating,” Rio sighed out, closing her eyes to reject the temptation. “I promise. I’m just tired.”</p><p>“And warm,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio opened her eyes again.</p><p>“I knew you were too hot.”</p><p>Rio untangled her fingers from Agatha’s hair and was in the process of pulling away and throwing the blankets from them when Agatha made a noise of protest and suddenly they weren’t lying together anymore so much as wrestling in the bed.</p><p>It started innocently enough. Agatha simply tugged Rio back and Rio denied her. Then Agatha’s fingers sought the sensitive parts of Rio’s sides that made her squeal. Rio’s body was soon near-convulsing as she writhed around in her attempts to get Agatha away from her.</p><p>Laughter filled the little trailer for the first time in days and only when Rio’s cheeks were a deep red and tears were streaming down her face did Agatha relent.</p><p>“That! W-was! CRUEL!”</p><p>Rio’s arms were crossed over her body, protecting herself from any more vicious attacks. But Agatha looked satiated now. She looked smug and happy and Rio only laughed out a groan as she rolled away from her, only to be chased again but this time with hungry arms instead of prodding fingers.</p><p>“Noooooo! Come back!”</p><p>Another burst of laughter from Rio and then she gasped.</p><p>She was on her back now, panting to the sky. Agatha was over her, her palms down either side of her head and her knees either side of her hips. Agatha looked dazed, hypnotised.</p><p>They both stared at each other. Rio feeling warmer than before. The good kind of warm. The right kind. Her head didn’t hurt anymore.</p><p>Rio was the first to move, because she couldn’t help herself and Agatha seemed frozen in place. She put her hands on Agatha’s thighs and swallowed thickly as she continued to stare up at her. But Agatha’s eyes had closed, as if Rio’s touch were a trigger. She was breathing out slowly through her mouth, visibly trying to calm herself down.</p><p>Before Rio could register anything else, Agatha had moved from above her and was instead moving back to her side, her arm now loosely thrown across her stomach to maintain her hold, but barely.</p><p>She’d snuck down to kiss her shoulder and Rio knew it was a denial, but a gentle one.</p><p>Grief was undignified so without a hint of shame because she had none left, Rio questioned, “If I asked again, would you kiss me?”</p><p>The words hung like a guillotine in the air until Agatha released the tied rope and said: “No.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and placed her hand on Agatha’s arm, “Is there going to be a time limit to this… this decision?”</p><p>“I want to make sure that-…”</p><p>“I’ll never be over my dad dying, Agatha.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I’ll never be over you.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her shoulder again and soon said, “If… if Miguel were still here… would you want to kiss me?”</p><p>The answer was yes. It was always yes. Even when she’d been broken and battered by what Agatha had done it had been yes. When she’d taken the time to try to heal before speaking to Agatha it was yes. When she’d been at her worst, at her smallest, at her weakest, yes. Built back up, healed by time and Agatha’s steadiness, yes.</p><p>Agatha was inevitable. Wanting her was forever.</p><p>But a life where Miguel was alive was one she couldn’t bring herself to speak on. So she said nothing and Agatha only held her a little tighter.</p><p>Rio didn’t know how to function anymore. Everything tumbled around in her mind until the ache was back and even the arms around her couldn’t keep it at bay.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it? About your dad?”</p><p>Rio shuddered out a breath and Agatha tightened her hold.</p><p>“I got too lucky. We were too lucky. Too happy.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“I loved him so much and now I… I don’t know where to put it all.”</p><p>She turned onto her side sniffing and wiped at her eyes with the side of her fist, feeling Agatha’s hold tighten again, until their bodies were completely flush, until her own breathing felt like Agatha’s.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to go anywhere. It hurts so badly because you loved him so well. And he loved you the same.”</p><p>Rio sniffed, a big snotty, disgusting noise. Agatha just clung to her like ivy to stone, patient and immovable.</p><p>“It was me,” Agatha said after a while, when the only thing that had been breaking the silence were Rio’s sniffles and the sounds of her as she moved against the blankets to wipe at her eyes. “I lied at breakfast the other day. Alice didn’t know. I got Maria to change the schedule. I’ve moved my scenes up so you can do less for as long as possible.”</p><p>Rio sniffed, swallowed, made a high-pitched noise with the contraction of her throat.</p><p>“You’d didn’t need to do that.”</p><p>A warm breath was exhaled across the back of her neck and Rio shivered for it, moving her damp hand down to clutch at Agatha’s where it held her shoulder, below her jaw.</p><p>“If it means you get some rest, some time to breathe, then I’m happy to do it.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, closing her eyes as the battery of her brain began to slow to a steady rhythm again. “That’s better than a car, I suppose.”</p><p>She couldn’t see it but she could tell Agatha was smiling when she said: “You still need a new car.”</p><p>“I love my car.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed a laugh and Rio cracked a smile as she ducked her head to place a wet kiss to Agatha’s hand. “Thank you.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“Moving the schedule, caring if I have a crappy car.”</p><p>“Crappy now, is it?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s smile this time. She’s pressed her face into her neck and Rio’s heart thrummed so loudly in her chest it drowned out the dull ache of her head.</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes closed and focused on the feel of Agatha, on the warmth of her face, the tight hold of her hand, the curve of her body around her. It was a tether to the person she used to be. The people <em>they</em> used to be.</p><p>The couple she hoped they could still be.</p><p>Agatha’s time with her was soon up and neither said anything as Agatha moved to turn Rio onto her back, to look down at her with those ocean eyes. The thumping in her head seemed to echo the words “stay, stay, stay”, but her lips couldn’t form them.</p><p>So Agatha kissed her cheek, tasting the salty sorrow painted there, and she left without another word.</p><p>Rio curled in on herself after that, her headache preventing her from sleeping again.</p><p>That afternoon Rio was needed for background. Which meant she was mostly in her pyjamas chosen for her by the costume department. She traipsed about from mark to mark, only really vaguely aware of the action going on around her.</p><p>It didn’t matter anyway. She was set dressing more than anything else today. Agatha had apparently made sure of that. Billy was the main focus, had the most lines, was doing the most for the camera. Quill was there too and had attempted to give Rio an awkward hug when she’d first arrived. She’d accepted it only because she was still grateful he hadn’t made a stink about the punch.</p><p>Billy kept close to her between setups and seemed to understand that she didn’t really want to chat. Or else, he just really loved to talk. He spoke of a million things and nothing all at once. The noise of it almost drowned out the grief but didn’t help with the constant, dull headache Rio had been suffering from all day.</p><p>She called her mom when she got home, after saying goodbye to a reluctant-to-leave Alice. Speaking with Anna helped. Her mom told her of all the casseroles she’d been receiving from neighbours, she asked about filming, whether Rio was eating.</p><p>She asked about Agatha.</p><p>Even as she lay her head down on her pillow that night and inhaled the persisting scent of Agatha against the pillow her head continued to throb.</p><p> </p><p><strong>TUESDAY</strong></p><p>Rio didn’t see Agatha all day.</p><p>She wasn’t there in the morning and she wasn’t there in the afternoon. It turned out that Agatha had to be on location for some shots and Rio didn’t need to be there. Which meant she spent the day hanging around her trailer in abject misery.</p><p>Alice almost punctured the mini basketballs to stop Rio from maniacally tossing them up in the air just for something to do.</p><p>Agatha did call though, five times.</p><p>Alice spoke to her each time and only on the final call before Rio was released for the day after doing nothing more than waiting around and smiling into the camera for one shot, did she answer.</p><p>“Alice can you-…”</p><p>“It’s me.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha uttered quietly, “Rio. How are you?”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“How’s the head?”</p><p>“Never had any complaints.”</p><p>“That isn’t funny.”</p><p>Rio smiled down at her knees but she knew it wasn’t. “It’s fine, just a little sore.”</p><p>“Have you been drinking enough?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes at this, her smile fading pretty quickly. “Yes, Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>“It’s just that Alice told me-…”</p><p>Rio threw her basketball at Alice’s head. It hit her with a surprising slap for such a small plastic ball.</p><p>Alice glowered at her as she interrupted Agatha, “I promise I’m drinking enough water and eating enough food. I’m just tired. I feel like I need a banana bag or something.”</p><p>Agatha was silent for a while before she said: “Can I come over tonight? Either just me or with Nicky? I’ll make you whatever you want.”</p><p>It was tempting, <em>beyond</em> tempting, but energy was hard to come by these days and all Rio had been thinking about - other than Agatha - was crawling into bed the moment she got home.</p><p>“No, I… another time, maybe.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio could hear the disappointment in Agatha’s voice but before she could say anything else Agatha was speaking again. “I’ve been meaning to ask you. I know it’s a lot and I know it might not sound like-…”</p><p>A noise on the other end of the line let her know that Agatha had been distracted, that her attention was now floating away from Rio and the mystery “a lot” question. Rio waited impatiently for her to return and ask it but all she got was: “Rio, I have to go. I’ll see you tomorrow? Will you call if-…?”</p><p>“I need anything,” Rio finished for her, twirling her hair around her finger, “Yes. Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>A noise. A crinkle of static on the line. “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha was gone.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p><p>One of the more unusual things about growing up Catholic was that it brought with it a certain penchant for the superstitious. In essence, superstitions are inherently <em>un</em>Catholic but then Rio was never very pious anyway.</p><p>She had an aversion to walking under ladders, she avoided stepping on cracks where possible, and she believed that magpies should be respected. Vocally, if at all possible.</p><p>On this particular Wednesday, even after speaking to her mom for almost an hour that morning, she felt worse than she had all week. Alice told her it was because she’d gone to bed hungry again but Rio felt it could only be because Agatha’s lingering scent on the pillow had lingered its last and disappeared entirely.</p><p>And of course, another reason was that Wednesday’s child was simply full of woe. Rio had been born on a Friday, born to be loving and giving. And so she’d never paid much mind to Wednesday’s curse. But she gave it attention now, and felt its curse with every step she took towards her trailer-shaped prison cell.</p><p>For some unknown reason, she’d woken up with the words repeating over and over in her head until they became an ear worm that buried deeper and deeper the longer the day went on.</p><p><em>Wednesday’s child is full of woe.</em></p><p>Perhaps it was her brain’s way of distracting her from the constant thoughts of her dad. Perhaps it was her brain’s way of having a little joke, of telling her today would be a bad day - not unlike any of the other days she’d been having recently.</p><p>A poem she’d heard as a child, come back to haunt her as an adult. No amount of Hail Mary’s would absolve her of this burden.</p><p>So Rio spent the morning with her one line of poetry, her little basketballs, and her little Alice.</p><p>Jen had stopped by around ten to announce that Agatha was tied up shooting but that she would come over at lunchtime. She looked like she was delivering the news under duress but managed to smile at Rio anyway.</p><p>By the time Rio had run out of energy for the day and her ear worm remained happily swimming around like the harbinger of doom it was, she was more than ready to be left alone to sleep.</p><p>The usual happened. Alice left her to find Jen and Rio tucked herself in in the hopes that Agatha would soon arrive and soon wrap her cold arms around her and silence her new, repetitive friend.</p><p>Only when Rio was eventually woken it was by a hand that felt different to Agatha’s, though no less cold.</p><p>“Dear, don’t you think it’s time you joined your friends?”</p><p>Rio blinked heavily, rubbing quickly at her eyes as if to hurry her waking as she sat with some difficulty amongst the pile of blankets on the bed.</p><p>“Lilia.”</p><p>“We’ve missed you, you know. You’ve made quite the impact across the hearts and minds of our little group.”</p><p>Rio frowned and ran a hand through her hair, once again making it messier than it had been before. “What do you-…?”</p><p>“Come! Have lunch with us. I know it’s hard but it’ll help, I promise.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and if it had been Billy or anyone else she’d have refused but Lilia had a way about her. A stern but fair matriarch who wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer - especially when she thought ‘no’ was the <em>wrong</em> answer.</p><p>So Rio extracted herself from the bed and after briefly checking herself over in the mirror she grabbed a light sweater and followed Lilia over to craft services where she found what looked like the whole production taking their lunch.</p><p>Since the funeral it was more people than Rio had seen in one space. She felt shy suddenly and shrunk in on herself as people greeted her, some with genuinely happy faces and some with that awful pitying look she’d never get used to.</p><p><em>Full of woe. Full of woe.</em></p><p>Rio went up to get a plate of food, not paying much attention to what she was ordering but just knowing she should eat <em>something</em> so she grabbed a bag of Oreos for good measure and went to take her place beside Billy.</p><p>It felt awkward. Incredibly so. But Billy was on a roll about a date he’d been on the previous night and Lilia kept throwing comments her way to encourage her to join in and so soon it all felt… normal.</p><p>Her ear worm went silent.</p><p>She was halfway through her food when she caught sight of the one person missing from this gathering. Agatha had hurried into view, looking, as far as Rio could tell, panicked.</p><p>She straightened slightly as if the extra inch or two would help Agatha to spot her. Inevitably, it did.</p><p>Agatha strode over, almost knocking one of the background artist’s trays out of their hands. The actor looked mortified to have been in Agatha’s way but Agatha barely batted an eyelash as she made a beeline for Rio.</p><p>“I-… was looking for you.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, staring up into wide eyes even as Lilia stood and held her hand out to Agatha.</p><p>“Sit, sit. I stole Rio away to get her out of her little nest.”</p><p>Rio smiled meekly up at Agatha as she moved over to sit down diagonally opposite her. It felt strange now to have her so close but not be in touching distance. And seeing her around other people, sitting at craft services when Rio was pretty sure Agatha would rather be caught dead than here under any other circumstances… it felt surreal.</p><p>Rio picked up an Oreo from her plate and handed it across to her. It was a peace offering. A, “sorry I wasn’t where you expected me to be and you panicked”, offering. Agatha eyed it for a second and then took it. As she bit into it Lilia said: “Lovely! We’re all together. Isn’t this wonderful?”</p><p>Rio had been too busy watching Agatha nibble at the cookie to notice that Lilia was expecting a response.</p><p>“Oreos are delicious,” Rio said with a smile, watching as Agatha took an age to chew her first mouthful.</p><p>“They’re disgusting and full of crap,” Agatha retorted only a second before she took her next bite.</p><p>“Then <em>why</em> are you eating it?”</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia said with a grin, “I think we all know the answer to that, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to Lilia and out of the corner of her eye she could see Agatha, blushing through her frown as she made the Oreo finally disappear.</p><p>Rio flailed for words until Billy put her out of her misery and said: “Do you usually eat in your trailer, Agatha? I haven’t seen you here before. Maybe, maybe we could do alternate trailer lunches or something!”</p><p>Rio had to fight her smile as she saw Agatha’s eyes swivel to Billy and look across at him like he had suggested they have a giant orgy or something. To save her answering Rio handed her another cookie.</p><p>“Anyway,” Lilia interrupted gallantly, “isn’t it dear little Nicky’s birthday soon?”</p><p>Agatha was watching Rio as she bit the Oreo in half and it was when they locked eyes again that Rio suddenly had a thought. A curious one born of that strange pull towards the superstitious.</p><p>“What day were you born?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows, “April twenty first.”</p><p>“Taurus,” Lilia said perceptively, “Stubborn, loyal, steadfast, attuned to the physical.”</p><p>Agatha shot Lilia a glare but Rio just ignored her.</p><p>“No, I mean, I know that.” Rio cleared her throat, she’d known Agatha’s birthday years before she’d even met her. “What <em>day</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s face relaxed again as she turned back to Rio and she watched her in thought for a second before she said: “A Wednesday. Why?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help the gasp that escaped her lips and for a second she malfunctioned, her brain sputtered to a halt and then became a kamikaze.</p><p><em>Full of woe. Full of woe.</em></p><p>“Rio?” Agatha was moving now, coming round the other side of the table to crouch down by Rio’s side. Agatha’s hand rested on the table to support herself and her other sat on the small of Rio’s back.</p><p>“It’s nothing. Sorry, just this-… nothing.”</p><p><em>Full of woe. Full of woe.</em></p><p>She turned and forced a smile at Agatha, seeing the concern swimming in blue-green irises, and Lilia spoke up again: “Children born on Wednesday are typically intelligent, good and quick learners, gifted in the art of persuasion, again, loyal-…”</p><p>Had she known this already? Had she somehow deduced the day of Agatha’s birth? Had her broken, wretched brain been repeating ‘Agatha, Agatha, Agatha’ to her all day and she’d not even been aware?</p><p>She swallowed, turning her head from Agatha beside her but placed her shaking hand over hers on the table.</p><p>“Thank you, Lilia. I… was just curious, that’s all.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched below her own but she knew she wasn’t about to pull away. She took a breath as Lilia watched her curiously and the hand on her back began to draw soft circles there.</p><p>“Do you want my seat, Agatha?”</p><p>Rio kept her gaze on Lilia who seemed to be thinking quite hard about something as she felt Agatha and Billy swap places and suddenly the hand that had been on her back was now on her thigh instead.</p><p>“The old nursery rhyme?”</p><p>Rio blushed a little and nodded at the old woman. “Just… had it in my head all day. I’m not sure why.”</p><p><em>Agatha, Agatha, Agatha.</em></p><p>Lilia hummed as Rio reached below the table to take Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Nursery rhymes, small poems, songs, ditties, are passed down usually from mothers to children. They’re short and repetitive, they rhyme, all so they can be remembered and given to the next generation. We get comfort from them because they remind us of our mothers, of our childhood.”</p><p>“Um,” Agatha said suddenly, “What nursery rhyme?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and squeezed Agatha’s hand, “Monday’s Child.”</p><p>“I don’t know it.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and turned in her seat to look at Agatha. It felt ridiculous that this was happening, that she’d made a big deal out of an errant line from a random poem that every child in America had inadvertently memorised without even meaning to.</p><p>Every child except one.</p><p>“It goes through the days and each day… each day is a different thing.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow and Rio knew it was an encouragement to finish her thought.</p><p>“Wednesday’s child,” she said in a softer tone than before, “is full of woe.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, because it was what you did when people told you a fact, even if you didn’t believe it. A flicker of surprise had sparked in blue eyes and then died just as quickly as it was born. Clearly she didn’t put any power behind children’s poems, clearly her miserable, Presbyterian upbringing held no space for silly things such as superstition or poetry.</p><p>Her mother had no love in her heart and no desire to pass down joy, love, poetry of any kind to her child.</p><p><em>Full of woe. Full of woe. Agatha. Agatha.</em></p><p>Rio was choking on the line now, feeling it cut off the oxygen needed to feed the worm in her brain. But Agatha was looking at her steadily, ignorant of the reason for Rio’s reaction and therefore calming it.</p><p>“Okay,” she said in a tone just as soft as Rio’s. “And what day were you born?”</p><p>Agatha was placating her, she knew it when she heard it. She knew it by the soft upturn of her soft lips, of the way she squeezed her hand in secret. But it helped, it made it seem not embarrassingly silly but just… silly silly.</p><p>“Friday.”</p><p>“And that is?”</p><p>“Loving and giving.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and reached to steal another Oreo as if to play it off. “That right?”</p><p>Rio laughed, and in doing so freed her throat, and swallowed down the air she needed to think straight. Agatha had breathed sense and life into her. She moved their joined hands into Agatha’s lap so she could release her hand and wrap her fingers around her thigh instead. Agatha pushed her hand a little further up and shot her a look as her lips closed around the Oreo.</p><p>“Feeling better?”</p><p>Rio hadn’t held Agatha like this in so long. She hadn’t felt the thrill that came from being allowed to, from allowing <em>herself</em> to. The dull ache in her head seemed to vanish as she smiled at Agatha and Wednesday’s child began to <em>glow</em>.</p><p>“Oh I think she is,” Lilia answered for her and Rio huffed in response and stole the other half of Agatha’s Oreo.</p><p>Where belief and faith merged in Rio’s mind, everything came down to the turn of Agatha’s lips as she watched her, the feel of the fingers now tracing along the back of her hand, the warmth of her thigh.</p><p>The tether tugged. The tether transformed. A road now. A road to Damascus.</p><p>“So lunch,” Billy conjectured, feeling left out of the conversation and trying to turn it back to the most important issue here: could he get an invite to Agatha’s trailer. “We’ll swap lunchtimes in everyone’s trailers?”</p><p>Rio smiled a little as Lilia picked up the loose threads of conversation and went back to picking at her food, aware only of the absent ear worm and the warmth of her fingers curled around Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Her headache had dissolved; whether from eating a full meal or having Agatha so close she couldn’t be sure. But it was gone and Rio felt far from the woe she’d been focused on all day.</p><p>Time with Agatha could only last so long and soon she had to leave to go back to hair and makeup ahead of filming. With a quick kiss to the cheek and a soft squeeze of her shoulder she disappeared from them and Rio watched her go, feeling Lilia’s gaze on her the whole time.</p><p>Eventually Alice found her and told her they were free to go home early so Rio gathered her things from her trailer and followed Alice out to her car.</p><p>She dropped her off and Rio lounged around the rest of the afternoon, called her mom, made herself a small dinner, developed another headache, and went to bed at nine, all poetry and rhymes gone from her brain.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p><p>Rio’s headache was still present by the time she woke and it took a long while for her to force herself from her bed and into the shower. The only saving grace was that the poem that had haunted her steps yesterday was a distant memory now, shrouded by grief again.</p><p>She knew Alice would already be downstairs so she tried to rush herself. She tried to go faster, to make her body move. But the weakness was back despite everything she’d done to try to prevent it.</p><p>She’d been right about Alice. Her coffee was poured and Alice had a smile on her face, but still, that enduring pain.</p><p>The journey to set was quiet again. Only when they were in the trailer and Rio was checking her sides for the day - a small number, she saw she’d be in a scene with Agatha - did Alice begin to talk.</p><p>“So,” she said and Rio could her the nerves in her voice even as she placed her sides down and began to peel away the foil of the bagel left for her on the side. “Jen and I were wondering,” she cleared her throat as Rio took a bite, “if you’d want to come over for dinner soon?”</p><p>Rio was glad she’d taken a mouthful of food because it gave her time to process rather than just giving a flat ‘no’. She swallowed heavily and cleared her throat, “Oh?”</p><p>“We think it’d be good if-…”</p><p>“Would Agatha be there?”</p><p>“No,” Alice uttered cautiously, “We’d do it separately. You, and then Agatha and Nicky another night.”</p><p>Rio nodded and picked a bit of bacon from her bagel. “Okay. Sure.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded again, picking now at the bread, “Yes. Nice. Normal. Things going back to normal. All good.”</p><p>Was the bacon she’d just swallowed lodged in her throat? It felt like it was. She cleared her throat twice but found it wasn’t moving. Something was stuck there, hard and insistent. Her eyes began to water for the feel of it, for the feeling of being choked.</p><p>“You okay there, babe?”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio husked out, slapping her chest and coughing. “Just… something stuck.”</p><p>Alice moved over and instead of providing the Heimlich like Rio thought she should she instead sat down beside her and rubbed Rio’s back. “Things going back to normal don’t mean… don’t mean that we’ll forget Miguel, Rio. Or you. We won’t forget you either, okay?”</p><p>Rio gasped as though she’d been actually unable to breathe and Alice threw her arms around her as she began to cry. It was the first time in three days now. The tears fell as if they’d been waiting for the dam to burst: thick and numerous.</p><p>Alice held her through it until Rio’s headache was so bad she had to crawl into bed and her bagel sat forgotten and cold on the side. The only thing Alice could do was to leave pain relief and water on the side and go to find the First AD to ensure they had enough time for Rio to sleep off some of her misery before she had to show up and do her job.</p><p>Rio could afford an hour to sleep. After that, she was up again, and Alice was ushering her to hair and makeup. Her reception was as cheery as usual and Rio fumbled her way through the small talk whilst clutching her water bottle as if hydration were her big issue.</p><p>Costume was much the same. Stevie was waiting for her with her costume in her trailer and she made the same small talk with her as handed her her reindeer sweater and sweatpants to change into. She helped, too, with her jewellery. The final piece of it being the ring Agatha had picked for her.</p><p>The hold of it around her finger was, this time, somewhat of a comfort.</p><p>Her task today was to sit on the couch reading until Agatha arrived and took precedence over her book. It was easy. She had no lines. She just had to sit, pretend to read, wait for Agatha to come, and hold her close when she did.</p><p>It was a travesty she had to even be on set. But Agatha would be there and in between set ups she might even be able to hold her a little longer.</p><p>Agatha was behind the dolly cam talking to Maria when Rio arrived. She was in her own costume: a burgundy plaid shirt and jeans. Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows and her hair was in a messy bun. And Rio realised how much she missed her in the first two seconds of seeing her.</p><p>Her head hurt a little more and she sipped at her water as she was taken over to the couch and situated by the First AD. It didn’t take long for her presence to be noticed by others too and it was Pepper who made it to her before either Agatha or Maria.</p><p>“Rio! How are you? I’m so sorry to hear about your dad.”</p><p>Rio smiled and nodded, taking the book that an assistant was now handing her. “Thanks, Pepper.”</p><p>Unfortunately for her, the kind blonde dropped down to her knees before where she sat on the couch. “If you need to talk, I’m here for you. And if any of the work you’ll be doing now feels-…”</p><p>Rio heard her name suddenly and turned her head to see Agatha marching towards them, looking less than happy that Pepper was there. She looked even less happy that Pepper had her hand on Rio’s knee.</p><p>“I mean it, Rio.” Pepper said with a soft smile as she turned back to her. “Anything you need, okay? I’ll let Agatha take care of you for now.” And to Rio’s surprise just as Agatha arrived Pepper winked and stood to leave.</p><p>“Agatha!” Pepper was beaming and held her arms open but Agatha ignored them and did a perfect pirouette to sit down beside Rio’s thigh on the edge of the couch.</p><p>“Pepper.”</p><p>She found Rio’s hand, turned it over, linked their fingers.</p><p>“Now, I’ll be in video village if anything comes up. But simple scene. Rio, we’ve discussed it already but Agatha-…”</p><p>“Consider the intimacy coordinated,” Agatha replied drolly. Rio squeezed her hand.</p><p>“Right,” Pepper said, clearly still struggling with how to deal with Agatha. “Well, anything you need!”</p><p>Rio smiled as she left and glanced at Agatha’s profile as someone came over to adjust her hair, “You can be nicer to her, you know?”</p><p>“I hate being told how to-…”</p><p>Agatha huffed and didn’t finish her thought because they were surrounded now. Maria had arrived too and was finishing off orders, making sure everyone knew their shots, that Agatha was on her mark, that Rio was draped on the couch just so.</p><p>There was safety in being told what to do. Comfort in it. So Rio allowed herself not to think, to sink into her body as best she could, to let Maria tap each of her limbs into place. Only it didn’t last long. Agatha was back over and instead of tapping she was holding, touching, guiding.</p><p>“Here,” she instructed, moving Rio until she was more satisfied with her position. Maria looked a little put out but given the state of her relationship with Agatha after their lunch date fiasco, she said nothing.</p><p>Rio only kept her gaze on Agatha’s face, pleased the makeup artists had painted her minimally so she could count every freckle on her nose as she finished her adjustments.</p><p>“I can slot in easier this way.”</p><p>Rio only nodded, only met Agatha’s gaze with a semi-smile, and then watched her as she left.</p><p>She raised her book, tried to relax her tired body and waited for ‘action’.</p><p>The scene was so simple. Dani was reading, Kate entered all het up and annoyed. She took a seat against her wife, let her envelope her, let her calm her. Dani simply read around her, held Kate close, soothed her just by being there.</p><p>The parallels weren’t lost on Rio as action was called and she pretended to read. Agatha soon arrived, not quite huffing but certainly in the region of it. She raised her gaze, raised her brows, watched in slight amusement as Agatha made herself at home between her thighs, in her arms.</p><p>She sighed as Agatha turned her head against her jaw, as she positioned herself so she could continue to read.</p><p>“Cut!”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and heard Agatha grumble but not sit up.</p><p>“Back to one!”</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha actually huffed and threw herself off the couch to march back.</p><p>They went again, this time Agatha made a show before she sat down. She looked down at Rio until she looked up and shot her a scowl before she dramatically slumped into her and this time grabbed her hand and held it against her stomach.</p><p>It was a better take, a more character-driven take.</p><p>Rio placed a kiss to her temple, squeezed her hand, and breathed out heavily, making a show of being calm even around her grumpy wife.</p><p>They did this several more times. Each time Agatha changed it up. Each time Agatha brought something new to the dynamic. She kissed Rio’s jaw, she pressed into her neck, she placed her hand under her sweater.</p><p>Each time Rio just had to react, just had to follow Agatha. Each time she felt better and better about what she was doing. She wasn’t just acting with Agatha anymore. She was acting with one of the greats, with one of the <em>best</em>.</p><p>Every single take was new. Rio didn’t know what Agatha was going to do. Maria tried for direction but Agatha never took it. She adjusted it, even if she did. She made it her own.</p><p>She raised a hand to Rio’s cheek when Maria had called for less touching. She sighed heavily when Maria had called for a smile. She curled her legs up when Maria wanted them lying down.</p><p>But every time it worked. All the takes were useable because Agatha knew what she was doing and Rio knew how to react to her.</p><p>Eventually, they were done. Rio was dismissed for the day and Agatha was kept back for more shots. They parted with a quick but close hug and as Rio stepped off the set she felt the return of her pain.</p><p>It was when she arrived home that night that her evening routine of Anna, food, bed, was interrupted. She’d been about to turn off the lights, about to try and sleep, when her phone had lit up.</p><p>Usually she’d ignore it. She’d barely been on it for days now. But Wanda’s name shone bright up at her and for some unknown reason she answered.</p><p>“Wanda. Hey.</p><p>“Hey, you. Is there a reason you’ve been avoiding me?”</p><p>“Wands, I really haven’t-…”</p><p>“I know, sweetheart. Look, I’m so sorry about your dad. I really am. I can’t even imagine-…” she sighed and Rio rubbed at her temple, “Look. Alice said you don’t really want to talk but I have to do press in New York next week so I’ll be in Boston at the weekend and well, I’ve colluded with Alice to get us tickets to the Celtics game.”</p><p>Rio laughed a little and stretched her neck back. It was good to talk to someone separate from the misery, someone who was happy to speak to her regardless. “And why would you do that?”</p><p>“Selfishly? Because I want to see you. Unselfishly? Because you need a friend.”</p><p>Rio hummed, “I’m not sure I’m in the mood to be-…”</p><p>“Look, your usual seat. As much alcohol as I can get into you. And afterwards I’ve dinner booked for us and Jessica, she wants to see you too. It’ll be nice, quiet, fun. It’ll take your mind off of things. Say you’ll come.”</p><p>Rio groaned this time but nodded and only realised she hadn’t said anything when Wanda asked: “Babe? You there? You gonna come? Support your team and make your friend happy?”</p><p>Rio laughed, “Yes. Yes to both. I’ll come.”</p><p>“Good because I’ve already paid for your flight out on Saturday morning. Alice got your hotel, so you owe me one drink and Alice maybe two.”</p><p>Rio scoffed but somewhere in her chest she felt a slither of light seeping through the darkness. “You’re forcing me to Boston?”</p><p>“Well, asking, technically… but! I’d really like you to come. We don’t have to go to the game if you’re not up to it. Come see me, come see Jessica. We can have a few drinks, you can cry and I can be the shoulder you cry on. Say yes.”</p><p>Rio groaned again as she stared up at the dark ceiling above her. “Yes, okay. I promise I’ll come.”</p><p>“Good. I’ve emailed across your flights so just show up at the right time and I’ll see you at the hotel.”</p><p>Rio sighed as she rubbed her face, “I’m really not-…”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to be your usual party animal self. I’m just asking you to show up, okay? We can take it easy or go as hard as you want. Whatever you feel like.”</p><p>The idea of escaping for a day or two was appealing. She couldn’t outrun herself but perhaps she could outdrink herself. Maybe even shout so loud at the game she lost her voice and would no longer have to make small talk with people offering their condolences.</p><p>“Okay, Wanda. I’ll be there.”</p><p>“Good. Sleep tight. I’ll see you in a couple days.”</p><p>Rio hung up. Sleep didn’t come for her that night. Something else did. Something that felt different to her usual misery. Something that settled in the pit of her stomach and crept all the way to the base of her throat.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><p>“Up!”</p><p>Rio groaned and rolled over in the bed, trying to escape Alice’s grabbing hands.</p><p>“Last day then your trip. Come on. You sleep at work anyway.”</p><p>“Kept <em>that</em> quiet,” Rio accused groggily.</p><p>“It’s a good surprise! A <em>nice</em> one.”</p><p>Rio huffed and the morning didn’t go much better from then on. Rio’s headache was worse than ever and she couldn’t figure out why. She’d been drinking plenty of water, she’d eaten a normal amount the day before, she’d not even had any alcohol.</p><p>And still she suffered. She wondered if it were her grief, making the journey from her heart to her head to spread the pain so she could withstand it. But she’d long since decided that her body couldn’t control itself at the moment. Her brain and her heart just did what they wanted.</p><p>The trip to work, as usual, was silent, and Rio was more grateful for it today than ever because her head was still sore, still all over the place, still drowning in her grief.</p><p>In the trailer she found her ball and didn’t even bother to check her sides before she went about throwing and catching it, making Alice scowl and her brain quieten.</p><p>After a while Alice prompted her to go to costume, to hair and makeup, and eventually to set. She was to spend the morning taking publicity shots. This usually involved being posed in various embarrassing positions but by some act of grace from God, she was simply sat or stood by a Christmas tree having to look various degrees of melancholic. This, she knew, she could do.</p><p>When she was done and back in her sweats in her trailer she took up her usual position with her little ball again and went about the rest of the morning annoying Alice with it.</p><p>But ten minutes after they’d arrived back there was a soft knock at the door and Alice went to answer it.</p><p>“Hi Alice.”</p><p>Rio froze where she was on the couch and looked up to see Agatha standing about two foot down below Alice.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>Rio sat up straight, actually thinking about her posture for the first time that day - which was saying something because she’d been on camera for four hours that morning.</p><p>Alice made a noncommittal noise and stepped back so Agatha could enter and Rio forgot how to breathe. Agatha looked nervous. No, she looked terrified. Her hands looked tight by her sides and her jaw was working overtime as she stepped into the centre of the room and stopped just before the coffee table.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and cleared her throat. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’ve been meaning to ask you all week but-…” Agatha looked at Alice, “I was worried you’d say no but Nicky really wants you to come and-…”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and the look on her face made Rio’s head sear with a sudden pain unlike any she’d felt all week. But there Agatha was, looking more like she was standing before the gallows than before Rio.</p><p>“I don’t want to pressure you. I don’t want… I… I’m sorry I’ve left it so late. It’s Nicky’s birthday tomorrow and he wants you to come to the Celtics game with us.”</p><p>Rio looked down and wondered if she’d ever felt the hair stand on edge at the back of her neck before. Because she certainly felt it now.</p><p>She reached behind herself to rub at it, to try and calm her racing heart, her rising levels of panic, the thrum, thrum, thrum of her throbbing head.</p><p>“Actually,” she breathed out after a few seconds, “I’m already going.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha raised her brows and looked to Alice before looking back to Rio. “You are?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked for the first time to Alice since Agatha had entered the room. She looked tense, as if ready to spring if Rio gave her the instruction. But far from asking her to attack she instead motioned with her head to the door in a silent plea for Alice to leave them alone. When she did, she did so only after shooting Rio a meaningful ‘I’ll be right outside’ look.</p><p>Rio sighed when the door closed and looked back to Agatha. Quick was best. Quick and easy. Like ripping off a bandaid.</p><p>“Don’t read into it, okay? I-… I’m going with Wanda.”</p><p>Any meteorologist worth their salt could tell you the differences between a regular thunderstorm and a cyclone, of which they are varied and myriad. But one of the main differences is the time it takes for the storms to brew.</p><p>A thunderstorm, for instance, is formed quickly from rapidly rising air and matriculates into a storm within minutes, or hours. A cyclone is different and can be left to steep for weeks before it’s strong enough to explode into the atmosphere and reap destruction in its path.</p><p>Agatha looked a lot like she was the latter as she span on the spot and those pale hands raised to run through hair which suddenly looked wild, suddenly thicker, longer, as if the static radiating from her anger had inspired it.</p><p>Rio knew Agatha had her problems with Wanda, knew she always had, and so this explosion had been building and building and suddenly Rio was in the eye of the storm.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>The woman before her was taking deep breaths, still turned from her, still with those fingers buried deep in the thickets of her wavy hair.</p><p>“Agatha. We’re just friends. I haven’t seen her for a while now and-…”</p><p>“Are you staying over? In Boston? With Wanda?”</p><p>Each preceding question felt harsher than the last. And Rio cleared her throat as she stared at Agatha’s back. Agatha had only be soft with her lately. Only so soft something she felt like she’d melt in Rio’s hold.</p><p>And now she was a raging inferno, now she was hard and angry and Rio had to swallow down her panic at the sight of it.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her hands then, unable to look at Agatha anymore, to cope with her being so angry she was practically incandescent.</p><p>“We’re having dinner with Jessica after the game and-…”</p><p>“Who the fuck is Jessica?!”</p><p>Rio inhaled a sharp breath and looked up to see the storm billowing in bright eyes. “Jessica Dyson. She was nominated with us. She-…”</p><p>Agatha made a noise and threw her hands in the air and just like that she began to pace. Rio squinted at her and tried to focus to avoid the lights beginning to blind her as she felt a piercing pain her in temples.</p><p>“We’re all just friends.”</p><p>Her vision blurred and for a second she couldn’t see anything but a flash of light. The room was silent for a while and Rio brought her head to her hands. Closing her eyes didn’t help.</p><p>“Jen told me what Alice said to you.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“She <em>told</em> me she encouraged you to get <em>under</em> someone. Is that what this is? Wanda? Jessica?” Agatha made a noise that sounded a lot like she was choking. “<em>Both of them</em>?!”</p><p>Everything felt hazy, everything felt too much, too real. It was as if someone had turned the saturation up suddenly.</p><p>Her head was throbbing and even as she tried to look up at Agatha she felt like she couldn’t see her, so bright were the lights in her trailer. “Agatha I don’t… Agatha I don’t feel…” the earth tilted on its axis until hands were on her and a familiar scent filled her lungs.</p><p>“Hey, hey. I’ve got you.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her eyes shut and took several deep breaths until the sharpness dulled a little and she opened her eyes to see the storm in blue eyes was now dissipated. All that was left behind was the destruction to show that it had once been there, had once been great and terrible.</p><p>And now was soft and small.</p><p>“What’s wrong? What happened?”</p><p>“I’m not sleeping with Wanda. I won’t sleep with Wanda. Or Jessica. I-… Agatha there was one kiss, one tiny, inconsequential kiss that happened-…”</p><p>Agatha pulled away and their tether that had just become a lifeline became taught and frayed. But it held on.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>She was pacing now, her shoulders high and her fingers tight. “When?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Tell me <em>when</em>.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and snapped, “Two days after you fucked your husband.” She winced at the strength of her own voice and placed her head in her hands again.</p><p>That made Agatha stop. That made her turn. That made the temperature in the room drop a couple degrees.</p><p>Agatha’s face was, for the first time in a while, unreadable. Juilliard had done a number on her; she was acting her way out of a breakdown.</p><p>Agatha’s irises were storm-born as she stared at Rio but she couldn’t quite make their eyes meet. Agatha wasn’t allowing her to. She just kept staring straight ahead, keeping her gaze on Rio’s right shoulder. The storm and its warning had dissolved again until Agatha asked in a quiet voice: “Punishment?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Rio sat up a little, the warning flash of a migraine threatening her still. But she squinted through it and managed to raise a hand towards Agatha, “Can you come here?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, looked as if she might refuse for a second, and then took strides closer and stopped just before Rio, allowing the tips of Rio’s fingers to only just graze the line of her pants. “It wasn’t punishment. I’d never punish you. She just… wanted to kiss me. So I let her. Just once. It was barely anything and it’ll never happen again.”</p><p>The floating colours began to form behind her eyelids every time she blinked and she knew she didn’t have long.</p><p>“Agatha, please. I-…”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer and Rio could slide her fingers until they curled around her hip. She raised her other hand and found it missed Agatha’s body entirely, her vision now so skewed she had no real depth perception.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, moving closer again so that this time Rio’s hand didn’t miss. She gripped Agatha’s hips and raised her gaze up to look at her but saw only a fuzzy version of the woman.</p><p>“I don’t want anyone else. Haven’t I…? Haven’t I made that clear?”</p><p>Agatha’s hands found her face and Rio closed her eyes, now seeing the flashes behind her eyelids.</p><p>“There’s nothing between you?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, trying to focus on the soft brush of Agatha’s soft thumbs, “No.”</p><p>Silence filled the room for a little while and Rio tightened her told, trying desperately to see through the colours now swirling, now flashing their promise of more pain at her.</p><p>“Are you courtside? I want to be with Nicky on his birthday. I…” she winced and Agatha dropped to her knees.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“A migraine, I think. It’s just stress. Just-…”</p><p>“Come to bed, Rio.” Agatha was whispering now, but Rio couldn’t figure out why. It was just the two of them. Just the them in the small trailer. No one could overhear.</p><p>“You need to be in the dark,” Agatha continued quietly, now tugging at Rio to make her stand. And Rio moved with her, she closed her eyes and trusted Agatha would guide her.</p><p>When the soft feel of the bed behind her knees let her know she was there safely she lay back and felt Agatha remove her shoes and socks. Her lips pressed against the bridge of her foot and then Agatha was moving above her again, helping to tuck her in.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio insisted even as she squeezed her eyes tightly shut and felt the lights ricochet about her skull. “Agatha.”</p><p>Unable to concentrate properly she couldn’t place the noises now happening around her but when she opened her eyes the room had been plunged into blackness. A small dip in the mattress beside her meant that Agatha was close again and she squeezed her eyes shut when she heard her whisper: “I’ll be good tomorrow. I’ll be good.”</p><p>“Mi amor.”</p><p>“Sleep, Rio. I’ll get you some pain relief and-…”</p><p>“Agatha it was barely a kiss.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Focus on sleeping. Nicky will be disappointed if you’re not there. I want you there.”</p><p>Rio nodded blindly and reached out, managing to curl her fingers around Agatha’s shirt. “We’re just friends.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly and then: “And I can be nice to your friend. I promise.”</p><p>Rio nodded and found it hurt to do so. Agatha moved back, she pressed a kiss to where it hurt most on Rio’s temple and then Rio felt the bed shift and she was suddenly alone again.</p><p>Sleep didn’t come easy but it came. Only a gentle hand in her shoulder and a soft voice nearby woke her two hours after she’d fallen.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly, feeling the tension around her brain as she became more aware. The lights were gone; it was dark behind her eyelids.</p><p>“Honey, I’ve got you some drugs. You want to wake up and take them?”</p><p>“Better be the strong stuff.”</p><p>She heard Agatha snort quietly, “As strong as it comes.”</p><p>Rio groaned quietly and rubbed at her eyes.</p><p>“Feeling better?”</p><p>“A little fuzzy but okay.”</p><p>“Take it anyway. It’ll help.”</p><p>Rio huffed as she struggled to sit and held her hand out to receive the small pill Agatha offered. “Thanks.”</p><p>She took the water held out to her too and knocked back the pill with it and grimaced as it slipped down her oesophagus. Agatha was watching her with caution in her eyes and it took her a second to register something else about the woman perched beside her.</p><p>She was wearing her shirt.</p><p>“You’re filming in it today?”</p><p>“Yeah. Laundry scene.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little, reached to touch the collar and remembered the scene from the script. “With James?”</p><p>“Sí.”</p><p>Rio laughed and the grimaced when she found it hurt her to do so. She dropped her hand from Agatha’s shirt. “He as much energy as usual?”</p><p>“I’m working on it.”</p><p>“Magic touch?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>Rio nodded and bit down on the corner of her lip as Agatha met her gaze. They both went to speak at the same time and both smiled shyly at the other as they did.</p><p>“About earlier-…” / “I’ll get him-…”</p><p>“You first,” Rio offered gently, “I was just going to say about Nicky’s gift.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her for a second and the said: “I don’t like her. I don’t trust her. I don’t like her near you and I don’t think…” she sighed heavily as Rio’s brow began to furrow and her hand found its way to Agatha’s collar again. “I don’t think… I just… I don’t <em>want</em>-…”</p><p>“Agatha? We’re just friends. I said yes to Wanda because it’s an escape. It’s a weekend off. A weekend away.” She thumbed the thin fabric of the shirt and looked down at it. Agatha had been styled with a necklace to match, one with a small diamond on it and Rio reached to touch it, “But I’m glad you’ll be there. Unbelievably so.”</p><p>Maybe she was bothering Agatha by toying with her necklace because Agatha reached to take her hand and in doing so stilled her fingers. “It was a push present,” she said quietly, “from Dani to Kate.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and with it her gaze to look up at Agatha, “For having Luca?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio looked back down at the little diamond and for a second her mind went blank before she asked: “Did Ralph get you one?”</p><p>“Three months on my own.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and shifted a little closer. The dull ache in her temple had dissipated now, replaced by the familiar ache in her chest. “Dani’s a good wife.”</p><p>“I think you’d be better.”</p><p>The lifeline became a tightrope then. The way ahead, tethered together or not, was treacherous, but they were all that held the other up.</p><p>A soft gasp escaped Rio’s lips as she looked back at Agatha and saw her eyes swimming with unshed tears. She reached to brush her cheek but Agatha was already pulling away, already standing from the bed and clearing her throat loudly.</p><p>“Alice is just outside I’ll-…”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha was making strides to the door and only stopped when: “Mi vida.”</p><p>Rio crawled out of the covers and knelt at the bottom of the bed, as close to Agatha as she could be without stepping off. “Can I kiss you? Please?”</p><p>Agatha Harkness had her head against the door, her hand curled around the handle, and a tear falling silently down her cheek as Rio waited patiently for her to turn.</p><p>It took a few seconds but Agatha did turn. She turned and moved close so that Rio could lean up and grapple at Agatha’s hips as her face was held and tilted skywards. Agatha looked torn, halfway between agony and hope.</p><p>As Rio’s fingers slipped beneath the shirt that used to belong to her Agatha leant down and pressed a kiss to Rio’s warm cheek. She gasped as she leant into her, breathed out her woe against her, and then left.</p>

<p>The flight out was nightmarish.</p><p>Rio was alone in the airport apart from the photographers who seemed to organically spawn everywhere she turned before she got airside. Even when through security she could feel cameras aimed at her from the unsubtle fans who pointed their phones in her direction.</p><p>She kept her head down, her headphones in, and even the classic disguise of a celebrity trying to be subtle - a cap - on the whole time. Clearly an Oscar now meant she was fair game to anyone she came across.</p><p>She was approached by a handful of people in the queue to board and as quickly and politely as she could she took selfies with them. Only when a woman offered her condolences for her dad did she feel truly uncomfortable about this.</p><p>It was kindly meant, and politely done, but still a stranger speaking her dad’s name to her felt like an intrusion. Smiling, she’d thanked her, posed for the selfie, and returned to having her head down and her music back on.</p><p>After boarding, the first steward to greet her also offered his sympathies and Rio couldn’t help but feel queasy as he reached for her hand and squeezed it. For years now people had known her name, or at least recognised her face and asked, “do I know you from somewhere?”. Occasionally she’d had her arm grabbed or people stand too close for pictures, but people didn’t often take her hand, or reference her parents by name.</p><p>Clearly things were different now. She was public property.</p><p>She thought of Agatha as she buckled herself in and switched her music to something more mind-numbing, all sounds and no words. Agatha Harkness had had her name in lights for at least as long as Rio could remember.</p><p>She’d been seventeen when she’d first been aware of Agatha, and she was creeping ever-closer to thirty three now. Half her life Agatha had been famous. And because of Evanora, Agatha had been a name people knew since her birth.</p><p>In spending time with Agatha and Nicky she’d seen how intense the response to her was. In being on the red carpet with her she’d seen how desperate the press were for her photograph, for her smiles.</p><p>Her idle, music-numbed, mind took her back to the hired hand Agatha had needed just to ensure her and Nicky had safe passage from the car to the stadium and she hoped she’d have one again. Nicky was not only little but he was shy too and Rio, confident and an adult, still struggled with the attentions of crowds. She could only imagine the fear that sensitive Nicky felt when in the midst of the furore around him and his mother.</p><p>Somewhere over Nevada Rio asked for a red wine and settled in for the rest of the flight with her rhythmic music and her hopes for the reunion with her twin and his mom. Wanda being there would be difficult. A disaster waiting to happen, probably.</p><p>But she’d survived the worst thing. She could survive this.</p><p>Her head still hurt, even the red wine couldn’t cure that. But it was a new reality - one where her dad was dead, Agatha wouldn’t kiss her, and her head hurt. She just had to get used to it.</p><p>She was papped again when they landed in Boston. The swarm was larger here and Rio wondered if it was because Agatha had already been through the concourse and they were waiting to see if anyone else would grace their fair city for the game.</p><p>She never used to be bothered here. Boston was always a safe space, a space for Celtics and beer and her dad. A space where people recognised her but bought her drinks rather than shoved their cameras in her face.</p><p>She made it out to the chill early-Spring air and shivered as she waited on a cab to take her to her hotel where she’d drop her bag, call Wanda, and head to the stadium. It didn’t take long for her to arrive and even before she checked in she found Wanda waiting for her in the lobby all smiles and warm hugs.</p><p>“God, I’ve missed you.”</p><p>Rio sighed into the embrace and hugged Wanda as tightly as she hugged her. “You too.”</p><p>As Wanda pulled away Rio couldn’t help but smile back at her, finding the grin sent her way to be infectious, despite the agonies of her mind, body, and soul. “Check in, then we’ll grab a drink and go?”</p><p>“Great,” Rio confirmed, shouldering her trusty duffel before heading up to the desk to check in with Wanda waiting for her in the lobby.</p><p>In her comfortable room she washed her face, applied some more make up and then tied her Celtics scarf securely around her neck. From her duffel she pulled out a smaller crossbody bag containing the gift she’d wrapped for Nicky.</p><p>It had been a last minute call to a store to source but she hoped he’d like it. If he didn’t, well, she’d look like a massive loser but it was a risk she was willing to take.</p><p>When she arrived back in the lobby she found that Wanda was no longer alone. She was standing with two other people; two strangers. One was a tall man with floppy hair and a big grin, the other was a short woman with corkscrew curls and pink cheeks.</p><p>All three of them looked around as Rio got closer.</p><p>“Oh my god! Rio Vidal! I mean! Agh!”</p><p>Rio blinked and looked to Wanda for help as the woman jumped at her and pulled her down into a hug. Wanda gently helped to pry her off as she said, “This is Jerry and Tabitha, Rio. Fans of ours.”</p><p>Rio hummed and nodded a little but said nothing else, and was silent as they took some selfies and eventually, after what felt like far too long, the couple left them alone.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio muttered as Wanda took her arm and steered her in the direction of the outside world.</p><p>“Cornered me before I could escape,” Wanda explained with a sigh. “I saw the pictures of you at the airport in Delaware. They’ve been worse lately?”</p><p>“Unimaginable.”</p><p>Wanda nodded and looked with Rio up and down the street to see if they were about to be descended upon again. Thankfully, they couldn’t see anyone.</p><p>“Come on. Quiet, cosy, dive bar it is. No one will find us.”</p><p>Rio only smiled and they jumped in a cab. Wanda filled the silence and it wasn’t annoying, it wasn’t cloying or maddening that she was doing so. It was done because Rio’s thoughts were too many. Too many to funnel into one, coherent thread of conversation.</p><p>So Wanda picked up the slack. She spoke of filming in the snow in Atlanta. She spoke of the cast and crew and the bar they’d discovered near the Coca Cola Museum. She spoke about things that weren’t death or grief or sleeping with your fuckass husband.</p><p>By the time they made it to the bar and Rio had secured herself a pint of whatever lager was on offer, she felt a little better.</p><p>“Oh shit,” Wanda said suddenly, blinking across at Rio as she removed her jacket in the booth they sat in. “Should I have worn something green?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and looked down at Wanda’s brown sweater, then down at her own green Celtics hooded sweatshirt. She rolled her eyes as she removed her cap and reached to place it on Wanda’s head.</p><p>“There,” she said with a wry smile as she ran her hands through her hair to shake out the telltale signs of cap-wearing. “You’ll fit right in.”</p><p>Wanda just rolled her eyes and adjusted it on her head. She batted her eyelashes over at Rio as Rio took a sip of her pint. “Beautiful?”</p><p>“You know you are.”</p><p>Wanda hummed and her smile faded somewhat as she turned the conversation to the thing Rio had been dreading. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>She looked down at Wanda’s hands curled around her own pint glass, at the silver rings that decorated her fingers, at the deep red polish across her nails. Her throat felt tight.</p><p>“No, not really.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said calmly, watching Rio closely for any take-backs. “Will we talk instead about stealing people’s jobs?”</p><p>Rio’s brown eyes flashed up suddenly and she looked momentarily spooked before she saw that Wanda was smiling again.</p><p>“I’ll get her back, you know.”</p><p>“Has she apologised?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio nodded and took a sip of beer.</p><p>“You know Deadline called me ‘Wendy Maximoff’?” Wanda began rummaging in her back beside her until she had her phone in her hands and was suddenly showing Rio a screenshot. A tweet from Deadline.</p><p><em>Agatha Harkness is replacing Wendy Maximoff in Maria Hill’s seasonal drama ‘Let It Snow’.</em></p><p><em>The film centres on a family as they contend with the matriarch’s terminal illness and intense sibling rivalry during the holiday season.</em></p><p><em>Rio Vidal is also attached.</em></p><p>The pictures chosen for the announcement were in black and white: Wanda and Rio together from a photoshoot a couple years ago and Agatha all alone.</p><p>Rio sighed.</p><p>“I know it’s a good part, Rio, but is there another reason she took it?”</p><p>Rio stared down at the frothy head on her pint and blew gently, watching the bubble part for her. Wanda was silent as she watched and then said: “Is it serious?”</p><p>Rio kept her gaze down, kept her eyes on the bubbles as they filled the hole she’d just gently blown. She could feel Wanda’s gaze on her, her eyes boring into her brain to try and figure out exactly what was going on between her and Agatha.</p><p>But even Rio didn’t know now.</p><p>All she knew was that Agatha was it for her but that they weren’t together. That they might never be together.</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda encouraged with a gentle sigh as she reached for her hand.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” Rio said eventually, glancing at Wanda’s hand. “There’s nothing going on. I’ve told you before. She’s married.”</p><p>Rio pulled her hand away, trying not to be cruel about it, trying only to be able to keep her emotions from getting the better of her. She was soon to see Agatha, soon to see Nicky, she had to keep her head straight.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio sighed and ran her fingers through her hair, looking anywhere now but into green eyes.</p><p>“I’d never judge you, you know.”</p><p>“I-…” Rio huffed and shook her head, crossing her arms defensively over herself as she turned to finally look at Wanda. She trusted her. More than most of her friends. But this wasn’t her secret to give. “I like her. I do. But nothing is going on.”</p><p>Wanda smiled sadly and Rio felt the thrum of her head as she watched her friend pretend to believe her.</p><p>“Okay. Okay. Just seems like when you were absolutely off your face and the only think you could talk about was <em>her</em> I’d think you were-…”</p><p>“Wands.”</p><p>“Look I know back at that luncheon thing you said nothing was happening but-…”</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>“<em>But</em>, her actually taking my part and then-…”</p><p>Rio sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, “Jesus. Look. It’s nothing. Nothing at all. Please can we drop it.”</p><p>Wanda sighed now, “I just think that someone like Agatha Harkness-…”</p><p>“Can you keep your voice down? Holy shit if someone overhears, Wanda.”</p><p>Wanda blinked and looked around at the near-empty bar. Rio rolled her eyes as she turned back to her with a ‘seriously?!’ expression on her face.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio sighed in defeat, “She’s hot. I… she’s hot.”</p><p>“Everyone knows she’s hot, Rio.”</p><p>“I-…” Rio groaned and rubbed her face, instantly regretting it and rummaging in her bag to find her compact. “It doesn’t fucking matter, okay?”</p><p>“She came to your dad’s-…”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about that.”</p><p>“Babe,” Wanda said gently, reaching across for her. “I’m sorry. I just meant that… well, she’s actually a bitch.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up from where they’d been focused in on the table between them, all graffitied and sticky. Someone had written ‘FUCK TERFS’ and she couldn’t help but agree. But then Wanda said <em>that</em>.</p><p>“She’s not a bitch.”</p><p>Maybe she’d said it too harshly because Wanda looked taken aback but managed to school her face as she said: “I like her, okay? But she’s not known for her friendliness and I’m convinced she took my part. Partly because it’s awards fodder and partly because… well, you.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her beer again, forcing herself to relax her posture. Wanda was moving on to different topics now and Rio knew she was doing it for her own benefit as well as Rio’s.</p><p>She didn’t know whether Wanda still had a crush on her. She hoped she didn’t. She <em>assumed</em> she didn’t. Wanda was, not unlike Rio of old, a big flirt. She could have anyone she set her sights on and often did.</p><p>Wanda was just a bit more subtle about it, and less voracious in her appetite.</p><p>Topics pivoted all over the place and Rio began to relax a little. The throbbing of her head died as she got into the swing of chatter again. She was soon able to contribute more than just hums and head nods and even smiled a few times at Wanda’s stories, or added her own commentary to them.</p><p>By the time they’d finished their drinks they had to hurry off to the arena to be there in enough time to get their seats, get more drinks, and be ready for the start of the game. Besides, Rio was anxious to see Nicky, and even more anxious to see Agatha.</p><p>The crowds outside the arena were crazy and Rio and Wanda being amongst them didn’t go unnoticed. Wanda was a little taller but Rio was more determined so she pulled them both through until they could find an attendant to get them to their seats unharmed.</p><p>The way down the steps of the bleachers felt like a mile when she had the two people she most wanted to see waiting at the end for her. She nervously ran her hand through her hair, hoping she didn’t have hat hair when she finally saw Agatha.</p><p>A soft whisper beside her reassured her that she looked great and she turned to smile at Wanda and adjusted her cap for her.</p><p>At the bottom of the steps, now on the court side, she turned and looked up to see the figure of Agatha Harkness and the little legs of her son swinging where his mother was leaning around to talk to him.</p><p>She bit her lip in anticipation of the reaction and only hoped it would be a positive one. From both people involved. As she stepped closer she cleared her throat meaningfully and watched as Nicky leant around Agatha to look up at her and his dark eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio breathed out, and then grunted when a tiny body collided with her own.</p><p>“MELLIZAAAAAA!”</p><p>The birthday boy had thrown himself at her, winded her, and screamed louder than she’d ever heard him scream before. But she laughed as she wrapped her arms around him and just about managed to crouch before him to hug him properly.</p><p>Rio breathed him in, and felt her entire body relax as he clung to her. She felt the pull of home as she held him close, the comfort that family brought.</p><p>“You’re my surprise?!”</p><p>Rio chuckled as Nicky began to jump against her, wriggling enthusiastically as she pulled back to look at him. “Is it a good one?”</p><p>“Only the bestest one!”</p><p>Rio laughed again as Nicky threw himself back at her and she almost lost her balance.</p><p>Above them now Agatha was there, looking amused as she surveyed the reunion. Rio grinned at her and then made a soft noise of surprise of her own as Nicky jumped so violently that she fell back and only just managed to support herself from collapsing entirely.</p><p>“Nicky! Nicky!”</p><p>Nicky was blushing now, whether from the exertion, the excitement, of the fact that everyone was looking at them, Rio didn’t know. He was happy, and that’s all that mattered.</p><p>“Mama said I had one more surprise for my birthday. It’s you! I hoped it would be but when you weren’t here I thought it wasn’t and then!”</p><p>The pain Rio had been in these past two weeks vanished the moment Agatha crouched down beside them and her hand found Nicky’s shoulder and Rio’s knee. “Honey, you gotta let Rio breathe.”</p><p>“He’s okay,” Rio said with a genuine smile as she looked back up to Nicky, a few inches below him where she crouched, holding his sides as he kept his arms around her neck. “I’m excited to see him too.”</p><p>“Oh my god!” Wanda shouted and it made both Rio and Nicky turn to her in surprise. Agatha turned a second later and squeezed her knee in the process. “You look so handsome with your short hair!”</p><p>Nicky shifted on his feet and a slow blush crept across his cheeks as he nodded and said: “Thank you. Just like Rio.”</p><p>Wanda raised her brows at this statement as Rio stood to her full height again and watched as Nicky reached to take her hand and stood a little closer to her. Wanda looked momentarily stuck and then she smiled again, her brows raising hopefully as she crouched down before Nicky and opened her arms out to him.</p><p>Rio knew before Wanda even asked what was about to happen.</p><p>“Could I get a hug from the birthday boy as well?”</p><p>Rio turned her head then and Nicky reached with his other hand to toy with Rio’s fingers. He looked cautious and seemed to be thinking hard about whether or not he wanted to give Wanda a hug as both Rio and Agatha stood framing him like two bodyguards and their charge.</p><p>Nicky didn’t move and Rio was just about to step in when Agatha did instead.</p><p>“Wanda! How rude of me.”</p><p>Rio almost fainted as Agatha moved forwards and pulled Wanda into a rather aggressive hug. Nicky had moved now his mom was no longer beside him and stood before Rio, and Rio naturally held him against her, feeling him toy with her fingers still as he watched his mama hug the red-headed stranger.</p><p>Rio was surprised by her own reaction to seeing Agatha hug Wanda. She felt surprise, sure, but a sense of pride too? Maybe? Something else warm at least.</p><p>“Rio,” Nicky whispered through the noise of the arena, his neck craning back as Agatha was pulling back from Wanda. Rio bent down to let him whisper in her ear, “Why is this lady here?”</p><p>“She’s my friend, mellizo. She’s really nice, I promise. You met her before, remember? In London?”</p><p>“Do I have to hug her?”</p><p>“No, baby. Only hug people you want to hug, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky said with a soft frown as Rio straightened up and kissed the top of his cap. “Mama says that too.”</p><p>Rio smiled and looked up as Agatha was turning back around, looking a little pale but keeping up her smile, and Wanda behind her was beaming a great big, shell-shocked grin. It made Rio laugh, which made Agatha roll her eyes as she swooped in to kiss her cheek.</p><p>They were on show now so she didn’t linger and Rio didn’t turn into her, didn’t seek out her warmth like she usually might. Instead she smiled widely and raised her brows as Nicky wriggled between them, “Feeling friendly today, Agatha?”</p><p>“Trying to,” Agatha offered back with a tight smile and Rio couldn’t help it when she pulled her hand from Nicky’s hold and wrapped her arm around Agatha’s middle to pull her in for a hug. She sighed into it, heard Nicky giggle as he was squashed between them and Agatha wrapped her arms properly around her.</p><p>“People are watching,” Agatha muttered, and Rio sighed again as she pulled back a little, and smiled at Agatha who looked softer again, a pink flush across her cheeks.</p><p>Rio nodded and pulled away properly and found a little tug on her shirt as she did that suggested Agatha hadn’t actually wanted her to pull away. But she was ducking down again, and whispering in Nicky’s ear, “You want a beer, kid?”</p><p>“Noooooo!”</p><p>Rio laughed and shot Agatha a wink as she took Nicky’s hand and pulled him down into the seat beside her usual one and Wanda moved to sit on her other side.</p><p>From then on Nicky began to talk a mile a minute and Rio found that she started to relax for the first time whilst not horizontal with Agatha, hidden away in her trailer. Nicky was bouncing in his seat, his eyes on Rio or the court as he asked questions and probed for details about the game ahead.</p><p>Rio could actually feel her body shrink a couple inches. She’d been so tense and so uptight that she didn’t even know for the past two weeks she’d been physically exhausting herself by constantly tensing her muscles.</p><p>Nicky was so excited and it was infectious, so Rio became excited. And Agatha and Wanda smiled through it, Wanda through being mostly ignored even as she kept trying to engage Nicky in conversation and Agatha through keeping quiet but keeping an eye on her son and Rio.</p><p>“We can,” Rio was saying, “go meet the team, if you want? It’s your birthday, they’d be so happy to see you.”</p><p>Nicky froze and stared up at Rio for a couple seconds before he turned to Agatha with those wide eyes that meant he was nervous but not too afraid to immediately say no. “Can we?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and chewed on her lip. She was just reaching across Nicky to get to Rio when Wanda leant over and spoke suddenly, “If you’d feel more comfortable, sweetie, you can hold my hand the whole time.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darted up to look at steely blue and then down again to watch Nicky as he turned to look around at Wanda. He watched her for a second and then in a small voice said, “No thank you.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and turned to Wanda with raised brows as she whispered, “He’s shy.”</p><p>“No, he just loves you and his mom. And that’s okay.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and squeezed Wanda’s arm before she leant in to whisper to her, “Maybe now’s the time to try again with Agatha?”</p><p>Wanda was the one to roll her eyes now but Rio felt her ear being cupped and Wanda’s warm breath against her as she whispered, “You’re so mommy right now, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened a little and she felt Wanda’s thumb brush her cheek as she pulled away and met smiling green eyes. But it lasted all of two seconds because little arms had suddenly wrapped around her neck and a body collided with her back and she knew Nicky was trying to get her attention.</p><p>But he wasn’t the only one. Agatha was crouching down before her, appearing out of nowhere, and had her hand on Rio’s knee again. Rio’s hands were on Nicky’s arms but her gaze was down on Agatha as Wanda smiled in pleasant surprise and moved back from her.</p><p>“Drinks?” Agatha asked with a tight smile, her grip of Rio’s knee a little harder than it needed to be. “Rio, Nicky, and I can go get them.”</p><p>“Just us,” Nicky whispered close to Rio’s ear and made her smile even as she looked across to see Wanda’s reaction and saw that she was fighting for her life to look as nonplussed as possible.</p><p>She sighed quietly as she turned back to Agatha. “Remember last time? We should send an attendant.”</p><p>Nicky hugged her tighter and Rio raised her brows at Agatha, wondering if she would risk the rush of the crowds just to get away from Wanda for a few minutes.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said after a second of clear indecision written across her face. She was still gripping Rio. Hard. “Maybe an attendant, then.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and moved her hands from Nicky’s tight hold to his legs. “Shitty red wine for everyone? Sorry, Nicky,” she added as she held him more firmly and shuffled in her seat to pull him with her as she stood.</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and her hand had fallen from her knee to now rest around her ankle as Rio stood with her son on her back and jumped a little to hitch him up more comfortably. Nicky giggled against her ear, neither bothered by her cursing or by the fact he’d just been hauled into the air.</p><p>“You’re heavy, mellizo.”</p><p>Rio looked expectantly at Agatha and watched a sly smile grow up her face as she released her hold on Rio and stood. She was directly in front of her now. And close. Deliciously close. She reached up under the pretence of fixing Nicky’s cap. </p><p>“Pretty sure you can lift me,” she muttered as Rio jostled Nicky again.</p><p>“Carry mama too!”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and was turning her head back to side-eye Nicky when Wanda hopped up again to join in the little trio. “She totally could. Carried me in that photoshoot, remember?”</p><p>Rio, right now, would rather not have anyone be reminded of the time she’d done a photoshoot with Wanda for Cosmopolitan. She’d had to carry Wanda on her back in the same way she was currently holding Nicky. Wanda had been heavier than Nicky, obviously, but that wasn’t the problem. The problem was that Wanda had been wearing a mini dress and heels so the thought of Agatha knowing about the shoot, let alone having actually <em>seen</em> it made her blood run suddenly cold.</p><p>“The one with the tiny little dresses and heels?” Agatha asked, her eyes on Rio, checking for a reaction. Or, perhaps, some form of apology.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, Rio thought.</p><p>“Yeah!” Wanda exclaimed with a grin at Agatha’s question, “She held me for like, I don’t know, a long time!” A soft laugh followed her words as Wanda clearly got roped back into thinking Agatha was interested in anything she had to say.</p><p>Rio knew different.</p><p>She knew the look in her blue eyes meant that she’d absolutely run out of patience and kindness for her. Which was unfortunate because the game hadn’t even started.</p><p><em>“Baby,”</em> she wanted to say, <em>“mi amor, it meant nothing. Jump into my arms now and I’ll carry you in them with your son on my back.”</em></p><p>“That was a long time ago,” Rio said instead, watching now as Agatha’s gaze was downturned and she was focusing somewhere around where Nick’s knees were by her sides.</p><p>“Bet you could still do it,” Wanda grinned and before Rio could stop her she’d stepped in and draped an arm around her, simultaneously hugging Nicky too. She heard Nicky’s soft gasp near her ear and before he could say anything she moved away, making it subtle enough that Wanda wouldn’t be offended, but far away enough so that her hand fell and Nicky simply held on tighter to her.</p><p>There was silence in the group for a second, Wanda oblivious to how close to the danger zone she currently was and Rio completely aware of it.</p><p>“Let me go find someone and ask for drinks. Nicky wants his wine.”</p><p>“Noooo,” Nicky giggled, back to being contented as Rio shot Agatha a quick glance and turned to go in search of a member of the arena staff. “No, soda please!”</p><p>Rio just hummed happily and bounced Nicky as she walked along the busy courtside row to find an attendant. Behind her she knew she’d left Wanda with a coiled cobra but she had no choice if she wanted to get them drinks before the game began.</p><p>Nicky had changed his position on her, moving his head from her left side to her right and Rio didn’t know but could only guess he’d done it to hide from the people they were walking past. The precious cargo on her back tightened his hold around her neck and as she swallowed she felt the press of his arms against her throat.</p><p>He was nervous.</p><p>The attendant was close so Rio hitched Nicky up a little and called for his attention, aware now that some fuckwad in the crowd was calling for <em>Nicky</em>. She held him tighter.</p><p>“Hey,” the kid turned to Rio and grinned, showing off his braces. “Can I order with you? We just want-…”</p><p>“Oh, I, uh, maybe, I, uh, maybe need to, uh,” Rio blinked as the kid with the braces blushed a deep crimson but her mind was half on that and half on someone still shouting for Nicky.</p><p>Her windpipe was being crushed.</p><p>“Y’know what, nevermind,” she croaked, and turned around to walk Nicky back to the safety of his mom. Nicky shuffled against her, his hold now so tight Rio could feel herself turning purple. And she knew she must have at least looked a little flushed by the look on Agatha’s face as they arrived back and she moved quickly to help loosen Nicky’s hold.</p><p>Rio coughed and cleared her throat as Agatha whispered, “Nicky, honey, it’s too tight.”</p><p>“He’s fine, he’s fine,” Rio reassured quickly, aware Nicky was scared so not wanting him to feel upset too. She stepped closer and pressed her cheek to Agatha’s to speak into her ear, her voice a little croaky. “Someone was calling for him. His name.”</p><p>As she stepped back she gave Agatha a pointed look and saw concern across pale features. “Rio,” Agatha was saying as Rio moved back to gently encourage Nicky to put his feet down on the seat and let go, “did you get the guy?”</p><p>“What’s happening?” Wanda stood up, looking between Rio and Agatha as Rio continued now to gently convince Nicky to let go and Agatha was frowning down at her where she still crouched.</p><p>“It’s fine. He was just a kid, couldn’t have got us booze anyway. I’ll go.”</p><p>She managed to release Nicky’s arms from her neck and turned to help him jump down from the seat just as two pairs of hands found her arms and she now stood with Wanda and Agatha holding her right arm and Nicky clinging to her left.</p><p>It would be the dream scenario if Wanda just let go and the crowd disappeared.</p><p>“I’ll go with you,” Wanda offered with a smile as Rio turned to her.</p><p>“No, I’ll go I-…” but Agatha clamped her mouth shut, clearly suddenly realising what Rio already had; that she wouldn’t leave Nicky alone with Wanda. “No. Get someone else. Or we’ll just-…”</p><p>“It’s fine, Agatha. Wanda and I will go.”</p><p>“Rio,” Nicky began to tug now as Agatha’s grip tightened and she felt the similarities between them both exacting against her arms. “Don’t go. Stay. Send the lady, okay?”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and felt Wanda’s gentler hold drop from her arm as Agatha kept hers tight. She wanted it to stay like that forever. But as she focused on Nicky and ducked down to speak directly to him Agatha cleared her throat and released her.</p><p>“Honey, her name is Wanda. And I’ll only be five minutes. I’ll be back before the game begins and I’ll bring you a hot dog <em>and</em> popcorn, okay?”</p><p>Her hand now free she could cup Nicky’s cheek and smooth down the blush she found there with her thumb. “I promise. Five minutes.”</p><p>Nicky’s frown spoke volumes but he nodded and Agatha was with him before Rio could say anything else. She was straightening as Agatha took her hand and made her pause for a second, “Be careful, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand was cooler than her own. She’d felt it before against her arm, but in her had now it felt like ice. But her gaze was warm, her gaze was that soft way it became when it was just the two of them; when they didn’t have thousands of witnesses to their every move.</p><p>Rio smiled and inclined her head to let Agatha know she <em>would</em> take care, that she <em>would</em> be careful. She didn’t pull away until Agatha dropped her hold and she could turn around to offer Wanda her smile instead. Wanda returned it tenfold and Rio relaxed just a little as she took her by the arm and pulled her in the direction of the food.</p><p>As they moved Rio became aware of shouting in their direction again but this time it was their names and no longer Nicky’s. She could still feel his hold around her throat and it made her unable to respond to Wanda as she asked: “Is Nicky always this shy?”</p><p>She thought of her dad then, and felt the tightening around her throat more viscerally than even before. She’d once held her dad like that. She’d relied on him to keep her safe when she was little and even when she was older. And Nicky had Agatha to keep him safe but he sure as shit didn’t have a dad to do it.</p><p>Far from the pain in her head the agony was now back in her chest.</p><p>Nicky clutching her was a reminder of what she wanted, what she so desperately, hopelessly craved. Agatha. Nicky. The both of them.</p><p>Her dad. She wanted him back.</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda prompted suddenly and Rio blinked and was immediately back in the room. They were in the thick of it now, and Wanda was now tugging Rio in front of her, holding her sides through the throng.</p><p>Rio managed to smile her apologies as people moved out of the way for Academy Award Winner Rio Vidal in the line for the concessions. Rio grimaced every time someone asked for a photo but always acquiesced, allowing them to always ask for a second one if they wanted it with Wanda too.</p><p>They moved slowly to the front because of it but eventually, after many photos both asked for and taken without permission, they made it back out with Rio carrying a holder of drinks and Wanda with the hot dog and popcorn.</p><p>“It’s cute, y’know,” Wanda was saying as Rio was concentrating more on not falling than anything else. “How obsessed with you he is.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and shot Wanda a look, “Shut up. He just likes basketball, and his mom knows nothing about it.”</p><p>“Not true,” Wanda said with a grin, “When you disappeared with Nicky I asked her who her favourite player was. She knew the whole team and their stats. It was…” Rio blinked and briefly lost her balance, only just correcting herself and narrowly avoiding spilling a whole load of red wine over the steps, herself, and the man beside her in his seat.</p><p>“Like she’d swallowed ‘Celtics for Dummies’ or something.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and blinked down at where she could see Agatha sitting leaning over Nicky, clearly deep in conversation with him. Wanda couldn’t be right; Agatha knew nothing about basketball.</p><p>Then again, if anyone were going to swallow ‘Celtics for Dummies’ simply to be able to have a conversation with her child about his favourite team, it would be Agatha.</p><p>Wanda continued to chat to her but Rio wasn’t really listening as they continued on their way to the floor. Around them people turned to look, some pausing their own conversations to do so, and others taking their cellphones out to snap a picture.</p><p>It was worse than it used to be, that was for sure.</p><p>When they were finally down with Agatha and Nicky again, Rio was surprised by the reception, or lack thereof. Agatha had turned to witness her safe arrival and Nicky sat staring at his knees beside her.</p><p>It was only as Rio went to hand Nicky his soda that she knew something was off. “Mellizo? Your soda?”</p><p>“I’m okay, thank you.”</p><p>“Honey.” / “Sweetheart.”</p><p>“Hey, Nicky? You want your hot dog or popcorn first?”</p><p>Nicky looked up at Wanda and Rio watched as she smiled and Nicky frowned. Agatha had her hand on his head and whispered something in his ear that made Nicky nod a little and swallow before he said, “Hot dog please, thank you.”</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip as she turned her attention to the wine she had by her feet and began to pass that out first to Wanda, then to Agatha. Wanda had taken hers with just a smile and Agatha had taken hers without one.</p><p>It made Rio pause, unsure what had happened between her leaving and returning. But she lifted her own wine from the holder and placed Nicky’s soda down by his feet and just as she was turning to slide the holder beneath the seats Agatha said: “Honey, why don’t you tell Rio what else you got for your birthday?”</p><p>Rio looked to Nicky who was still frowning, two bites now through his hotdog. There was a little mustard on his chin that Agatha gently wiped off as Nicky kept his gaze down and his brow furrowed. “New sneakers and a bike.”</p><p>“A bike?!” Rio gasped dramatically and brown eyes darted up to look at her and a flicker of a smile tugged at Nicky’s lips.</p><p>“A green one.”</p><p>“No way.”</p><p>“Yeah, and it’s got black handles.”</p><p>“Woah!” The flicker grew into a flame as Nicky looked up properly this time and grinned proudly at Rio as she asked, “How fast does it go?”</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Rio laughed at the sight of Nicky’s face all lit up and his hot dog held up to emphasise just <em>how fast</em> his bike went. And Agatha was smiling again, looking relieved more than anything as Rio took her seat back beside Nicky.</p><p>“You’ll come see it soon?”</p><p>“Of course! You can show me how fast you can go.”</p><p>Nicky nodded enthusiastically and Rio hummed her pleasure before she ducked down to look below the seats in search of the her little black bag she’d abandoned earlier.</p><p>She found it and ripped it out to hold it triumphantly up for Nicky. “Here! I got you a little something.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes bugged out as he accepted the small wrapped package from inside the bag. Over his head Rio caught Agatha’s eye and smiled, receiving a wink back.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, her frantic heart relaxing to a steadier rhythm.</p><p>Agatha moved in closer, peaking over Nicky’s shoulder now to get a good look. Rio felt Wanda do the same over her own shoulder and she held her breath.</p><p>Nicky turned the small gift about in his hands for a while and then gingerly began to rip the wrappings. Rio had never been the best at wrapping gifts so she was a little embarrassed that there were so many pulls for him to easily slip his small fingers into. Even so, he went slower than Rio had ever seen a kid when unwrapping a gift.</p><p>She blinked across at him as he finally, <em>finally</em>, revealed the box and held it up before his eyes. It was a small box, and in opening it, wide eyes the colour of warm caramel looked down on a green and white Casio Baby G Watch.</p><p>Wanda’s hand was on her arm and the grip of it helped her not to faint. She’d never been this nervous giving a gift before.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and cautiously asked, “Do you like it? I wasn’t sure but then…” she swallowed again and the pulled the sleeve of her sweatshirt back to reveal a matching watch on her wrist. “I thought we could be matching.”</p><p>Nicky blinked and Rio thought he was going to tell her that, no, he didn’t like it, that, no, he didn’t want to be matching, but instead he leapt up and made her grunt as he threw his arms around her neck again. He only narrowly avoided whacking Wanda with the box.</p><p>“Me encanta, melliza!”</p><p>Rio breathed out a relieved laugh and met Agatha’s proud gaze as she squeezed Nicky to her, “Sí, mellizo? ¿Me lo pongo?“ <em>Shall I put it on?</em></p><p>Nicky nodded against her and then pulled back. Rio took the gift from him and extracted the watch as Nicky held out both wrists and frowned between them. It took rio a second to realise what the problem was and she looked up to Agatha as the actress leant in and whispered something into his ear and Nicky nodded and then held only his left wrist up. “I’m ampidextris.”</p><p>“Is that right?” Rio shot Agatha an amused grin and Agatha rolled her eyes with a laugh before she leant in to kiss her son’s cheek. Rio gently attached the watch to his wrist and adjusted it for comfort as Agatha corrected him.</p><p>“Ambidextrous, honey.”</p><p>“Ambi-Ambidextrous, ambidextrous, ambidextrous,” he diligently repeated to himself.</p><p>“Feel okay?”</p><p>Rio watched with a grin that matched Nicky’s as he held up his new watch to admire it. “¿Cómo se dice: watch?”</p><p>“Reloj,” Rio uttered proudly, watching as Nicky brought his new reloj down to hold beside Rio’s.</p><p>“Reloj,” he whispered to himself, watching the seconds tick by on both faces. “Reloj, reloj.”</p><p>“Your Spanish is getting good, mellizo.”</p><p>Nicky raised his gaze up and beamed that toothy grin, “It is?”</p><p>“Mmhm. You’re already better than me and soon you’ll even be better than your mama.”</p><p>Nicky giggled as Agatha took hold of him and tickled his sides, “Nooooo!”</p><p>When she’d given in and finished the attack with a quick kiss and adjusted his now wonky cap, Agatha said: “Tell Rio why you’re learning it.”</p><p>Blue eyes flashed up at the request and the look in them told Rio that she might need to hold onto something. Wanda’s hold was no longer enough. She reached to hold the back of Nicky’s chair for support and dropped her gaze down to Nicky’s in anticipation.</p><p>Nicky was panting softly and smiled as he adjusted his cap again and looked back around at Rio. His eyes briefly darted to Wanda still leaning around her and then he looked back up and said quietly: “it’s a secret. Just for us.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched as Nicky shuffled a little in his mom’s hold and then made grabbing hands at her to encourage her to move closer.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Wanda’s calm voice reassured beside Rio, “I won’t listen.”</p><p>Rio glanced around as she pulled away and reached briefly to give her a reassuring squeeze before she turned back.</p><p>She shuffled closer and allowed Nicky to wrap his arms around her head and whisper into her ear: “I know you’re very sad and I want to speak to you in Spanish so you when you miss your dad he can be here too. When I miss mama I speak to her on the phone and it helps so I…” Nicky faltered a little and Rio knew he was trying to fit such the two big, confusing concepts of grief and death, into his soft words, “I want you to still be able to speak his words with me, okay?”</p><p>Nicky’s hands were tangled in Rio’s hair. He was being gentle but he held her firmly, making sure she was close, that his words were just for her to hear. And Rio was glad he couldn’t see her face as he said them because her eyes were filling rapidly with tears and there was no stopping them as one slipped onto her breath-warmed cheek.</p><p>From her position she’d placed a hand down by Agatha’s hip to steady herself. The chair wouldn’t do. Her thumb was trapping the fabric of Agatha’s pants against the side of her knuckle and she was glad of the small piece of Agatha she got to hold. It felt like it was holding her whole self together, keeping her steady.</p><p>She turned her head enough to peak below Nicky’s cap and look into his round, earnest eyes.</p><p>“Okay?” He asked again softly, and Rio realised he was asking her permission to continue to learn her dad’s language, to use it to talk to her, and keep his words alive. She couldn’t think of anything that would make her dad happier.</p><p>Nicky’s gaze dropped to the tear across her cheek and he began to frown.</p><p>“I made you sad.”</p><p>“No, mellizo. You made me very happy. You <em>make</em> me very happy.”</p><p>Nicky continued to look concerned and so Rio smiled as best she could to try and reassure him. His frown continued.</p><p>A hand found Rio’s suddenly and the hold she had on Agatha’s pants was broken but having her hand being held was infinitely better anyway. Suddenly a second face was close by and Rio’s smile relaxed into something just a little more genuine.</p><p>“You know what Rio’s papa said to me at Christmas?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and caught Nicky as he turned his body to face inwards, his back to the court.</p><p>“What, mama?”</p><p>“He said,” Agatha whispered as she squeezed Rio’s hand, “That you reminded him of Rio. That you were smart and kind and he would be so proud to have a grandson just like you.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a soft breath and Agatha squeezed her hand again. She watched as Agatha’s gaze moved round to rest on her and she felt dizzy suddenly, as though she’d fallen from a great height and Agatha had been there to catch her.</p><p>“I liked him a lot,” Nicky whispered as Rio kept her eyes on Agatha, searching for the lie, for the gentle fib in there that had been woven just to reassure a concerned little boy. It wasn’t there. And then Nicky said something else, something that made another tear slip from Rio’s wide eyes.</p><p>“It’s okay to be sad, mellizo. We are here. We love you when you’re sad just as much as when you’re happy. Maybe more. Mama says because you’re sad you need more love so we can-…”</p><p>But Nicky didn’t get to finish his promise because Rio couldn’t bear it any longer. She dived at him. She lifted him into her arms and held him so close that he gasped, then giggled, then buried into her. Over his shoulder Rio squeezed her eyes closed and focused on the tight hold she was receiving back from Nicky, one the cold hand that had found her lower back, of the love she felt radiating around her.</p><p>Her dad would be proud to have Nicky as a grandson. He’d said it the day he’d met Agatha. The day he’d met Nicky.</p><p>He’d known all along.</p><p>She breathed out slowly and released her hold, letting Nicky settle how he wanted against her, letting him lean his side against her front so he could see Agatha and he could hold Rio’s watch-bearing arm and match it with his own.</p><p>She watched him for a second and adjusted his hat and then turned to Agatha and smiled, finding she was already looking at her. “Es cierto,” <em>It’s true</em>, Agatha whispered for her ears only.</p><p>Rio nodded and placed her chin on Nicky’s head as he began to press the buttons on her watch, making it beep and flash randomly. “Lo sé.” <em>I know</em>.</p><p>She felt a hand on her arm and turned to Wanda then, saw her holding up her wine and smiling, “To Nicky’s birthday?”</p><p>Rio turned as Wanda reached across her to hold her glass out to Nicky and Agatha. In Nicky’s sudden reaction, in his tensing suddenly where he sat, in the deep frown that appeared as he raised his head, Rio realised the reason why he’s given her the cold shoulder. He didn’t want Wanda there.</p><p>For a few, brief moments, he’d forgotten she even was. And now he remembered again, remembered that Rio had brought a friend to his birthday surprise. He stopped playing with her watch.</p><p>She made eye contact with Agatha and saw in her gaze the truth of it, that she didn’t want Wanda there any more than her son did.</p><p>“To Nicky’s birthday,” Rio said as cheerily as she could, now wrapping an arm around the little boy’s waist as she held him and slipped behind him to grab her wine. Nicky didn’t pull away and Rio was about to say something else when Agatha leant in and said: “To Nicky’s birthday.”</p><p>Rio toasted with the other two glasses and squeezed Nicky’s arm. She took a sip of wine and then ducked her head down to whisper to him, “You okay, mellizo?”</p><p>“Is she your wife? Like, in not pretend?”</p><p>Rio frowned and looked up to shoot a glance at Agatha and saw that she was trying to pretend she wasn’t but she was clearly listening closely. Sighing, she ducked her head back down and whispered, “No, mellizo. I don’t have a wife.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and toyed with his new watch. “She’s pretty and she is wearing your cap.”</p><p>“She is. And very nice. She didn’t have any green with her today, that’s all.”</p><p>Nicky considered this for a second and then asked: “Prettier and nicer than my mama?”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek and pulled back as Nicky frowned up at her. Around them the crowd was beginning to make more noise and Rio knew she didn’t have long to reassure the little boy with the big brown eyes.</p><p>“No, baby.”</p><p>“Then why is she here?”</p><p>“She’s my friend.”</p><p>Nicky blinked and in his eyes Rio saw him processing in real time, the cogs slowly turning until he eventually said, “She took you away from me. Twice.”</p><p>The cogs then kickstarted in Rio’s brain, as slow as Nicky’s had looked. She tried to think back to when she’d last been with Wanda and had Nicky there too. And the answer was right before her, in the sight of piercing blue eyes as she looked up to see Agatha no longer pretending not to listen to them. The last time had been London.</p><p>The morning after Agatha had slept with Ralph.</p><p>Rio had spilled red wine over Wanda and they’d gone up to her room after bumping into Nicky and Agatha in the restaurant. Nicky <em>had</em> met Wanda before but so, so briefly. No wonder he didn’t remember her, at least, not initially. Rio hadn’t much focused on Nicky that morning because she’d been more focused on the fact that the night before Agatha had left her on her knees.</p><p>But Wanda going away with Rio now to get drinks had reminded him of the last time they’d met. It had reminded him that the last time he’d seen Wanda, he hadn’t then seen Rio again for days.</p><p>Looking at Agatha now she knew she was thinking about that too.</p><p>Swallowing her pride she looked down at Nicky and forced a smile, watching as his gaze remained on her, and his brow remained tight. “But I always came back.”</p><p>“I don’t think you should be friends with her.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha said quietly as Rio asked a soft, “Why not?”</p><p>“She’ll take you away from me and mama.”</p><p>“No one ever could, mellizo. I’ll always come back. Even if I’m gone for a little while. I always come back.”</p><p>Nicky couldn’t have known but a great squeeze happened against Rio’s throat and down to her heart. She wanted her dad suddenly, wanted the one person who could never come back, even as she promised the little boy she always would.</p><p>“Nicky, honey, the team is about to come on.”</p><p>Rio glanced up again and saw Agatha looking that soft way she always did, her arm now reaching to snake around Nicky and overlapping Rio’s. Nicky turned from his melliza and looked to his mom before he pulled away from both of them and he clambered around in Rio’s lap, swinging his legs around to face forwards.</p><p>“Mama, come closer.”</p><p>Agatha heeded the instruction with raised brows and took up Nicky’s empty seat beside Rio. Wanda, unaware of the conversation that had just happened and that she was now not wanted by two of the party, leant over and grinned at Nicky, “How’s the new watch?”</p><p>“Good, thank you.”</p><p>Rio sighed out and kissed the back of Nicky’s head, wrapping her arms around him loosely as he returned his attention to the court and to the hot dog placed back into his hands by his mom.</p><p>Rio rested her cheek against Nicky and tried to turn her attention to the roar of the crowd and the music now heralding the arrival of the Celtics but a soft voice in her ear stole her attention away: “He loves you.”</p><p>Rio changed the cheek that rested against Nicky and was horrified that as she looked round at Agatha she could feel the threat of tears prick her eyes again. In her arms sat the jealous, shy little boy that Agatha had made from scratch. And in her sights was the woman who had made him, the only woman Rio ever thought about, had ever truly wanted, had ever truly loved.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened and closed again and Rio knew what she wanted to say but couldn’t with so many eyes on them so she forced a smile and she turned back to the arena with Agatha’s silent “I love you” floating between them.</p><p>By the time the game had begun, Agatha had taken away the evidence of Nicky’s devoured hot dog and wiped his hands clean for him and Rio had moved to the edge of her seat with the little boy.</p><p>Nicky was clinging to her arms when he wasn’t reaching back to pull her head forward so he could speak to her and Rio could only hope it meant she’d been forgiven for allowing herself to be taken away by Wanda.</p><p>Agatha’s thigh was against her own and Rio knew she wouldn’t pushed for more when there were so many eyes on her but she wondered whether Agatha was thinking of reaching out. Maybe she wanted to rub her back when Rio visibly tensed as shots were taken, maybe she wanted to kiss her every time Rio celebrated, maybe she wanted to sit beneath Nicky in her lap and be held by her as she held her son.</p><p>The first quarter flew by and the Celtics were up already which meant that Nicky was clapping quietly along to the music played during the break and Rio collapsed back in her chair and laughed out her relief, flexing her arms up to work out the tension.</p><p>“Thank fuck.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Rio grumbled an apology and peeked an eye open to see Agatha smiling as she fixed Nicky’s cap on his head. Rio watched as Wanda then wriggled the peak of the cap gently to make him turn back to her as she motioned her own stolen cap. “Twins!”</p><p>Rio held her breath as she watched Nicky’s profile. He was frowning again, weighing something up in his mind, and quietly, hesitantly, he said: “I already have a twin.”</p><p>Wanda was game though, a perpetual positive person, and typically very good with kids. She smiled still and barely batted an eye, “That’s right. Rio is your twin.”</p><p>“Melliza.”</p><p>“A very beautiful one, just like you’re very handsome.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha press her leg closer against her own. She pressed right back.</p><p>Nicky was blushing now, hiding his face from Wanda with his head downturned and Rio sat up to wrap her arms back around him, “Very handsome.”</p><p>“Rio is handsome too,” Nicky mumbled, “Girls can be handsome. Rio said so.”</p><p>“That’s true,” Wanda agreed readily and Rio knew she was pleased she was getting some words out of Nicky now. “She’s very handsome.”</p><p>“Not as handsome as my mellizo,” Rio sang out as she ducked around to kiss Nicky’s burning cheek. Nicky giggled and squirmed and suddenly Rio felt a hand slide in against her stomach and Agatha was encircling her son too, leaning around him to kiss his other cheek and add with an edge to her voice: “Both very handsome.”</p><p>Rio knew Agatha wouldn’t wrap her arms around her in any meaningful way and so Rio couldn’t do it to her either. But this way, both folded around Nicky, was good too. It felt familial. It felt natural.</p><p>It felt like safety.</p><p>But Rio didn’t have long to enjoy the moment as Nicky giggled and Agatha pressed closer. The game was starting again and they had to pull back to watch it. But Agatha’s hand was now against the back of Rio’s chair as she sat forward in it again.</p><p>She was holding her. Just with enough space between them to avoid suspicion.</p><p>And then there was a voice against her ear, a soft question: “Have dinner with us?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and allowed Nicky to grab her hands and haul them into the air as the team moved back onto the court. She watched Agatha, saw the shyness in her gaze and the way she couldn’t quite make eye contact and, as easy as breathing, whispered a soft: “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha did look up then. She looked up and met Rio’s gaze and Rio just knew that they were being watched from every angle. That phone cameras were pointed at them, that the world would witness the way Rio Vidal looked at Agatha Harkness like she’d stop time for her.</p><p>But she didn’t care.</p><p>She turned away only when Nicky wanted her attention again and threw herself back into the game with him as best she could.</p><p>Despite trying to concentrate she now knew she had to deal with breaking the news to Wanda that she was ditching her at the last minute. But she had to do it without Nicky realising it hadn’t been the plan all along.</p><p>So, as the play went on she leant over slightly to get her attention and whispered against her ear: “I’m going to have dinner with Nicky for his birthday instead tonight. Is that okay? You’ll still have Jessica?”</p><p>Wanda turned to her and in her eyes Rio saw a flash of hurt that made her frown and feel suddenly guilty but Wanda smiled and the hurt was gone.</p><p>“Of course. I wouldn’t want to deprive your twin of his favourite person.”</p><p>Rio hummed quietly and leant her head against the back of Nicky’s as Wanda rubbed her back affectionately. She made a mental note to send Wanda flowers or something. Perhaps a woolly hat to keep her warm in the cold of Atlanta. Wanda winked at her and she felt nothing for it the way she had when Agatha had done the same earlier.</p><p>But she loved her. She was grateful to her. Perhaps if she hadn’t asked her to come today she wouldn’t now be here with Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>When she turned back to the game she could feel Agatha watching her but she focused in again - for Nicky, if nothing else.</p><p>She time was called on the quarter Agatha made a move that made Rio turn to her. But she hadn’t been aiming for Rio. She looked at ease, free. And Rio found herself staring at her again as she playfully wrestled the little boy into her lap.</p><p>“C’mere,” Agatha grinned as she tugged Nicky to her and stole him from Rio’s grasp. Nicky clearly didn’t mind this and he laughed as Agatha tickled his sides and Rio grinned at the sight, feeling for the first time in days now, a genuine sense of peace as she watched them.</p><p>But it didn’t last long.</p><p>There’s a song, attributed sometimes to Kurt Vonnegut but created by the director Baz Luhrmann and taken from a hypothetical commencement speech by Mary Schmich. It’s convoluted mythology is at odds with its simple, repeated instruction: “Wear sunscreen.”</p><p>It’s a song that’s more of a guide through life, a song where, depending on who you are as a person, different lines will stick out to you.</p><p>One that comes to Rio’s mind now as she turns to Wanda is: “The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.”</p><p>Only it wasn’t Tuesday, it was Saturday.</p><p>Saturday in TD Garden in downtown Boston. A Saturday spent beside the family Rio wished she had and with thousands of people who knew her name but not her heart.</p><p>A Saturday where, upon Wanda’s warning of “heads up!”, Rio looked to the jumbotron and saw an unknown couple surrounded by a frame of pink hearts.</p><p>Rio stared at it, a sinking feeling in her stomach as the view changed and the whole arena erupted.</p><p>There she was, wide-eyed in her Celtics sweatshirt, Wanda beside her in her stolen cap and genuine grin. And, worst of all, just to the edge of the frame was a suddenly pale Academy Award Winner holding her confused young son.</p><p>Rio watched as if she weren’t herself, as if the Rio Vidal on the screen were someone other than the Rio Vidal it was happening to. Wanda’s hand was on the other Rio’s cheek. The other Rio had turned. And all the <em>actual</em> Rio saw were smiling green eyes.</p><p>Wanda was leaning in, tilting her head.</p><p>All she felt were soft lips as they pressed to her own, the feel of Wanda’s nose squashing into her soft cheek.</p><p>All she felt was a small hand grasp the back of her collar.</p><p>All she knew was the weight that comes with guilt and sinks your soul to the bottom of your stomach.</p><p>The crowd was going wild all around them and Rio pulled back, forcing a smile at the woman who’d just kissed her, vaguely aware of Nicky as he threw himself on her back again. The crowd were hollering and Nicky was leaning over Rio to reach for Wanda.</p><p>The jumbotron had moved on now but the foursome by the court side hadn’t.</p><p>Nicky was now trying to push at Wanda, his right arm tight around Rio’s neck again. But it was no use. She already couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“Nicky,” she gasped out, feeling the absence of Agatha’s help behind her. Her thigh was no longer pressing int her own.</p><p>She managed to take Nicky’s flailing hand and heard him make a soft noise of protest against her ear. “It’s okay, Nicky. It was just pretend.”</p><p>She managed to turn her body around and tug him into a tight cuddle. It took a second but she felt him relax against her as he sat side on, his arms tight again around her neck, his whole face hidden where he pressed in against her and his cap protected him from view.</p><p>Rio took a breath and then glanced at Agatha and saw that she looked almost green as she stared down at where Nicky’s legs were curled together. Her fingers were so tight against the fabric of her jersey that she looked like she were trying to rip it in two. Rio stared down at the ‘4’ emblazoned on it.</p><p>They were a long way away from the last time they’d been in this arena together. Back when Rio had realised she was in love. How poetic, she thought bitterly as she raised her gaze to watch Agatha work her jaw, that now she was here realising that she would lose Agatha.</p><p>She couldn’t say anything because how could she make this better? How could she say “I had to”, “I didn’t know”, “it just happened”, when all she really wanted to say was “Kiss me. Now, in front of your son, in front of the world.”</p><p>Instead she reached for Agatha’s hand, and found Agatha pulling away from her.</p><p>She swallowed, a soft, high-pitched noise escaping her as she returned her hand to Nicky and finally Agatha looked up. She was smiling, but she looked unlike the Agatha she knew. She was far from the free and easy woman who’d just been tickling her son. Far from the woman who’d pressed as close as she’d dared and asked Rio to have dinner with them.</p><p>She’d put her mask back on but beneath it Rio could see the venom pooling.</p><p>She wanted to know what she was feeling, wanted her to scream or cry. And then, she let her in, maybe five second’s worth of feeling, but it was enough.</p><p>Her eyes were everything like the sun. They burned bright and dangerous and Rio saw in them the fiery inferno of her own personal hell.</p><p>But Agatha looked away again and instead reached for Nicky but Nicky refused to move.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha whispered, now leaning behind Rio to speak directly to him, trying to see his face. “Come here.”</p><p>It was far from the playful pull that had happened earlier. Instead now it was a jealous take back. She didn’t want Rio to have Nicky anymore.</p><p>Nicky twitched in her hold and then she released him as he began to struggle to pull back and suddenly she could see everything that she felt in a face that was so like hers. Nicky still had his arms around Rio’s neck, Agatha’s hands on his calves, his wide eyes on his mama.</p><p>“I want to go home.”</p><p>“Melizzo.” / “Honey.”</p><p>“Just us,” Nicky clarified as the crowd cheered for something happening around them.</p><p>“You don’t want to see the rest of the game?”</p><p>“No I hate pretend I don’t want it anymore.”</p><p>“We’re not pretend, Nicky.” Even as she said the words she knew she shouldn’t have because Agatha beside her froze and Nicky frowned as he looked up at her.</p><p>The shouts got louder then and just as Nicky was about to open his mouth to speak Rio was jostled urgently by Wanda beside her and she turned to her wide eyes before she looked up to see exactly why people were shouting.</p><p>On the big screen again was the actress Rio Vidal and her mini-me cuddled up against her. Agatha had clearly followed her line of sight too because she was now looking up at the screen and putting on her best movie star grin as the crowd went wild once more.</p><p>Rio watched herself smile as Nicky looked up from beneath his cap and winced at the sight of himself so large and so public. He turned into Rio and hid over her shoulder as the image of three movie stars and a shy little boy remained for the whole arena to see.</p><p>Wanda’s arm was around Rio’s back but Agatha hadn’t done the same.</p><p>They’d once been tangled up together at an after party, Agatha possessively touching her in ways Wanda could only dream of. She’d had her hand on her neck, her thigh, and she’d leant in so close under the pretence of a whispered conversation that Rio still remembered the ghost of her breath against her lips.</p><p>But now she simply sat and smiled. Back then she’d been Rio’s. But this was now.</p><p>Rio’s fake smile widened on the screen and then it was gone.</p><p>The camera had moved on but Rio, Nicky, and Agatha, still had not. Wanda was laughing, a joyous, unfiltered sound beside her, but Rio was focused on the tight hold of Nicky, on his shoulder pressed so firmly against her windpipe, of the absence of everything Agatha.</p><p>“Are we gone?”</p><p>“Sí, mellizo.”</p><p>Nicky pulled back again and Rio adjusted his cap as Wanda announced: “I think I might enjoy basketball?!”</p><p>Rio shot her a small smile as Nicky turned to her, swivelling and dropping his hold on Rio to do so. Nicky’s hand found her hair instead and he breathed in shakily before he said, “Y-you can’t take my melizza away today. Rio is mine and mama’s and I want her here for my birthday.”</p><p>Nicky was shaking, it was evident in his voice as he tried to raise it above the noise of the crowd so Wanda could hear, and evident in his body that shook against Rio. His little hand clutching her hair near the base of her scalp tugged her a little with every forced word. Rio held him closer, tried to calm him as best she could.</p><p>“Y-you can stay. Because you… because y-you like basketball. But you cannot h-have her.”</p><p>Rio’s head begs to throb. Violently. She looked to Wanda and saw that she looked so taken aback she was lost for words. But she nodded and managed a surprised smile and that seemed to be enough for Nicky as she settled more against her again.</p><p>The trembling was dying down, but Rio kept her hold tight.</p><p>“Well done, honey,” Agatha whispered so only Nicky and Rio could hear as Nicky turned back to them both with a sad frown but nodded at his mom’s words.</p><p>“And then we will leave and n-not be in pretend, okay please?”</p><p>Agatha kissed Nicky’s cheek but said nothing and Rio smiled sadly as she said, “Never pretend with you and your mama. Never, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and lifted up to whisper into her ear, “You can kiss my mama, if you want. I think it would be okay.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio said, feeling her heart beating rapidly against her ribcage, “No I cant.”</p><p>“You don’t want to? It wouldn’t be pretend, I-I know it.”</p><p>Agatha had moved closer again and she was suddenly pulling Nicky from Rio’s hold and placing him down to sit between them. Agatha was using her own son as a barrier. The little boy looked up at Rio and stared beseechingly up at her, motioning now to his mom with his head, but Rio could only shake hers, could only smile sadly as she fixed his cap again.</p><p>“It can be confusing,” Agatha was saying as Rio broke eye contact with Nicky to look up at her, her hand resting gently atop his head, “Knowing what’s pretend and what’s not.”</p><p>Rio knew, even though Agatha was looking down at her son, that the words were meant for her. She just had to suck them up, had to swallow down the guilt and fear she felt, and had to turn back to the court as the players began to step back up.</p><p>Wanda beside her started up a conversation about the game, completely unaware of the catastrophic consequences of her actions. Together they’d managed to confuse a sensitive little boy and trigger the fight or flight response of an equally sensitive adult.</p><p>Rio leant forwards as the game began and with one hand twisted and twisted and twisted her hair whilst her other was taken by Nicky, now too sat forwards in his seat. Even Nicky’s continued hold on her didn’t stop the fear that was coursing through her veins.</p><p>She wouldn’t be leaving with them. Now Agatha wouldn’t want her to. Agatha might never want her near her son again.</p><p>Agatha might never speak to her again, might never look.</p><p>The dull pain that she’d been suffering all week crept back into her brain and Rio had to fight hard to concentrate, to look directly ahead, to fight off any and all signs that soon she’d be seeing flashing lights.</p><p>Breathing became difficult the longer she sat there. It was like there was a weight on her chest and with every passing second someone was adding to it. Nicky was still engrossed in the game but even his enthusiasm was somewhat subdued as the time ticked on.</p><p>Every so often, Wanda would lean around Rio to talk to Nicky. She tried with comments about the game, with compliments to his sweater, to the way he wore his new watch, but nothing elicited more than a soft “thank you” or “yes” from the little boy.</p><p>During these times Rio didn’t dare look around at Agatha, knowing if she did the weight would become too much and she’d be destroyed.</p><p>It was only as the game ended that Rio found herself moving.</p><p>The crowd roared for the win and Rio jumped up with them, Nicky by her side and quite literally jumping on the spot as he celebrated. Rio laughed at the sight, a second of joy peeking through her bleak reality,  and she hauled him into her arms until she felt him being torn away.</p><p>Agatha was resentfully tugging him into her own arms and who was Rio to stop her?</p><p>Nicky didn’t seem to think anything was wrong so happily hugged his mom as Agatha kept her gaze down, the hardline of her jaw telling Rio everything she already knew.</p><p>“That was awesome!” Wanda shouted close by her ear, making Rio turn into her for the pain it caused to her already throbbing head.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio couldn’t think of anything that was <em>less</em> awesome.</p><p>Wanda grinned as she placed her borrowed cap on Rio’s head and shook out her mane of long, red hair.</p><p>Rio just stood there. Useless. Pained. Wanting to die.</p><p>“Yeah!” Wanda flung her arm around Rio’s neck and Rio had no fight left in her anymore and no excuses to pull away. So she simply stayed still as Wanda swung herself around and cupped her mouth as she whispered into Rio’s ear. “I was really hoping you’d come out tonight, you know. I could take your mind off things…”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and looked up just in time to catch Agatha’s eye. She looked away immediately. But that wasn’t the point. The point was that she’d been watching.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and turned a little into Wanda to whisper, “If you’re getting at what I think you’re-…”</p><p>“It’s just an offer. On the table. If you wanted it.” Wanda placed her hand on her stomach.</p><p>Rio sighed quietly and bit down on her lip. She pulled enough back to look at Wanda and was about to shut her down as gently as she could when Agatha spoke again. Rio turned immediately to look at her.</p><p>“We’re going,” she announced, holding Nicky’s shoulders as he stared with the deepest frown Rio had ever seen on him at the hand across her stomach. Rio felt sick suddenly, the idea of Agatha just leaving making her begin to sweat.</p><p>She made to step forwards but found Agatha was already meeting her halfway, already pulling her in for a close but impassive hug. She felt her breath against her ear, felt Nicky between them wrap his arms around her middle, heard Agatha’s harsh whisper: “Don’t follow us. Enjoy your dinner with your <em>friend</em>.”</p><p>“No,” Rio all but vomited out, trying to grab Agatha as she pulled away and tugged Nicky along with her.</p><p>“Mama!” Nicky protested as he was being led by Agatha who’d swept down to grab their jackets but not paused otherwise. Only, Nicky was struggling as he walked before her, turning around to look back at Rio and looking as confused and devastated as Rio felt.</p><p>She could only silently panic and watch as Agatha and her son disappeared into the crowds.</p><p>Wanda was tugging her arm, making her turn around and Rio raised her brows at her as Wanda said: “Why are they rushing away so soon?”</p><p>Rio knew the first answer to the question, it was as simple as a kiss. But there was another answer too, another, much worse answer that took Rio’s muddled brain far too long to come up with.</p><p>The crowds.</p><p>Agatha was trying to get Nicky out before the crowds became too heavy, too grabbing, too much.</p><p>She whipped her head around and saw nothing of Agatha or her son and the panic she’d been trying to keep at bay earlier flared again. Nicky was upset already. He’d be terrified now.</p><p>She turned to Wanda and as gently as she could she pulled away from her, “I need to go. I’ll see you later? Will you text me when you’re with Jess? And home safe?”</p><p>“You never answer your texts anyway.”</p><p>“Text Alice,” Rio offered absently as she went to grab her jacket and scarf and swung them on with her bag over the top. She kissed Wanda’s cheek and was about to turn when she was grabbed back.</p><p> “Rio, are you sure you won’t come out with us? The way she just left…”</p><p>Rio felt like she was swallowing down stones as she nodded, as she stepped back in and kissed Wanda’s cheek again, less rushed this time.</p><p> “I’m sure. I’m sorry. Thank you for… for taking my mind off of it all.</p><p>Wanda smiled her calm smile and Rio knew there were no hard feelings. She kissed her cheek again and then turned towards the masses of people making their way to the exit.</p><p>At the very top of the steps she could just about make out the back of Agatha’s head but she was so far away it could have been anyone. She ran to catch up. Only there were so many people now she couldn’t possibly get there fast enough.</p><p>Her name was being called from all directions but she ignored each request, each insistent hand, and finally managed to break through just as the funnel opened up to the main concourse inside the arena.</p><p>She spotted Agatha’s head again, saw the tense way her shoulders were raised, watched as people tried to get at her. It pushed her forwards, made her struggle through until she was just feet away from the mother and son.</p><p>She wasn’t in touching distance yet, wasn’t close enough that her voice could be recognised through the din.</p><p>But something happened before Rio could get closer. Agatha had turned around. She looked more frightened than Rio had expected. She was paler too.</p><p>She was looking for something, her panicked eyes darting about the place until they landed on Rio. Rio was close enough now to see Agatha take a sudden breath in, to watch as her brows shot up at the centre as if questioning what she was seeing. But Rio didn’t stop until she was close enough to count the freckles on her nose and to trap an equally panicked Nicky between them.</p><p>“I hired a guy,” Agatha began to explain, her breathing heavier than usual, her cheeks pink from the stress. “But-…”</p><p>“Agatha?! Agatha Harkness! Oh my god! She’s here!!”</p><p>It took half a second for Rio to make a decision. She bent down and heaved Nicky into her arms, wrapping one arm under him and the other raising to cradle his head so he could hide against her. The suddenness of the movement and the desperation of Nicky’s limbs clinging to her knocked his cap clean off his head but the swarm was closing in so it was sacrificed for the greater good.</p><p>Agatha briefly touched Rio’s hand that held her son’s head and then she nodded and turned and Rio followed close behind. Nicky was panting fast against her neck and choking her with his fear again but she kept her eyes on Agatha.</p><p>As they moved through, Agatha held one hand out behind her, holding it as if Rio would be capable of taking it.</p><p>At one point Rio had to push a guy away from reaching for Nicky’s head to ruffle his hair and Agatha must have sensed her stopping because she turned around and grabbed Rio’s hand and began tugging her along instead.</p><p>It was frantic and frightening but Rio kept her gaze on Agatha. Only Agatha.</p><p>They made it through.</p><p>Once outside, the crowds weren’t as tightly packed together so there was room enough to manoeuvre. Agatha’s grip on her hand remained vicelike, fierce.</p><p>But made it to a small opening and only then did Agatha turn properly to check on Nicky who was cowering and sniffing now, practically trying to crawl into Rio’s skin.</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha whispered urgently, trying to pull Nicky from Rio as Rio moved to encourage him to drop his legs. “Honey we need to go. You need to let go.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Rio began just as hurriedly, trying so hard to help but not wanting to hurt the boy. “Mellizo. It’s just us. Go to your mama for me.”</p><p>Nicky began to move, loosening his grip so that Rio could help him down and Agatha caught him as his legs hit the floor. For half a second their eyes met and Rio saw the fire back in sea blue. She saw the fury that Agatha had only just been able to keep under wraps and she felt her heart shatter and her head throb again.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she tried desperately, just as shadows covered them and Agatha turned from her.</p><p>A group of five men had approached from the side and without thinking, both Agatha and Rio stepped closer to Nicky, their hands crossing over one another to keep him protected.</p><p>“Don’t suppose we could get a group pic with you, ladies? Not every day you meet two such good looking movie stars.”</p><p>Rio had felt nauseous before but now she wanted to vomit. She held Nicky a little closer and was about to snap something when Agatha did it for her. “My son is with me. Get away from us.”</p><p>The man snorted and held up his hands in mock surrender but Rio knew he’d try again if they hung around so she grabbed Agatha’s arm and motioned with her head for them to move.</p><p>They walked quickly then, both still guarding Nicky as he jogged along between them. Agatha took the lead, moving as best she could through the crowds until they were in sight of a black SUV. There were photographers nearby, stationed out to see the celebs leaving the game.</p><p>A convoy of other SUVs suggested they weren’t to be the only victims of the paparazzi assault but Rio couldn’t care less about anyone else’s fate right now.</p><p>As they got closer Nicky dropped his head more and the shouts began.</p><p>It happened again. Amidst the “Rio! Agatha Agatha!” There were also shouts of “Nicky! Kid! Hey kid!”</p><p>Rio couldn’t control herself as after the fourth time of hearing the little boy’s name from a stranger’s mouth she yelled back: “Shut the fuck up!”</p><p>But they made it though again. The men had pressed in, clearly trying to rile Rio up once more. But she was focused now, focused on getting Nicky into the car as quickly and safely as possible. And Agatha had turned to her when she’d shouted.</p><p>She’d looked… grateful.</p><p>Ten more seconds of jostling and then Agatha made it to the door first and clambered in, turning halfway to accept her son into safety.</p><p>He felt lighter than usual as Rio helped to lift him into the car. His little body weighed nothing as she delivered him into his mother’s arms.</p><p>And then he turned, he reached for her, but Rio had to step back so the door could be shut.</p><p>Maybe it was the look on her face or maybe it was that she’d let go but without anyone saying a word, he knew immediately.</p><p>He screamed for her. A noise so violent that it made no sense in coming from such a tiny body. Over and over again he screamed her name but Rio had to close the door, had to watch as Agatha held him tight, as she kept her face forwards and her arms around her distraught little boy.</p><p>He was too young to understand.</p><p>“Rio! Rio! RIO! M-MELLIZA!”</p><p>As the door closed Nicky’s yells didn’t cease but they were muffled now, blocked by the metal and plastic barrier between them. Rio could see movement inside the car but only the shadowy figures of her loves hidden from her sight.</p><p>The man hired to guide the two back to the car was nowhere to be seen still. Rio was left alone, turning from the car that safely held her heart.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio was ten paces away from the car.</p><p>Ten lonely steps.</p><p>Eleven.</p><p>Twelve.</p><p>It gave her time to think, time to process. Time to decide that she’d spend the evening alone in her hotel room, that she’d figure out to how grovel tomorrow, but for now she needed darkness, and she needed tequila.</p><p>She could hear her name being called from different directions but it wasn’t until a hand curled around her arm that she responded to any external stimuli. She twisted her arm upwards to release herself and strode on.</p><p>“Rio. Turn around.”</p><p>A man came at her from the front just as arm snaked its way around her from behind, tugging her backwards without her consent. Though the person now controlling her movement, now turning her around, now walking beside her with her arm around her didn’t need to wait for the verbal cue.</p><p>Agatha had come to get her.</p><p>Agatha was marching her the now thirteen paces back, opening the door for her, pushing her into the back of the car and into the clutching arms of her little son.</p><p>Rio hadn’t been able to compute the journey back, the arrival of Agatha. So Nicky crying against her didn’t get a reaction. She just sat there, her arms limp at her sides, her heart somewhere in this car, but unable to tell her what to do.</p><p>It took the slamming of the car door and a barked order from Agatha at the driver to “take us home, now,” for Rio to come back into her body.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around Nicky until she felt Agatha leaning around, “Seatbelts. Now, please. Nicky.”</p><p>Nicky tightened his hold briefly and then released Rio but not before shooting her the saddest look Rio had ever seen. Her heart, now found, broke inside her chest.</p><p>Agatha was leaning over her, ignoring her completely as she helped a sniffling Nicky with his belt.</p><p>Rio just sat there. Unable to speak or say anything.</p><p>Once Nicky was secure Agatha sat back and Nicky broke the silence by saying: “You left.”</p><p>Nicky sniffed loudly and Rio looked down at him but didn’t make a move. His eyes were wide and red and he was fiddling with hands in his lap as he stared up at her.</p><p>“Nicky,” she started to say just as Agatha reached across her aiming for the buckle of her seatbelt. But if she were strapped in she couldn’t get to Nicky. Not properly anyway.</p><p>She pushed Agatha’s hand away and turned properly in her seat only to hear her name being snapped from behind her. But she ignored it. She ignored Agatha and took Nicky’s hands in her own as a pale one curled around her shoulder and forced her back against the seat.</p><p>Agatha was leaning over her now, her eyes wild with fury, her lower jaw jutting out as she stared at Rio and reached blindly for her belt. She fumbled, unable to see where she was reaching but Rio grabbed her struggling hand before she could grab the belt, forcing her to stop.</p><p>“No. No. I’m fine. I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t just stop what she was doing. She froze. Her hands that, back in the arena, had been cold, were now warm, fuelled by the fire in her gaze. Rio realised that the blue eyes that so often reminded her of the ocean were now the blue of complete combustion.</p><p>She was beyond fury, and Rio felt beyond hope.</p><p>Agatha was just inches away. So close that Rio imagined she could feel the heat from her flushed cheeks, the burn of her fiery gaze.</p><p>Nicky had looked up, confused, still sucking in shaking breaths. He reached for Agatha’s arm and asked a cautious: “Mama?”</p><p>But Agatha was moving again, diving for Rio’s belt buckle. Only Rio moved too, wrestling it out of Agatha’s hands and making a confused little boy even more confused as his mother and his melliza wrestled beside him.</p><p>Rio grunted with the effort of it. And Agatha, Agatha gnashed her teeth and managed to overpower her, eventually ripping her hands away coming down hard on Rio’s chest, pressing her firmly against the back of the seat.</p><p>Rio was gasping for breath, her chest rising and falling with Agatha’s splayed fingers across it. The tip of her ring finger was in the hollow of her throat and Rio could feel the heat of it. So attuned to Agatha now that she could feel the twitch of it, the infinitesimal movement that told her Agatha was torn between caressing and strangling her.</p><p>They stared. Rio’s eyes wide in shock, Agatha’s blue eyes still flaming their fury at her.</p><p>And then… “Lo siento, mi vida.”</p><p>Rio whispered the words, still trying to catch her breath, still trying to calm her racing heart.</p><p>“Mi vida,” Nicky imitated quietly, reaching his hand out to touch Agatha’s arm. If either of the two women locked on each other looked around at the little boy beside them they’d see the panic in his eyes.</p><p>But somethings can’t be turned away from.</p><p>Agatha began to move again, the hand not on Rio’s chest still curled around her belt buckle. She went to move it and Rio’s hand snapped out and stopped her even as Agatha applied more pressure to her chest.</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said just as softly as his repeated words of Rio’s.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and relaxed her fingers so Agatha could pull the seatbelt over her and lock it in at her hip. Her hand had moved from her chest now but she still felt the pressure of it, the memory of Agatha’s palm pressed tight to her sternum.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, felt Agatha leaning over her fully now to get to Nicky. She wasn’t pressing against her but Rio knew what her body felt like, knew how it would feel if she were.</p><p>Nicky sniffled and Rio turned slowly to look at him, seeing Agatha gently wipe his tears with her sleeve. “Mi vida,” he said quietly again, sniffing as Agatha pulled away and sat back properly.</p><p>Rio turned then to try and catch Agatha’s gaze, to get a read on the situation. But Agatha didn’t look up. She simply locked her own belt in and blindly reached across Rio for Nicky to take her hand.</p><p>Rio sat between them, her eyes down on the arm that now lay across her but barely made contact. It was Nicky again who broke her from her silent reverie.</p><p>“You left us.”</p><p>Rio turned and first glanced at the way Nicky was toying with Agatha’s fingers and then looked up to see his wide-eyed gaze.</p><p>“I-…”</p><p>“Rio went back to find your cap, honey.”</p><p>Agatha moved her arm just a fraction of an inch to press into Rio’s stomach. It felt like a warning.</p><p>She nodded, swallowed, forced a smile worthy of her academy award. “And then your mama came and told me you could just have mine. I didn’t mean to scare you, mellizo.”</p><p>To pay heed to her lie she removed the cap from her head and placed it on Nicky’s but the little boy still looked uncertain and he looked down at his mama’s hand as he said: “Is Wanda going to come over for dinner too?”</p><p>“<em>No</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s tone was firmer than she’d ever heard it around Nicky and Rio watched the little boy glance at his mom before looking back to Rio. “Good. I want just us. Tres patitos.” <em>Three ducklings.</em></p><p>“Patitos?” Rio asked curiously as she took a shot and gingerly lay her arm over Agatha’s to cradle the joined hands. Agatha didn’t move away.</p><p>The pressure on her chest lessened.</p><p>“I…,” Nicky glanced up at her from beneath his cap. “I just learned the word.” He sniffed, “I like the way it sounds. Pah-tee-tohs. And… and…,” he reached his other hand to cover Rio’s, “And ducklings stick together and are cute,” Nicky said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world though something about this fact made him suddenly shy. He sniffed again and kept his head down now. “Plus mama said you are always warm so… so we can cuddle you for warmth just like ducklings do. Patitos.”</p><p>“Your mama said that?”</p><p>Nicky nodded as Rio turned to look at Agatha and saw she had turned her head completely to look out the window. Rio brushed her thumb over the back of Agatha’s hand. She still didn’t turn around.</p><p>There was silence for a while before Nicky said, “Mi vida is nice too. It sounds nice.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and Rio chose to say nothing.</p><p>“Mi vida,” Nicky repeated quietly, testing the words out for himself again. “Maybe after dinner we can watch a movie like we did before? Be all cosy. Just us three.”</p><p>Rio kept her smile up and nodded.</p><p>Nicky’s eyes were bright again as he looked up at her, his cheeks still pink, “Will… you stay? Will you, will you stay with us please?”</p><p>“I’ll stay for dinner, mellizo, but then I need to go back to my own hotel.”</p><p>“With Wanda?”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away then and Rio looked around to see if she’d turned yet but she kept her gaze obstinately out the window. Nicky tugged her arm and she reluctantly turned back, “Melliza, why do you keep leaving?”</p><p>“She won’t, Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha was back again. Her voice was thick with fury and as Rio looked around to her she saw her ocean eyes were tempests once more. “She’ll stay with us. With you, for your birthday, won’t you, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth went dry when Agatha met her gaze and she felt waves of panic wash over her. Her suspicions had been confirmed. Agatha had dragged her back for Nicky, and Nicky only.</p><p>“Yes, of course.”</p><p>She turned back around to Nicky and saw he looked concerned again, looking across at Agatha’s lap where she sat with her hands squashed between her thighs.</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said quietly, straining against his seatbelt to try to reach for her.</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha chastised quietly, moving to lean around so he sat back, “Sit properly. It’s not safe.”</p><p>“Rio’s here,” Nicky responded, “It’s okay now. Tres patitos. Ready for pizza and movies and ice cream!” He nodded encouragingly and wiped quickly at his nose as he said after a second of deliberation, “Mi vida.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and reached for Agatha’s hand but apparently without Nicky’s in between she just wouldn’t allow it. Agatha had pulled back, moved her hand to brush through Nicky’s growing, messy hair instead.</p><p>“Dos patitos y Rio.”</p><p>Never in her life had Rio wanted to be a duckling. Never before had she thought about how cute they were. She’d never considered their attributes: the fact that they followed one another, that they huddled together for comfort and warmth, that their entire worlds were tied to their little brood.</p><p>But now, as Agatha excluded her, she longed for the inclusion. She wanted to be a duckling, cuddled with her others, giving them her warmth.</p><p>“No,” Nicky protested for her, straining again against his seatbelt. “Mama, tres. Three. Three ducklings.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything as she pressed Nicky back into his seat and Rio remained silent also. She couldn’t exactly say anything. Though she considered quacking.</p><p>“Tres patitos,” Nicky muttered, frowning as Rio held her hand out to him and he took it.</p><p>Rio smiled a little as Nicky’s fingers curled around her own. Agatha was back sitting properly, her gaze out the window once more as Nicky said: “What is ‘mi vida’?”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip for a second and shot Agatha a look to see if she’d turned before she looked back to Nicky and said: “It means, ‘my life’.”</p><p>Nicky nodded slowly and looked down at their hands as he repeated the words to himself over and over. “It does sound nice,” he concluded quietly and Rio said nothing else as he toyed with her fingers.</p><p>The car became silent then, just Rio and Nicky frowning at their joined hands and Agatha looking again out the window.</p><p>It had been ten minutes all in until the car pulled up outside, not a hotel, but a building on a residential street. Rio leant forward to look out the window and check if it were a boutique hotel or else she’d missed the facade a few car lengths back. But she didn’t see anything to suggest a hotel was anywhere near.</p><p>Agatha was leaning across her again, making her pull back. But Agatha didn’t seem to even notice that she was there, instead helping Nicky with his belt as the door was opened.</p><p>“Honey, climb over,” Agatha had her arms out to Nicky after having stepped out of the car and Rio remained still as she waited for him to clamber over and out onto the street. She followed shortly after and watched as Agatha marched hand in hand with her son and Nicky looked over his shoulder to make sure she were still there.</p><p>Rio tipped the driver and then followed behind, hovering just out of reach of Nicky’s seeking hand until he said loudly: “Rio! Come here please!”</p><p>Rio hurried to take his hand then and the boy frowned as if he were frustrated with the lack of expediency.</p><p>They were in Beacon Hill, a historic, quaint suburb and Rio was surprised when Agatha let them in to the double-fronted door of the building and said to Nicky: “Welcome home, honey.”</p><p>“This is… your place?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha said absently, helping Nicky to remove his jacket and cap as Rio stood and stared at Agatha.</p><p>“Rented, you mean?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio blinked. She stared.</p><p>Nicky went to reach for the middle button on her jacket to help her out of it. “Hurry, Rio. We have to go see my room.”</p><p>“Uh,” Rio began to help Nicky’s littler fingers and quickly removed her coat, hanging it in the nearby hook as Nicky bounced on the balls of his feet and Agatha stood nearby, not exactly looking at her.</p><p>She swallowed and removed her scarf, taking her time in draping it over her jacket on the hook. Her fingers skimmed down the fabric, wondering if there was any way she could get Agatha to speak to her with Nicky around.</p><p>Turning back around she looked to Agatha first. She wished she hadn’t.</p><p>Agatha’s face was downturned, her jaw still as tight as ever. Rio thought she might have stayed behind if Nicky hadn’t reached for her hand after taking Rio’s as he began pulling the two adults along behind him like his personal chaperones.</p><p>“You bought this place?” Rio asked as they were pulled along, her eyes darting this way and that through the hall on their way up to Nicky’s room.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer and also didn’t look at her but Rio stared at her as they walked the stairs, journeyed through the hall, and then made it to Nicky’s room.</p><p>“Do you like it?!”</p><p>Nicky’s room was painted a sage green, not quite Celtics green, but the basketball hoop on the wall and the Celtics bedspread helped to tie the theme together. Nicky dragged Rio further into the room and pointed out all the important bits until he turned around and beamed at Agatha who’d been left to stand by the door.</p><p>Agatha relaxed, at least, her face did, and she dropped down to her knees to motion for Nicky to come close. For a second Rio let herself believe everything was okay.</p><p>Agatha was Nicky was always softer. Her softest self. She looked at peace when he was near, but especially when he was in her arms. The sight of it allowed Rio to play some of the pretend Nicky was so worried about.</p><p>Pretend everything was fine.</p><p>Pretend she had a place in the hearts of these two.</p><p>Nicky was pulling back and Agatha held his face as she kissed each of his cheeks and smiled as she rested their foreheads together. Pretend dissolved as Rio suddenly felt like she was intruding. Like she shouldn’t even be in the property, let alone the room.</p><p>She mumbled a soft apology and went to step towards the door but stopped in her tracks when she heard Nicky call her back and say: “Tres patitos?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and felt torn suddenly, torn between turning and faking it and leaving and living with the knowledge that she’d denied Nicky his birthday wish. Perhaps she’d remained still for too long, perhaps her indecision was obvious, but whatever the reason, Agatha was speaking this time: “Tres, Rio. Uno, dos… <em>tres</em>.”</p><p>Rio turned cautiously and saw two faces looking up at her, one of hopeful enthusiasm, the other cautious, almost suspicious. She sucked in a breath and dropped down to her knees, holding her arms out like Jesus on the cross.</p><p>“Quack quack.”</p><p>Nick laughed as he shuffled his way across and wrapped his arms around her but Agatha stayed still for a while, and Rio knew she was thinking hard about her next move. She sucked in a breath and then raised an arm to her from where it had been around Nicky.</p><p>Maybe pretend for one night was okay.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze properly for the first time since the wrestling match in the car then and Rio mouthed to her, “Mi amor, please.”</p><p>She didn’t move for a few seconds. And then, much slower than her son, she moved in.</p><p>Rio felt like she could breath again when Agatha pressed into her, trapping Nicky between them and wrapping her arms around her. Nicky giggled contentedly but Rio could have cried for it. Hope, as flighty as it still felt, wasn’t completely lost.</p><p>“Tres patitos,” Nicky murmured after a while, releasing a contented sigh as Rio turned her head more into Agatha, taking advantage of the proximity and Nicky’s inability to see them. But Agatha turned her head, pressed closer so their cheeks were together but Rio had no other access.</p><p>“¿Es tan mala besando como actriz?” <em>Is she as bad a kisser as she is an actress?</em></p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio begged quietly as Agatha pulled away.</p><p>Only she hadn’t been quiet enough because Nicky looked up now he was free to do so and repeated: “Mi vida.”</p><p>Rio looked at him and reworked her face into a smile whilst Agatha stood from the floor, “Come on, drinks and snacks before dinner.”</p><p>Nicky jumped up and hurried after his mom and Rio remained crouched on the floor. In her line of sight was a chest of drawers, sitting proudly with framed photos of Nicky and Agatha, with little basketball figurines and even a miniature Celtics shield. The signs of a life, of a family, were all about the room.</p><p>Rio was the only piece out of place.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>She turned too fast and fell onto her ass. Agatha was in the doorway, looking tense and hesitant. Her sea-blue eyes took in the sight of her on the floor, simply staring up at her. She shifted on the spot and then took a step closer.</p><p>“I got you back for Nicky.”</p><p>Rio swallowed and nodded, her heart was blocking her airway so she couldn’t speak.</p><p>“You told me you’d never hurt him.”</p><p>Rio scrambled then, rushing as quickly as her tired body could make her go. She reached Agatha and didn’t hesitate to hold her face, just as Agatha didn’t hesitate to hold her waist. But it looked more like she was doing it to keep her steady, than for any other reason.</p><p>“I won’t. I promise. I love him I want-…”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze to her lips and from the devastation on her face Rio just knew she was thinking about Wanda. About the kiss.</p><p>“Kiss me. Please. Kiss me. I don’t want anyone else. I just want you. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha breathed out, and Rio gasped, a sharp, sudden inhalation. She wanted to breathe Agatha in, wanted to survive only at the behest, at the grace of the woman she held before her.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>They locked eyes again and for a second Rio felt like all was lost. She’d lost Agatha. She’d only ever have her in pretend.</p><p>Only ever Christmas wives.</p><p>But then Agatha moved her face, she dislodged Rio’s hold on her and she pressed her face into the palm of Rio’s right hand. Rio gasped softly, watching it for a moment, trying to memorise the way Agatha’s lips parted as she breathed her hot breath against her. She could make out the pattern of her freckles, the curve of her eyelashes.</p><p>She couldn’t lose her. She had to try, had to make her listen.</p><p>Rio stepped closer, resting her forehead against Agatha’s temple. She took a breath and then whispered: “I love you.”</p><p>Agatha gasped quietly, her lips parting and closing against Rio’s palm.</p><p>The throbbing of her brain that had plagued her since Wanda’s lips had pressed into her own dissipated as Agatha held her closer. She was nuzzling now, tracing her lips and nose down until they found the sensitive spot on Rio’s inner wrist.</p><p>The touch made Rio shiver, made her duck her head down to try and take what Agatha wouldn’t give her.</p><p>But Agatha had pulled away.</p><p>She wasn’t looking at her now, wasn’t touching her. “There’s a spare toothbrush in the bathroom down the hall. Use it. Come down for drinks. I’ll pour you a wine.”</p><p>Agatha was gone.</p><p>Rio ran her hands through her hair and breathed out until her body was empty of air. She felt the dizziness of it, sat in it for a few seconds, and then went to do as Agatha had asked.</p><p>In the bathroom down the hall she not only brushed her teeth, but she used to mouthwash she found too.</p><p>Agatha wanted rid of any memory of Wanda and she had no problem complying. The kiss had been chaste, she’d touched her lips, felt the warmth of her cheek. But she hadn’t tasted her on her tongue, didn’t know the warmth of Wanda’s mouth.</p><p>She’d tasted Agatha, she knew the warmth of Agatha. She knew the way Agatha was so ready with her moans whenever she got the chance to roll her tongue against hers.</p><p>Even if she had tasted Wanda, she’d have easily been able to scrub her away. But Agatha? Even a she place the toothpaste on the brush she could taste her, she could feel her touch.</p><p>She blocked it out, finding it too difficult to think about. Her headache intensified.</p><p>Only when she was minty fresh did she head back down the stairs to find Agatha and Nicky. The condo was bright and airy with high ceilings and white walls. And she soon found herself in the family room where Nicky was showing off his watch to his mom on the couch. Before them lay two glasses of wine and a soda.</p><p>“Rio,” Nicky said excitedly when he noticed her arrival, “Come show mama.”</p><p>Rio moved across and sat on Nicky’s other side, only to have him complain under his breath and shuffle into his mom’s lap. He motioned for her to move in and when she did he sat across both of them and held out his watch for inspection.</p><p>“Mama, maybe we can get you one too.”</p><p>“Not really my style, honey.”</p><p>Rio remained silent as Nicky pressed buttons on both their watches and looked instead around the room. Agatha had never mentioned that she had a place in Boston. She’d stayed in a hotel before. But this place, it had pictures of Nicky everywhere, even one of Jen and Agatha on the sideboard.</p><p>It was lived in. Or at least looked it.</p><p>“When did you get this place?”</p><p>She turned as she asked the question and found that Agatha was already watching her. She looked calmer again, but sadder too. Rio shifted and turned her body more, doing her best not to dislodge Nicky.</p><p>“When I got the season ticket.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and smiled just a little, hoping to tease Agatha out of her shell inch by inch. “So you’re rich rich?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched but she didn’t smile and Rio sighed quietly as Agatha turned to heave Nicky off of their laps and onto the couch. As Agatha leant to grab the glasses of wine Rio reached to hold her, draping her arm over her stomach.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha was leaning back with the wine in her hands and she turned to Rio and in a single breath she said: “Sigo imaginándolo.” <em>I keep picturing it.</em></p><p>Rio nodded and twisted the fabric of Agatha’s jersey in her fingers for just a second before she pulled away and took the wine offered to her. In handing it over, their fingers overlapped and Rio looked up again to meet Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Their eyes locked once more and Rio felt her heart trying to pull itself from her chest.</p><p>She couldn’t get a handle on how Agatha was feeling. She was angry, without a doubt. But she was hiding it, or at least suppressing it, for Nicky’s sake. But beneath it, beneath the waves of fury in her stormy blue eyes was something else, something a lot worse than anger.</p><p>Rio felt her head burst with pain for the possibilities.</p><p>“Mama? Melliza?””</p><p>They both turned and Rio took her glass properly from Agatha’s hand as Nicky knelt up on the couch and grinned, “Is it pizza time yet?”</p><p>“Honey, it’s pizza time whenever you want it to be.”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up and Rio forced herself to focus in on Nicky. The very least she could do was to be present for him now. God knows she’d seen him cry enough to last a lifetime.</p><p>“But first will you show me your bike?”</p><p>Nicky readily agreed and Rio put her wine down and spent the next twenty minutes rummaging through her brain for anything she could say about bicycles. But it turned out Nicky didn’t need that much encouragement.</p><p>With Rio’s help he sat on the bike and pretended to pedal as fast as he could go. Rio laughed. She cheered. She praised the speed that Nicky’s little legs could take him whilst she held the bike steady.</p><p>And when Nicky was out of breath and so pleased with himself that he was practically glowing, Rio helped him down and turned to find that they’d had an audience almost the whole time.</p><p>“Pizza’s on its way,” Agatha announced when she realised she’d been caught. “And Rio, Alice is trying to reach you.”</p><p>Agatha’s face was impassive but Rio still felt the keen sting of her words and she nodded once, swallowing down her panic as she said. “I, uh, doubt my phone is even charged can I…?”</p><p>With a nod from Agatha, Rio stepped forwards to accept the phone held out to her as Agatha said: “Nicky, honey, go pick a movie to watch in the den, okay? Whatever you want. Rio and I have to do something first.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach began to churn as she followed Agatha through to the kitchen. She gripped her phone so tightly she wondered if perhaps she could snap it in half and therefore have an excuse not to make the call.</p><p>But Agatha left her for a second and Rio collapsed back against the counter, counted to ten in her head, and then looked down just as ‘Alice’ lit up the screen. She swiped to answer as Agatha came back and placed her wine by her hip.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Agatha, I swear-… Rio.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and sighed out heavily, “It’s everywhere?”</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?! It’s <em>all over the internet</em>, Rio. Did you think for a second it wouldn’t be? What the fuck! I mean, what the fuck! I’ve had Wanda’s agent on the fucking phone and I-…”</p><p>“It just happened, Alice. I-it just happened it-…”</p><p>She looked up and saw Agatha leaning back against the counter opposite. Her own glass of wine was beside her. It was empty.</p><p>“It’s a fucking clusterfuck, Rio. Six months ago if this had happened then, great! But now Jen has been screaming at me and Agatha barely said a word when I got her a second ago and-…”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio tried quietly, watching as Agatha turned from her as she poured herself another glass of wine. “I’m sorry. I should have-…”</p><p>“I mean it’s not like you could've done anything!” Alice was ranting now. “What? Pushed her away? Stuck your tongue down Agatha fucking Harkness’s throat?!”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes again, wishing she’d done exactly that.</p><p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. You’ve always been friendly with Wanda. You’ve always been close! It’s just that. Just that. We’ll let the fucking rumours swirl and-… fuck, Rio. Is Agatha there? Is she… holy shit if Jen’s taken this badly then-…”</p><p>Rio looked back up and saw that Agatha’s glass was empty again, she was wiping her mouth with the back of her wrist, her eyes somewhere near Rio’s knees.</p><p>Rio couldn’t make herself speak, she just stared ahead of her, let Alice continue to rant in her ear about ‘fucking vultures’. And then, Agatha looked up at her. She looked lost and unsure and Rio stepped forwards but Agatha just shook her head.</p><p>“They got you shouting at the fucking paps too. Rio you gotta not do that. You know how-…”</p><p>“They were shouting for Nicky.” Rio had found the voice again. “Of course I was going to-…”</p><p>The phone was snatched from her clutches and Rio blinked as she looked at the woman who’d taken it.</p><p>“Was it you?”</p><p>Rio heard nothing on the end of the line, and simply stared at a furious Agatha Harkness, somehow two inches taller than usual, somewhere radiating anger. She was so close now, so close that it felt like a biological imperative for Rio to reach out to her. She clutched at the sides of her jersey and Agatha didn’t push her away.</p><p>“<em>Alice</em>,” she insisted when still there was no answer, “Alice did you set up the jumbotron? Did you-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, watching as blue eyes flashed to her own. But before either of them could say anything else she heard Alice’s voice again, distant and tinny.</p><p>“No. Holy shit, no. The kiss cam just-… holy shit Agatha it just happens. I didn’t set-…”</p><p>Rio didn’t hear the rest because Agatha had pressed the phone back to her. Rio took it and after a second of looking at her Agatha turned, grabbed her glass and the bottle, and left her alone.</p><p>Raising the phone back to her ear she heard Alice calling out to see if anyone was there.</p><p>“She’s so upset, Alice.”</p><p>“Hey. Hey. It wasn’t-… I mean, shit, Rio. Shit. You went back with her. She got you to come back, right? I saw the pictures of her grabbing you. Is that what it was? It’s not clear. They’re all fucking out of sequence but Nicky wasn’t there so I-…”</p><p>“She brought me back because Nicky wanted me not because-…” Rio released a soft sob and hid her face in the hand Agatha had pressed into only minutes ago.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice said more urgently. “Rio, take a breath, okay? Deep breaths.”</p><p>Rio nodded and did as she was told, feeling her lungs expand and contract with each one until she’d taken five and Alice spoke again: “I’m handling this on our side. The PR will work itself out. Two friends having fun at a basketball game. I tried-… I told Jen it would help with any eyes on you and Agatha during the divorce but-… she can’t hear it right now. She’s worried about Agatha and Agatha won’t answer her calls. I don’t know why she answered for me.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, still trying to take deep breaths. “Babe, try and talk to her. Try and tell her how you feel.”</p><p>Rio nodded again, sucking in another breath until she said: “It isn’t Wanda’s fault. She-…”</p><p>“I mean it is a little.”</p><p>“I… if she knew about, about Agatha,” Rio felt light-headed then because right now it didn’t feel like there was anything more to know about her and Agatha. “If she’d known she wouldn’t have-… I couldn’t tell her I just-… I mean, I-...”</p><p>“Look,” Alice said in a voice that Rio knew as her ‘I’m going to lose it in a second so please listen’ voice. “I know she’s a good friend. I know that-… I know she wouldn’t have done it if-… Jesus fucking Christ. It was just a fucking bad idea and right now whether she meant to or not it-… Just fucking talk to Agatha, okay? Try to. You both want this to work. Holy shit my fucking girlfriend is going to explode with how much <em>she</em> wants this to work. So talk to her. Try to, I don’t know, reassure her. But, Rio. Yourself first, okay? It’s a miracle you’re still standing.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and pressed her lips tightly together when the threat of tears suddenly washed over her. She’d rather be a puddle on the floor but have Agatha than be still standing without her.</p><p>Rio made a soft noise as her throat contracted and then Alice said: “Get your girl back, Rio. I know you’re grieving. I know what I’ve said about her before and I know I… I’m sorry I set this trip up. I thought it would do you good to get away. Wanda’s fun and she’s easy to be around and I just thought… I fucked up.”</p><p>“You didn’t,” Rio gasped out. “I just… I just need to talk to her, Alice. I-…”</p><p>“She won’t want to lose you. Don’t think you’ve lost her. I told her I’d kill her if she broke your heart again so she’ll be too worried about that to actually-…”</p><p>Rio released a soft laugh and wiped quickly beneath her eyes.</p><p>“I’ll work on Jen. I’ll sort everything with the press. But I’ll come and get you if you need me to, okay?”</p><p>“What if this is it? What if-…?”</p><p>“She pulled you back. She-…”</p><p>“For Nicky. Not because-…”</p><p>“Rio, please listen to me. She fucked up. She did. And I fucking hate that she did but everything she’s done since-… just please try to breathe, try to not spiral. She loves you. You love her, right? It was just some stupid fucking kiss and you’ll get through this.”</p><p>Rio sighed out heavily and nodded. Alice was silent for a while and then: “Is your head bad again?”</p><p>Rio sniffed and nodded, realised Alice couldn’t see her, then cleared her throat. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Take some pain meds. Drink plenty of water. I’ll get you in with your doctor when you’re back, okay? And <em>please</em>, call me if you need me.”</p><p>Rio nodded again, said a soft goodbye, and hung up. She remained in the kitchen until her breathing was even, until she was sniffing less, and until her tears were dry. Her wine helped with the crying.</p><p>She took her glass and went out to find Agatha and Nicky and saw them curled up in the middle of the large sofa together. Agatha didn’t look her way but Nicky did and he grinned where he’d been tucking into a bowl of m&amp;ms.</p><p>“Before dinner?!” Rio scoffed as she sat down a couple feet away from them both. “That doesn’t seem right.”</p><p>“It’s okay on my birthday! You can have some too.”</p><p>Rio took a handful, though she’d never felt <em>less</em> like candy, and sat back against the cushions. It didn’t take long for Nicky to shuffle closer under the pretence that he was sharing his candy but Rio soon felt a small hand slip into her own and she squeezed it as the choice of movie, <em>Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse</em>, started.</p><p>They watched in silence for close to ten minutes until the buzzer went and Agatha moved away to go and get the pizza. When they were alone Nicky whispered to Rio: “Pizza is my favourite.”</p><p>Rio laughed and raised her brows, glancing up again when Agatha arrived carrying two big pizza boxes and two smaller ones on top.</p><p>“Pizza for ducklings!”</p><p>Rio shuffled to the edge of her seat as Agatha bypassed them and went to the kitchen to sort the food. Nicky ran after her and left Rio alone, staring down at her wine. She remained like that until the room was busy again with Nicky yapping about his love of pepperoni and potato wedges and Agatha with the dark cloud she now carried over her head.</p><p>They all settled around the coffee table and Agatha handed out plates and napkins. Nicky dug in and Rio grabbed a small slice and found as she bit into it and focused back on the screen another, larger slice was slapped onto her plate.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up at her as Rio looked over. She was looking straight ahead watching the cartoon as she ate her own slice. Rio knew why she’d done it but it didn’t make the food any more appetising.</p><p>But she ate. She finished the two slices, a handful of wedges, another handful of m&amp;ms. She drank down her wine.</p><p>Agatha said nothing the whole time. Only Nicky spoke, repeating lines from the movie or reacting to the more exciting scenes. He sometimes asked Rio if she were enjoying it, if she wanted more m&amp;ms.</p><p>And Rio responded but her heart wasn’t in it. Her head still hurt and she could feel an ache in her chest but there was nothing she could do. Not with Nicky so close.</p><p>Eventually they piled their plates and moved back to the couch. Nicky settled happily against Agatha and was so full and content that he didn’t reach for Rio who sat just a foot or so away.</p><p>She toyed with her hands, twirled her hair, chewed the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Perhaps if she’d told Wanda she was seeing someone, an unnamed someone. Perhaps if she’d turned her cheek at the last second. Perhaps if she’d been more forceful, been more exacting in her words and in her actions.</p><p>Wanda didn’t know. Wanda couldn’t have known what she’d done. She was angry at Agatha, sure, but her career wasn’t worth her anger. She wouldn’t have done it if she’d known for sure anything was happening.</p><p>Rio knew that. She trusted her friend. But the longer she sat with Agatha and Nicky just out of reach the more her anger built. She was suddenly angry at Wanda and furious with herself.</p><p>The energy it took to keep her alive at this point wasn’t enough to keep her rational, keep her hopeful.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice was soft beneath the intensity of the action on screen. “Will you squash in? I need to go make a call.”</p><p>Rio turned and nodded, accepting Nicky into the crook of her arm as she watched Agatha grab her phone from the side and disappear off. Nicky didn’t even blink when she left but Rio kept her eyes on the door to the little den and held her breath until she was back.</p><p>It took well over half an hour, well over the time Rio could actually hold her breath, for Agatha to return. She looked tense, much more so than when she’d left. But she didn’t look Rio’s way when she sat back down.</p><p>Rio reached across for her, needing just to see her eyes, just to know Agatha was in there somewhere, hidden beneath the fury.</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn for a while, but Rio’s hand remained on her shoulder, her fingers curling to scrunch the fabric of the sweater she’d changed into when making her phone call. Rio thought she wasn’t going to look but eventually she did.</p><p>Rio sucked in a silent gasp at the sight of her pale face. She looked tense still, her features carved from marble as her eyes darted about Rio’s face. She was looking for something, unable to rest her gaze on her.</p><p>Rio squeezed her shoulder and mouthed: “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge it, her eyes settling on Rio’s mouth as she repeated the words again, and then again. Agatha’s eyelids looked heavy all of a sudden and then her eyes disappeared behind them.</p><p>Agatha hiding from her always hurt. But this time it hurt so exquisitely that Rio saw a flash in the corner of her vision. She flinched and pulled her hand away to pinch the bridge of her nose and try to fight off the threat.</p><p>“Rio,” she heard movement beside her, felt Nicky shift against her. “I’ll get you some meds.”</p><p>Agatha had moved away and Rio felt her cheeks heat from embarrassment, even as Nicky leant up to touch one. “You okay, melliza? Too much candy?”</p><p>Rio managed a smile as she continued to pinch her nose, “Something like that.”</p><p>Nicky shuffled back when Agatha arrived back in the room and she heard her stopping in front of her, felt her lean in, heard her soft whisper: “Take them then go to bed.”</p><p>“No,” Rio’s eyes opened then and she looked first to a stern Agatha and then a concerned Nicky. “No. It’s Nicky’s birthday. I’m staying up. I’ll be fine just… a long day.”</p><p>Nicky settled back and watched as Rio quickly took the offered pills and swallowed them without the water. Agatha straightened from where she’d leant over and watched her for much longer than necessary before she clapped her hands together.</p><p>“Nicky! Off! Off the couch!”</p><p>The noise should have made her feel worse but there was something distracting about Agatha’s comically deep frown and pursed lips as she barked orders at her now giggling son.</p><p>“Upstairs! Blankets! As many as you can carry! Quick! Before I start the movie again and you miss the final fight!”</p><p>Nicky ran from the room screaming his ‘nooooooo!’ and Agatha relaxed herself instantly and dropped down before Rio, her frown gone, her concern back. “No te estás cuidando a ti mismo.” <em>You’re not looking after yourself.</em></p><p>It wasn’t a question, just a fact.</p><p>But Rio was distracted because Agatha’s hands were on her knees, her thumbs drawing small concentric circles. Rio wondered if Agatha even knew she were doing it.</p><p>“I’m doing my best.”</p><p>“It’s not good enough.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond but found she was being choked again. Only Nicky wasn’t to blame this time. Her breath hitched as she tried to free the blockage in her airways and she made a choking sound that made Agatha kneel up suddenly.</p><p>She pressed her front against Rio’s shins and leant forwards to adjust her sweater, pulling it closer about her. Rio was fighting hard to breathe normally, reminding herself over and over that she wasn’t choking. The garrotte tightening about her throat was imaginary but the pain in her head was very real.</p><p>A pale hand moved from her collar to her throat and as Agatha’s fingers brushed across her skin Rio was suddenly able to breathe again. Sea-blue eyes were looking down at where her fingers were still caressing the column of Rio’s neck and Rio swallowed thickly before she whispered: “Agatha, please can we talk?”</p><p>Agatha looked up and for a second Rio thought she was going to agree when her hand moved to brush a strand of hair from her face but then the heavy footsteps of Nicky stumbling back could be heard.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away or flinch even as Nicky dropped four heavy blankets on the couch beside them. And Rio didn’t look either.</p><p>“Blankets!” He announced happily and then made a soft “oh” sound, and whispered, “Sorry, melliza. Do you feel better?”</p><p>“She’s better, baby,” Agatha reassured as she finally tore her gaze away and smiled for her son. “Let’s finish the movie, then you can pick the next one whilst I get us all ice cream, okay? But get comfy first.”</p><p>Nicky agreed readily and suddenly Rio was being manhandled - not by Nicky, by Agatha. She was moving her legs to curl up onto the couch, placing a cushion by her side, moving her torso so the angle was more comfortable. She moved her as if Rio were a rag doll, as if she were completely incapable of free movement.</p><p>And as she stared up at Agatha’s impassive face, she was.</p><p>She was practically hauled to the very centre of the couch where she sank more into the cushions and Agatha settled Nicky in between them.</p><p>The whole time she didn’t look her way, didn’t say anything, but she made sure she had enough blanket to cover her and when Nicky began to wriggle she gently calmed him and whispered something to him that Rio didn’t quite catch.</p><p>Nicky settled then, tucked again under Rio’s arm. Just as Agatha leant to press play on the movie he whispered, “I like when it’s just us.”</p><p>After ten more minutes of cartoon action, something miraculous happened.</p><p>Rio felt the brush of cool fingers along the back of her hand and it took her a second to register but she slowly turned and Agatha was looking straight ahead, her fingers now gone from Rio’s hand. Rio reached across, barely a few inches, until she found Agatha’s hand again and she slowly turned it.</p><p>When their fingers interlocked Rio felt her airways open again and the headache she’d been suffering suddenly lessened.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. She didn’t flinch, didn’t blink, when their hands became one. She just stared straight ahead.</p><p>But Rio relaxed with the solid comfort of Nicky curled against her and Agatha now softening enough to hold her hand. It didn’t feel hopeful, but it felt right. It eased the excess of worry that had caused her head to flash, warning of an overload.</p><p>When the movie was over Agatha released her, giving instructions to find another movie as she strode from the room in search of ice cream. Rio helped Nicky to choose and by the time <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> was loaded, Agatha was back with a tray of ice cream.</p><p>Rio counted eight bowls and looked on in confusion as Agatha pushed the pizza boxes aside and placed the tray in the centre of the table. “Birthday boys get to choose their toppings.”</p><p>“And Rio too!”</p><p>“Yes, and Rio too.”</p><p>Before them were bowls of various sizes with various contents. The first two had generous helpings of chocolate ice cream, the third contained m&amp;ms. Then there were mini peanut butter cups, actual peanuts, pretzels, broken bits of chocolate. And then, Skittles.</p><p>“Skittles?” Rio asked curiously, wondering how they fit into the theme of the offerings.</p><p>“Skittles,” Agatha confirmed as she reached across to take a few and drop them into her mouth.</p><p>“Mama likes Skittles.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows at this and glanced at Agatha who was now apparently too interested in the Skittles to notice. Rio knew she was avoiding looking at her again. But Rio noticed that she was picking rummaging through them, avoiding at least one of the colours.</p><p>She cleared her throat and asked, “What are you doing?”</p><p>It was Nicky who answered, already guessing what Rio wanted to know: “Mama doesn’t like the purple ones.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up, just kept fingering through the candy as Rio said: “Your favourite colour is purple.”</p><p>“I don’t like the taste.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows but said nothing as she slumped back against the couch, patiently waiting for Nicky to be done piling his bowl high with toppings, barely noticing that he was also putting one spoonful of everything into Rio’s bowl too.</p><p>“There you go,” he announced happily, settling back himself as Rio kept her gaze on Agatha.</p><p>Rio glanced at her own bowl, then Nicky’s, then looked back across to Agatha’s and reached across to grab a handful, aiming for the section of the bowl with more purple in it.</p><p>She added the Skittles without a word to her ice cream.</p><p>Agatha turned with a frown as Nicky announced: “Oh no, Rio! Skittles are not chocolate!”</p><p>It made Rio laugh and she scooped up a big spoonful of ice cream with as many Skittles as she could catch and held it up to a horrified Nicky and an unamused Agatha. “To your birthday?”</p><p>“Rio,” Nicky said calmly, as if Rio didn’t quite understand, “Skittles are not chocolate.”</p><p>“But they are delicious and chocolate ice cream is also delicious sooooo.”</p><p>She put the whole thing in her mouth, narrowly avoiding wincing for the cold shock of it on her palate. She crunched. It did not go well together.</p><p>“Okay,” she said with a mouthful of food still, “Not good.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and Rio grimaced dramatically as she made a show of finishing her mouthful. Which, admittedly, the more she chewed the more she was brought round to it. But as she finished off her bowl she made sure to avoid the rest of the Skittles.</p><p>Nicky, somehow, finished first. He jumped back up onto the couch and Agatha with him. Rio took a little longer to finish and piled up two bowls.</p><p>“Leave them, Rio. I’ll get them later.”</p><p>Rio paused and then settled back on the couch. This time, as Nicky burrowed close, Rio relaxed into it immediately. Her hands were cold so she wrung them together beneath the blankets until Agatha reached for them.</p><p>They stilled.</p><p>When Rio looked at her she looked back.</p><p>“Your hand is cold,” Agatha whispered as the movie played on, her eyes on Rio as she cradled her left hand in both of her own.</p><p>Nicky shifted against her and muttered, “more blankets, melizza.”</p><p>Rio pulled a second one over and Nicky reached over to tuck her in by her side. It felt good, she realised as Agatha squeezed her hand and ran her nails along the inside of her forearm, to be looked after like this.</p><p>Casually.</p><p>Calmly.</p><p>As if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Agatha had looked away again and Nicky was focused in on the movie so Rio settled back more, allowing herself to relax. She rested her head back against the couch and, not interested in cartoon dragons, focused instead on Agatha.</p><p>If she had a brain cell to spare to think about it she may have been mortified at what she was doing. But she didn’t, so she wasn’t.</p><p>She simply watched her as she focused in on the screen, as her jaw twitched occasionally. She watched as she settled back a little more, a little closer.</p><p>She watched as she absolutely, positively, did not look her way.</p><p>Her brain was whirring still, but slower, her thoughts now more at ease with the sight of Agatha soothing them until she simply fell asleep.</p><p>“Rio,” Nicky’s light voice helped to rouse her, “Rio it’s bedtime.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly and found that her vision was blocked, not by the lights, but by Nicky’s face about an inch from her own. He grinned when she opened her eyes properly and continued to whisper: “Mama said to leave you until the movie was done and she’d put away the dishes.”</p><p>Rio grunted and Nicky threw himself at her, taking advantage of her slow movements so he could get a proper hug. Rio grunted again but this time from the knee that hit her stomach and she just about managed to right herself as she wrapped her arms around the little boy and asked, “¿Qué es esto, mellizo?” <em>What is this?</em></p><p>Nicky was silent for a second before he whispered, “I lied. Just a little though.”</p><p>Rio frowned as Nicky wriggled back and his grin had morphed into a deep, guilty frown. “Mama said not to wake you <em>at all</em> but I wanted to ask you a question.”</p><p>Rio rested her head back against the couch cushions and grinned lazily, knocking a stray lock of hair back from his forehead. “Then I’m glad you woke me. What is it?”</p><p>Nicky hesitated and then blurted out: “Will you be here tomorrow? When I wake up? I want you to be here a-and I don’t want you to leave please.” He looked shocked at himself but Rio just kept up her grin.</p><p>“Mellizo.”</p><p>“Honey, what did I say about waking Rio?”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened and then he dived under the blankets and shouted from beneath them, “I am already in bed!”</p><p>Rio laughed, a louder and more joyous sound she hadn’t made all night. Agatha rolled her eyes and made to move towards them so Rio did the only sensible thing she could do in the situation and she threw the blankets over herself too.</p><p>Nicky gasped and then giggled.</p><p>They were alone in the semi-darkness for all of two seconds. Just two kids, one little, one big, and their identical grins.</p><p>“Ah hah! Neither of you are in bed!”</p><p>Agatha had ripped the blankets off of them and Nicky squealed as he tried to clutch at Rio, hoping his mom would just give in and let him stay up. Rio was laughing again, holding the boy securely.</p><p>“It’s late, honey. Come on, you-…”</p><p>“No, mama. Please I want to stay up just a little bit more.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and Rio smiled as she turned to kiss the side of Nicky’s head. “Tell you what, if you go to bed now, in the morning we can go on a big bike ride, okay?”</p><p>Nicky froze in her hold and Rio raised her brows, glancing at Agatha who knew her son so well that she was already standing with her hand out. Not demanding anymore, just certain.</p><p>“We can?”</p><p>Nicky pulled back, his eyes wide and hopeful. “You’ll stay? You stay all night and then all day?”</p><p>“If you’d like me to.”</p><p>Nicky went a little pink suddenly and he nodded, lost for words, in either language.</p><p>He shuffled back, thinking that ‘now’ meant ‘right now’ or Rio would go back on <em>her</em> word. “Okay okay okay okay,” he repeated as she scrambled from the couch and the blankets to get to Agatha and her waiting hand.</p><p>Rio smiled at the sight and was leaning her head back again when the twosome stopped at the door and Nicky had turned back around to her, his frown back and his lips now in a pout. “But just us, okay? It’ll be just us?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond and then closed it again, feeling that same wave of sadness crash over her as she watched Nicky try to process his concerns. She slid to the edge of the couch and opened her arms out to him.</p><p>For five painful seconds he didn’t move. And then the kamikaze of love that was Nicholas River Harkness crashed into her. She scooped him up, squeezed him tight, and as she lowered him back down again she whispered: “Sólo nosotros. Tres patitos.” <em>Just us. Three ducklings.”</em></p><p>Nicky nodded against her and she felt him sigh heavily as if this little boy had been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. He nestled in and Rio had no intention of letting him go until he was ready.</p><p>But then, “Honey? Rio’s not going anywhere but you need to go to bed.”</p><p>Rio smiled as Nicky wriggled against her objectionably, “Even birthday boys need bedtime.”</p><p>Nicky grumbled but eventually pulled back. He shot a Rio look as if to make sure she was serious and then hurried off to his mom.</p><p>“Hasta mañana, mellizo.”</p><p>Nicky hesitated as Agatha began to walk with him from the room and in his best imitation he said a soft: “Hasta banana, melliza.”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek, trying her best not to laugh at Nicky’s attempt. He was close. He was trying. She didn’t want him to be shy about it.</p><p>She watched the two figures until they disappeared and then collapsed back into the couch.</p><p>Rio had been here before. Three times now. A triptych of waiting. A triumvirate of Rio Vidals all anticipating the executioner’s swing.</p><p>She’d sat on three couches waiting for Agatha to return to her. In this very situation, with this very same sinking feeling in her stomach. Agatha had always been taking care of Nicky, always left Rio waiting with no earthly idea as to what to expect when Agatha returned to her.</p><p>But this time, this <em>third</em> time was the worst.</p><p>Because she’d had a day where it was clear to anyone who paid enough attention that they could be a family. They could be a happy family.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t royally fucked it up. If she’d been strong enough or thinking enough, she could have prevented this.</p><p>She looked down at her hands and stretched out her fingers, twisted them about each other, tried not to think of her dad and what he might say to her. Something patient, something kind.</p><p>Her thoughts spiralled until Agatha appeared in the living room again. She’d been in there alone for over thirty minutes. Rio’s eyes flickered to the clock on the wall and to her surprise she realised: no, an <em>hour</em>.</p><p>She’d sat stupefied by fear for an hour and hadn’t even realised.</p><p>Time bends to no man and Rio blinked up at the hands that told her time had flown through her suffering. Maybe the universe, after destroying her so completely, was beginning to wink in her favour.</p><p>“I wanted to make sure he was asleep,” Agatha said quietly, and Rio turned to see her stock-still by the door, her eyes a clear sea of fury as they stared down at the floor.</p><p>Rio stood, watched for any sign that she was reading Agatha wrong. But Agatha hadn’t moved and she didn’t move even as Rio walked towards her. Only when she was a foot away did she turn and step into the hall.</p><p>Rio, always having been good at finding her mark, followed Agatha silently until they made it up to what must be her bedroom. She stepped in after her and watched with trepidation as Agatha closed the door quietly and stood against it.</p><p>Rio watched her as she placed her forehead against the wood, as her fingers splayed along the pine. Her mouth moved as if to speak, but she couldn’t find the words.</p><p>Finding her mark was one thing, knowing her lines entirely another.</p><p>“Sit,” Agatha said quietly, her voice an octave lower than usual, deep enough that Rio felt a chill run through her blanket-warmed body.</p><p>She took a seat at the edge of the bed and held her breath.</p><p>Agatha turned around.</p>

<p><em>“Sit,” Agatha said quietly, her voice an octave lower than usual, deep enough that Rio felt a chill run through her blanket-warmed body.</em></p><p><em>She took a seat at the edge of the bed and held her breath.</em></p><p><em>Agatha turned around.</em></p><p>“She took advantage of you.”</p><p>Her voice was deep still, as if the words were pushed up from her gut, instinctual, exacting.</p><p>She began to pace.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“No. She took advantage of you. You’re grieving, you’re vulnerable, <em>god</em> you’re practically catatonic!”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>. She <em>took advantage</em>.”</p><p>Rio made to move from her position on the bed. Twice now she’d tried. She kept bobbing up like a buoy in the middle of treacherous waters but she always sank back down again, sucked beneath waves of panic.</p><p>Agatha was still pacing, her mind clearly firing in every direction as her hands moved about in conjunction with her thoughts.</p><p>It reminded Rio of a Catherine Wheel, sparking off in every direction.</p><p>“And she did it in the <em>most</em> public place, a place where I couldn’t step in. I couldn’t push her off. I couldn’t-… <em>Agh</em>!”</p><p>She flung her hands up and stopped in her tracks. She was clutching now, her fingers buried deep in her hair at her scalp, her head tilted up towards the ceiling. And Rio watched, she watched Agatha take in deep breaths, watched her try to calm herself.</p><p>Inside her own chest her heart was cantering ahead of her thoughts. She couldn’t contain it, couldn’t make it slow or steady or stop. It felt like it was trying to vibrate its way across the space to Agatha. She’d felt this before. The pull of her heart’s desire to sink in to the other woman’s chest and nestle there. Beat there. Live there.</p><p>Rio could only imagine it would be happier with Agatha. That her heart, running now on fumes, at least deserved the comfort of Agatha. Even if her body couldn’t follow it. Even if she were left hollowed out whilst her blackened heart beat for <em>her</em>, for Agatha.</p><p>The thrum inside her body built to an unrelenting thunder as Agatha paced and seethed before her.</p><p>Cautiously, unsure if she should even try, she said: “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head in response, her hands falling limply at her sides now. “<em>No</em>.”</p><p>She still wasn’t looking at her, and Rio bobbed up a little again, still unsure if she should go to her.</p><p>The rustle of the sheets made Agatha turn, made her look at Rio for the first time since they’d entered the room. Her eyes were wide all of a sudden, questioning. She seemed to falter for a second before she released her words with the remnants of the breath in her lungs: “I don’t want you to see her again.”</p><p>At her sides, Agatha’s hands that had once been limp were now angular, taught. Her whole body was tight, and as Rio took a breath in she saw that Agatha was no longer looking at her. Instead she was staring at the floor, working her jaw like she wanted to break it.</p><p>She hesitated, fisted the sheets at her sides.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed again.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio tried once more, unable to say anything else, not knowing how to fix this. Not knowing whether to agree or to argue. Her fingers that had been clutching the fabric of the bedspread at her side twitched and then curled back in on themselves.</p><p>She was digging her nails into her palms now. The pain helped. It was different to the pain she’d been living with these past weeks.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha was staring at her again, meeting her gaze, and in the seconds it took Rio to utter her name once more a fire sparked to life behind blue eyes.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio didn’t understand, she couldn’t make her mind settle on any words she could say. Nothing that could help. Just “no no no” repeated in her brain, in Agatha’s voice, laced with her own pain and Agatha’s anger. She tightened her clutches on the bedspread, dug her nails in deeper, swallowed down her fear.</p><p>“<em>Mi amor.</em>”</p><p>Without knowing it, Rio had hit on the trigger needed to make Agatha move. She stormed forwards, and didn’t stop until she was in Rio’s lap, one hand gripping her jaw, the other clutching her hair and tilting her head backwards.</p><p>Rio didn’t have time to register anything except the soft weight of the woman above her, the pain of her jaw and scalp as she held her viciously. She whimpered without meaning to and her hands flew from the bed to grab at Agatha’s upper back.</p><p>Agatha was silent and Rio couldn’t speak.</p><p>Agatha’s irises were slivers of light now, shining brighter because of the blackness that almost consumed them. In her eyes Rio saw nothing but fury, emphasised by the tightness of her brow, the jutting of her clenched jaw.</p><p>Her hold on her tightened briefly and Rio whimpered again, clutching now rather than holding Agatha.</p><p>Agatha shifted, raising her hips a little to rise higher above Rio. She was looking down at her, and Rio could no longer tell what she was thinking. She didn’t know what she wanted. Rio couldn’t give her anything.</p><p>Agatha’s breathing was heavy, and her fingers flexed against her jaw as she husked: “Ask me.”</p><p>Rio whimpered at a sudden squeeze and release. She didn’t know what Agatha wanted her to ask her. She couldn’t think, could barely breathe. So she remained silent.</p><p>Agatha sneered at the lack of response, her thighs closing in on Rio’s hips as her hold tightened again, “<em>Ask me</em>.”</p><p>Rio began to pant. The pain of Agatha’s hold caused her cheeks to flush and her hands to grip Agatha tighter but she still didn’t understand. Only, Agatha’s eyes dropped to her lips and something sparked in Rio’s broken brain.</p><p>She gasped out, Agatha’s hold relaxed just slightly, her eyes still that same obsidian with an aquamarine frame.</p><p>She could speak. She found her voice and asked the one thing she’d been wanting to ask these past two weeks. No, her whole life. The question she didn’t want to hear a ‘no’ to.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she breathed out, barely able to make the noise, “kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold shifted then, her grasping fingers relaxed, the hand that had been holding her hair now cradled her head. Her other hand, holding her jaw, now caressed her there as her eyes moved about her desperate face.</p><p>Rio whimpered, her body vibrating now beneath Agatha’s. The need to rise up, to grasp at her just as tightly as she was being held was overwhelming. But her body was no longer her own.</p><p>Her heart had abandoned her and because it now sat reliant on Agatha’s lifeblood, on her acceptance of it, her body remained still, waiting.</p><p>“Again.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate this time.</p><p>“Kiss me, mi vida, mi corazon, mi alma.”</p><p>Agatha gasped quietly, her body reacting with it. She shifted her weight, moved to sit up more on her knees so Rio’s hold dropped to her waist. She was fully above her now, a goddess before a lowly pilgrim. Rio’s head was still arched back, Agatha’s fingers sliding into her hair.</p><p>Agatha’s own hair had fallen in thick curtains about her face and Rio’s lungs filled with the scent of her, hungrily trying for more with every breath she took.</p><p>Whether Agatha was looking for something, or waiting for something, she didn’t know. She only knew she’d look forever, she’d wait forever.</p><p>It happened slowly, as if they were stuck in time. Rio saw the moment Agatha decided to kiss her. Her lashes had fluttered, her breath had hitched almost imperceptibly, and her thumbs, now back and laid over her cheeks, had made their presence known.</p><p>A whimper trembled between them, born of Rio and swallowed by Agatha. But Agatha was nuzzling now, nudging their noses together. Rio wondered whether she was making sure she could stand it, that Rio wouldn’t simply disintegrate beneath her.</p><p>She could feel the warmth of their coiling breath between them, feel the promise of lips she’d not tasted in almost a month. Her hands confirmed their hold on Agatha. She held her more firmly, wanting her to know that she was all she wanted.</p><p>And then, flung out of time, Agatha kissed her.</p><p>Her lips enclosed Rio’s with a delicacy she’d hadn’t been expecting. It was a moment, a kiss, to be savoured.</p><p>Agatha reared up after a few seconds, raising her hips against Rio, pressing into her chest and breaking the kiss entirely. Rio gasped as she did, trying already to reach to kiss her again. But Agatha was too far above her, was leaning down but not close enough.</p><p>“Ask. Again.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands had pushed back again into her hair, her nails now scraping her scalp as she forced her head further back. Rio gasped for the sharp pain of it, baring her teeth briefly at the shock.</p><p>“Mi vida,” she managed, “kiss me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t bother with the softness from before. When she kissed her this time there was no nuzzling. She didn’t hold her steady.</p><p>She kissed with the hunger of a starved woman. A woman who hadn’t been fed for a month. She kissed Rio until she’d ripped moans from her, until she made them crash back into the bed.</p><p>They broke apart on impact and Agatha allowed it only so she could reposition herself. She moved down and found Rio’s jaw again, holding her there until she found a better place to grasp as she rested her body weight over her.</p><p>“I won’t share you,” she breathed, her fingers curling threateningly around Rio’s throat.</p><p>Rio was panting now, one hand around Agatha’s wrist, the other wrapped around her waist. “No. No. I’m yours, I-…”</p><p>Agatha squeezed and Rio gasped.</p><p>But Agatha released her, allowing her fingers to linger where they’d just clutched. Her blue eyes were darting across her face now, never settling, never resting too long on one particular feature.</p><p>It was like she were scanning her, to preserve her in her mind or to search for something else, Rio couldn’t be sure. But she’d moved back, moved up, was now seated over her hips.</p><p>Her hands were steady and purposeful as they slid below Rio’s sweater and found the thin tank she wore beneath it to guard against the chill of the Boston springtime. Her fingers moved beneath that too. It was barley a barrier but Agatha clearly took offence to its existence.</p><p>“In future,” she said in that low voice again that told Rio she was fighting to push the anger away, “I don’t want to find one of these,” Agatha tugged at the tank, “beneath <em>anything</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands were cool as they lay now across her stomach, making Rio shiver from her need for them to be other places, to do <em>more</em>.</p><p>She swallowed as Agatha pushed her hands tantalisingly slowly up her abdomen to her ribs and traced her thumbs along the underside of her bra.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Why, <em>what</em>?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t really think on the <em>what</em> of anything right now. Agatha’s touches had changed to a tight hold around her ribs and she was leaning over her again, applying just enough pressure to let Rio feel the weight of her without it hurting.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was shallow, and though she hadn’t quite acknowledged it herself yet, for the first time since the arena, she was pain free.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she tried quietly, unsure what to do with the hands that just lay beside her on the bed.</p><p>Agatha sneered, “I want access. Even a layer is too much.” Rio gasped as Agatha dug her nails into her sides without warning. “I need access to you.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, finally making her arms work as she grabbed Agatha’s. “You have it, always.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hands down again, sliding back to sit against her hips. And Rio’s hold fell to Agatha’s thighs. “Agatha.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Mi <em>vida</em>,” Rio insisted making to sit up and realising she was weaker than she used to be because it took far too much effort. But then her arms were around Agatha and Agatha’s arms were around Rio’s neck. And she felt strong again, stronger than she had in days.</p><p>“Yo soy tuya, angel.” <em>I’m yours, angel.</em></p><p>She brought Agatha in closer, explored her back above her sweater, watched as Agatha’s eyes surveyed and studied her again. It took a while, ten breaths, until Agatha spoke once more.</p><p>“Creí que te había perdido.” <em>I thought I’d lost you.</em></p><p>The sneer was gone, replaced by a deep frown, by downturned lips. And Rio inhaled slowly, as Agatha’s hands came to rest at her neck again, no longer forceful, simply holding her. “It was just-…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha insisted, “Before that. Because of… I thought I-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched enough to make Rio correct herself: “<em>Mi amor</em>, the night my-… <em>that</em> night was to be the last night I ever spent without you. At least without knowing that I-…”</p><p>Rio’s words were swallowed by Agatha’s mouth. Rio’s mind went blank, her body reacting where her brain just didn’t know how to. Agatha was controlling the kiss, her hand back on Rio’s jaw, guiding her mouth open, encouraging her head to tilt back, for her to give herself completely.</p><p>And she did. Without question, without stopping to think about how exhausted she was, how delicate everything felt, how close she always was to searing pain.</p><p>Agatha was here now. Agatha was siphoning all of that away.</p><p>Agatha’s body was moving with each renewed show of desperation. She was rocking against her, pressing flush, grasping and grabbing as if she wanted to be woven together so they could breathe their lasts into each others mouths.</p><p>Gasping for air when Agatha pulled away, Rio saw stars for the second time that night but they weren’t threatening or unwanted. The stars were Agatha’s doing: a galaxy of want and fury.</p><p>Agatha was kissing along her jaw, trailing swollen lips and a greedy tongue down to her throat where she made sure the stars in Rio’s eyes flashed their meaning.</p><p>Rio gripped Agatha’s hips, helping her rock against her with every pleased moan she made at the effort she was exerting to mark her neck, to claim her prize.</p><p>“Fuck,” she gasped when finally, after what felt like an age, Agatha was swirling her tongue across the column of her throat-turned-canvas.</p><p>“I want to write my name across your skin,” Agatha breathed against her, pressing up until she had her ear lobe between her teeth and Rio’s whimpers became more frequent. “All over,” she grabbed Rio’s jaw and turned her head so she could look down at the swell of her pouting lips. “So everyone knows. So redheads who try to take what’s not theirs <em>know</em>.”</p><p>Rio groaned as she hurriedly tried to get below Agatha’s sweater, just to feel her skin, just to make her arch her back and respond to her touch.</p><p>“I’m yours. I’m yours.”</p><p>Agatha nudged their noses together before she captured her lower lip and sucked. It made Rio moan this time, her own back arch, her hands that had been seeking now clutched.</p><p>“Baby,” Rio managed just as Agatha released her but not before she was already moving, already sliding down her body to begin frantically tugging her sweatshirt and tank up. Rio’s stomach was exposed to the cool air and she felt goosebumps as Agatha continued to lift the fabric over her body. She raised her arms and managed to help get it off and Agatha threw it across the room, her eyes already down on the expanse of skin before her.</p><p>She pressed her knuckles in against her stomach and though her eyes were hidden from her now she saw her shoulders fall, felt the fire die.</p><p>“You need to do better,” Agatha said after a few seconds of Rio just waiting. Her hands were now caressing her lower abdomen, exploring the goosebumps with a delicacy that made Rio shiver.</p><p>“You need to look after yourself. Eat. Fuel your body.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, wondering if this is where Agatha would stop, if this is where she told her they could only kiss, could only go so far because Rio was a mess and Agatha didn’t want her like this.</p><p>She made a high-pitched noise as she gripped Agatha’s hips, pressing her nails in to try and elicit a response. But Agatha only remained steady, only kept her eyes down on Rio’s practically concave stomach.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she tried quietly, the shibboleth needed to make Agatha lean closer, make her press her lips to her cheek then the shell of her ear.</p><p>“Let me look after you tonight.”</p><p>Rio shivered again, as Agatha’s whisper ghosted over her ear, and settled down between her thighs. It was a flash of feeling she’d not had in weeks. A reminder that she was alive, that she was in her body again, that her body belonged to and wanted <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>She gasped as Agatha pushed her onto her back suddenly. She hit the soft cushion of the bed below her with a dull thud as Agatha remained straddling her hips, her fingers back to tracing soothing patterns over her stomach.</p><p>“Will you let me?”</p><p>Rio’s breathing hitched as she grabbed at Agatha’s thighs.</p><p>“Look after you?”</p><p>Rio whimpered again, and began to claw at Agatha’s thighs as she repeated over and over: “Yes, please. Yes, yes, mi vida.”</p><p>Agatha moved slowly then, repositioning herself to balance on her forearm by Rio’s head as her left hand came up to hold her jaw once more. Her eyes were still black but they were softer, somehow more tender as she studied over her features, “Do you feel strong enough? To let me take care of you?”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to respond and found Agatha pressing her thumb inside, her gaze dropping down as Rio immediately sucked it further in. Agatha’s lips parted and her brows raised as she looked up to Rio’s desperately wide eyes.</p><p>“I think that’s a yes.”</p><p>Rio whimpered around Agatha’s thumb as she pressed it deeper.</p><p>Agatha lowered herself down and pulled her thumb from her mouth, letting it trail its silvery reward down her chin. Agatha’s tongue flicked out to clean the mess she’d made and she returned it to Rio’s mouth, forcing a moan out of her before she pulled back to whisper: “I’ve been thinking about you nonstop since the day you left. Thinking about all the ways I’d let you have me, fuck me. Feeling so empty without you inside me. How you’d make me yours. But you don’t have the energy to fuck me the way I want you to tonight. The way I know you need to.”</p><p>Rio began to protest, began to squirm beneath her with soft no’s falling from her lips like a prayer. A flash of hatred hit her dormant brain cells as she cursed the weakness in her body and mind. Her protests weren’t enough. She wanted to scream and grab and pull Agatha down and show her what she could do to her, how she could be good, how they could be perfect.</p><p>But she was too weak, too slow, for that. And Agatha simply curled her fingers inside her mouth, holding down her lower jaw to prevent her from saying anything.</p><p>“I even bought you something in the hopes you’d come home with me tonight, that you’d have energy enough to use it and fuck me so full of you I never felt empty again.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost rolled into the back of her head, her body trapped below Agatha’s, her mouth held, her hands the only thing that could move and make her desperation known. She gripped Agatha’s hips, trying to pull them flush against her own, trying to let her know she wanted that. She <em>desperately</em> wanted that.</p><p>Agatha was smirking softly, her eyes becoming less tender the more Rio tried. “But because you’ve not been looking after yourself, because you can’t give me exactly what we both want… I’ll give it to you. And I know,” she leant down, slid her fingers from Rio’s salivating mouth, “I know you want to give mommy what she wants.”</p><p>Rio choked on her moan, and Agatha’s smirk grew as her wet fingers slid down to curl around her neck. “Querido, I know you’ll try so hard, and I’ll help you,” Agatha trailed her hand further down slowly, shifting her weight and reaching between them to finger with the button on her jeans, “I’ll help you, I’ll take care of you too because I love you and I want you-… ah.”</p><p>She’d slid her hand down beneath Rio’s underwear, down to cup her pussy and Rio made a soft noise as her hips twitched and her breath hitched.</p><p>“Is this for me?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly and began to run her middle fingers idly through Rio’s dripping pussy, gathering as much slick as she could. The torture of it, the familiarity that Agatha had with her, her practised fingers mapping out where they’d been absent for so long. <em>Too long.</em> It made Rio shiver again, made her pant as she tried to claw Agatha closer to her.</p><p>Agatha was watching her with dark, curious eyes, and Rio knew she was seeing if she could handle it. But she didn’t have the words to form to say, <em>”yes, please, right there, stay right there, now more, give me more, please pleasepleasepleaseplease.”</em></p><p>Agatha tortured her until Rio’s breathing became alarmingly fast. But she knew how to make it stop. She knew how to make her gasp and hold her breath. She pressed just one knuckle deep inside of her and almost as soon as Rio had inhaled sharply and then gasped out she removed her hand entirely.</p><p>“N-no, please-…”</p><p>But Agatha was pulling away, ignoring Rio completely. Her movements were no longer slow and deliberate but instead frantic, almost manic. She began to rip Rio’s pants from her legs, barely getting them to her ankles before she made for her bra, forcing Rio to lift up so she could get to the clasp.</p><p>“I’m not done reminding you who you belong to. I’m not done. I’m not <em>done</em>.”</p><p>Rio was breathless and squirming now, and by the time Agatha had ripped her underwear completely away she was seeing stars again. The good kind, the Agatha kind. Agatha was gazing down at her from where she sat over her thighs still fully clothed and Rio groaned quietly as she tried to reach for her.</p><p>“Words. Use your words, my love.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, as Agatha’s damp fingers began to trace slow patterns around her breasts. She made an unintentional squeaking noise as she tried to find her voice and Agatha smirked because of it.</p><p>“Please,” Rio gasped, “Please remind me. Remind everyone. But let me fuck you. Let me-…”</p><p>Agatha had begun to undo her own zipper as Rio babbled, opening her pants enough so the hand she’d just been teasing Rio with could slip inside and Rio scrambled to sit up, but Agatha stopped her from interfering by placing her free hand on her chest.</p><p>“Consider it a promise,” she breathed between soft moans as Rio stared down at the hand now Agatha was clearly fucking herself with. “If you try harder, I’ll let you fuck me however you want, whenever, and wherever you want.”</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio grabbed Agatha’s elbow more forcefully than she meant to but it made Agatha stop her movements and she raised her brows as her hips did an involuntary little jerk. “Let me fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha seemed to hesitate for a second but then she was shaking off Rio’s hold, pulling her hand up and making Rio look at the state of it, shining in the light. “Don’t you want to fuck me well? Fuck me <em>hard</em>? Fuck me-…”</p><p>Rio had lunged at her, with more energy than she knew she had, capturing her two proffered fingers in her mouth and sucking them readily, gripping her wrist so Agatha couldn’t pull them away. Rio’s eyes did roll into the back of her head this time the very moment Agatha’s taste registered in her punch-drunk brain.</p><p>She tasted the same as she always had, a little sweet, but rich and warm on her tongue, the kind of taste Rio would never get sick of, would always crave more of. As her tongue swirled to clean more of it off of Agatha’s fingers, Agatha rocked her hips again, her free hand sliding across to grasp her throat once more.</p><p>“I’m taking care of you, remember?”</p><p>Rio whimpered as Agatha broke her hold and she was pushed back onto the bed. Agatha looked starved above her, almost animal-like as she crawled up her body and sank her teeth into the sensitive skin across her collarbone.</p><p>Rio couldn’t keep still anymore. Whether through desire or anticipation or frustration she shivered through the brutal attack. She was struggling to breathe as Agatha made her claim known against her collarbone, over her tits, her ribs, her stomach, her hips, her thighs.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t pause for breath, only working her way across the clean slate of Rio’s body, making it flare angrily in the places she’d worked her lips and teeth against. Rio followed Agatha down with her hands in her hair, continually gripping and scratching at her scalp with every inch she descended.</p><p>Until, eventually, Agatha was panting softly against her exposed pussy, her arms now beneath her thighs and holding them apart as she settled more between them. Rio didn’t have the energy or the brain power to make herself look down at her but if she had she’d have seen Agatha’s midnight gaze staring at what she had been desperate for all these weeks they’d been apart.</p><p>Her frenzy had died to a slow, deliberate yearning now and Rio moaned long and low as Agatha’s tongue drew a thick line through her soaked cunt, pressing only enough to make her roll her hips.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she groaned out when Agatha gave her nothing more than the panting breath from her swollen lips, “Please.”</p><p>Agatha remained still, and Rio whined quietly but soon forced herself to lean up. It took some effort but she managed it and rested on her elbows as she looked down beneath hooded, heavy eyelids at the sight of Agatha between her thighs.</p><p>She was looking up at her, like a coiled snake about to strike simply toying with its prey, waiting for it to turn so it could deliver its fatal blow. And Agatha was doing exactly that, waiting until Rio would look at her before she pressed her mouth against her.</p><p>Rio could only hold on so long though and she slipped back against the bed, lost to the feel of Agatha eating her out so thoroughly, so ravenously that she thought she might pass out from it.</p><p>Agatha had buried herself between Rio’s legs, manoeuvring her thighs up to clamp around her head, and Rio wondered how she could breathe, how she was still making her moan and roll her hips without seemingly taking any breath.</p><p>She came faster than she had been prepared she might. Weeks of nothing but misery and grief vanished in one, mind-bending orgasm. She must have squeezed Agatha’s head, must have blocked her hearing and forced her closer, but Agatha didn’t tap out, she didn’t protest, she just kept eating Rio through it.</p><p>Her whole body shook with the shock and force of her orgasm as she relaxed her thighs down, no longer trapping Agatha but framing her. She couldn’t lift herself again, couldn’t look down to properly see. But Agatha was running her tongue through her now at a slower pace, cleaning up the mess she’d made.</p><p>“Ag-… mi amor, mi amor,” Rio breathed shakily, “Come here, let me-…”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move until she was ready, greedily eating still, licking up every trace of Rio she could lap up into her desperate mouth. But eventually, as Rio quivered beneath her, Agatha moved up slowly, letting Rio feel how wet she was by pressing her lips to each fresh mark she’d left against her skin. She said nothing until she got to the oldest one, the <em>largest</em> one at her neck and she whispered against it, “You taste so fucking good. I want to be stuck between your thighs every night for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Rio whimpered quietly, trying to slide her hands between them to get into Agatha’s pants. But Agatha was pulling away before even kissing her, before Rio could get to where she wanted.</p><p>“Mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a second, the fire still flaming in her eyes. She turned as Rio reached for her again and stood from the bed, not even glancing back at Rio as she stalked away to open one of the drawers at the far side of the room.</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio tried weakly as she struggled to her elbows. Agatha had taken something out, was now standing with her back to her and shimmying out of her pants, sending her underwear down with them.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Baby, my love, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, instead crossing her arms over her front to remove her sweater, then behind her back to remove her bra. She let everything fall about her feet and then reached for the thing she’d removed from the drawers.</p><p>In the soft light of the room, Rio looked at Agatha’s naked body for the first time in weeks. It hadn’t changed. It looked the same, cut from marble, carved by talented, benevolent hands. Rio yearned to touch her, to run her tongue over every inch of her and could think only of how her skin tasted, how it changed from cool to warm to blazing hot the longer she worshipped it.</p><p>The only thing that could possibly draw Rio from her fantasy was the sight of Agatha leaning over to step into a harness. Strips of black across pale white.</p><p>“No. I-… let me, let me fuck you. Let me-…”</p><p>“I’ve told you already,” Agatha said sternly, her back still turned as she adjusted the straps, “I’m taking care of you until you can take care of yourself.”</p><p>“<em>Mi vida</em>.”</p><p>“The thing is,” Agatha said calmly, interrupting Rio’s next pleas, “I am so desperate for you. So plagued by visions of you fucking me, that it’s cruel to not look after yourself. Because it’s leaving me needy and empty.”</p><p>Rio was frowning now, the words on the tip of her tongue to argue back. But Agatha was reaching for what looked like a bottle of lube, administering it to whatever was between her thighs. When she was ready, she turned and Rio looked down to see a green silicone cock secured to her hips. It was new, at least, Rio didn’t recognise it, and all arguments died before they left her lips.</p><p>“I bought this for you. Your favourite colour. Big enough that I would feel you the next day if you used it right.”</p><p>Agatha was walking back to her now, climbing up to straddle her thighs. Rio swallowed and dragged her eyes away from the strap to look up at Agatha.</p><p>“I wanted you to put me through the mattress.”</p><p>Rio gulped, her hands gripping Agatha’s hips, “Then… let me?”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows but clearly wasn’t in the mood to argue so she gave one sharp push to Rio’s sternum and Rio obligingly fell onto her back.</p><p>And to her horror, Agatha, once stern and unyielding, was now pouting. Deliberately, brattily. She began pawing at her stomach, dragging her nails up and down her bruised skin as her lower lip jutted out.</p><p>Rio gaped at her, unable to find the words as Agatha sighed heavily and shifted up to reach down between them, her pout still in play.</p><p>“I really, really,” Rio gasped as Agatha pressed inside of her with two fingers, “really wanted you to be tearing me in two right now.”</p><p><em>What the fuck what the fuck</em>.</p><p>“But I’ll settle for fucking you instead, until you’re feeling up to it.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio managed to whine, her hips rocking desperately with every thrust of Agatha’s fingers. “Please. Please let me… <em>please</em>.”</p><p>“When you’re back to your full strength, when you’re feeling healthy, when you’re ready, I’m all yours. It’s motivation for you, my love.” And there was that damn pout again that Rio wanted to sink her teeth into.</p><p>“Don’t you want to fuck me?”</p><p>Rio felt insane. Insane for not being allowed to do what she wanted, insane for the way she already felt close to coming again, insane for the way Agatha was looking down at her with her fucking pout.</p><p>Insane that she couldn’t overpower the woman above her. Not now, not with the heaviness in her limbs or the constant short-circuiting of her brain.</p><p>“My love,” she gasped out when Agatha began to scissor her fingers inside her, at the same time now jerking the strap off, making Rio look down at it, making her salivate again.</p><p>“P-please.”</p><p>“Please, what?”</p><p>“Let me-…”</p><p>“No. Please, <em>what</em>?”</p><p>Rio gulped as Agatha spat down onto the thick length, as she rubbed the spit over it, as she pulled out from Rio without warning and dragged her soaked fingers up and down the strap. It was soaked now, more than lubed enough. But Rio had a flash of memory. A memory of a painful realisation weeks ago.</p><p>Agatha with the dripping lube in the palm of her hand. The lube she’d had to rub off over Rio’s stomach because she’d used too much. She’d been too concerned, too frightened she’d hurt Rio if she used any less than practically the whole bottle.</p><p>Agatha was angry now. She was making a point, making a claim. But she was still concerned. Still unaware that she could never hurt her. Not like this. Not the way that… her mind flashed again before she formed the name: <em>Ralph</em> had hurt Agatha.</p><p>She blinked, and looked back up again.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p><em>Agatha.</em></p><p>“I-…”</p><p>Agatha spat again and Rio lost all train of thought.</p><p>“Yes, my love?”</p><p>Rio’s mind was blank because Agatha was pouting down at her, fluttering her lashes as she continued to languidly jerk herself off, moving back to sit more over her thighs. “I can’t give you what you want if you don’t use your words. Mommy hasn’t got all day.”</p><p>That didn’t help.</p><p>Rio gaped and found breathing suddenly incredibly difficult as Agatha pressed the tip against her, letting her know it was there as she continued to stroke her spit and Rio’s wetness over it.</p><p>“A-Agatha,” she managed to choke out, but her mistake made Agatha stop, made her pout disappear.</p><p>“No,” she said, simply and firmly, and Rio inhaled a sharp breath as Agatha suddenly pressed into her. She’d not been ready for it, not at all expecting it yet. The lights that flashed suddenly blinded her.</p><p>She couldn’t see as she shook beneath Agatha, as she felt her hands find her hips and pull her limp body down as she thrust up. Her back arched and all she felt was how full she was, how her body was alive again.</p><p>“What did I tell you?”</p><p>Rio was trying to find the words, trying to make a noise that wasn’t just inane babbling as Agatha remained still inside of her.</p><p>“Rio? Can you breathe for me, baby? Can you say my name?”</p><p>Her brain was actually glitching. She couldn’t make it calm down, couldn’t make it think straight, so she only managed a sharp inhale of breath and did exactly as she’d just been asked: “A-Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha pulled entirely out of her then, making her feel one second of unbearable emptiness before she shoved the strap back in without warning.</p><p>“<em>No</em>.”</p><p>Rio gasped at the intrusion. She didn’t understand where she’d gone wrong or why her mouth couldn’t form the words: <em>mi vida, mi amor, mami, mommy.</em></p><p>Because Rio’s body was leading the charge, was quaking as Agatha started to slowly, <em>forcefully</em>, fuck her, she couldn’t get her mind to work again. She couldn’t form the words that were fumbling from her swollen lips in the form of broke gasps and moans.</p><p>Agatha’s gift was rearranging her insides, making her forget her trauma, her grief. She could only feel the stretch of it, the nails that dug into her hips. The hand that was levering her left leg up, opening her up more so Agatha could press further, deeper.</p><p>And then Agatha was moving her whole body, just as she’d moved her on the couch before.</p><p>She was a ragdoll, her legs were lifted up properly, wrapped around a pale waist, and her hips naturally shifted upwards, helped now by the hand that curled around her ass as Agatha hovered above her and stilled her own hips.</p><p>The room was silent except for their joined breathing, except for the subtle shift of Rio’s arms as they moved from where she’d been clutching the sheets to snake around Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>She gasped quietly when she was able to focus in on Agatha’s dark gaze and released a quiet whine as Agatha rolled her hips in a circular motion, testing her reaction.</p><p>“¿Estás bien, mi amor?” <em>Are you okay, my love?</em></p><p>Rio quivered and nodded just once, trying to pull Agatha flush against her body, though Agatha easily resisted.</p><p>“¿Quieres que me detenga?” <em>Do you want me to stop?</em><br/>
Round and round.</p><p>“N-no. No. No, my vida, I-… I…”</p><p>The circling stopped.</p><p>Agatha adjusted her weight and slowly gave in to Rio, allowing herself to be pulled down against her. She raised a hand to her cheek and her thumb came up and rubbed by the corner of her eye.</p><p>“You’re crying.”</p><p>Agatha’s tone was softer now, as if she’d come out of herself and was looking down at the two of them from an entirely different vantage point. But Rio hadn’t known she was crying until Agatha had pointed it out. Until her thumb had touched the tear she’d just shed.</p><p>“My love.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her hips shifting enough that Agatha glanced down and pulled out of her.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>It was the loudest noise Rio had made so far, shocked into shouting by the fear that Agatha was abandoning her, that she’d fall back into her brain again, that her body would simply wither without Agatha’s attentions.</p><p>“Hush,” Agatha cooed, her hand caressing Rio’s cheek before she dragged her thumb over her lower lip, letting Rio taste the salt of her own tears. Agatha soon replaced her thumb with her lips, cautiously, as if afraid Rio might turn from her.</p><p>She kissed her slowly, and let Rio take control this time. Rio was the one who parted Agatha’s lips with her tongue, who made Agatha moan with her hands buried deep in her hair, clutching at it, tugging for a response.</p><p>Rio didn’t know whether she was crying or not but Agatha was breaking the kiss now, Agatha was dropping down to her throat. Agatha was reaching between them, lining herself up again, and pressing back inside her.</p><p>It was slower this time, Agatha allowing her to adjust where before she’d just thrust her way in.</p><p>Rio arched up as she was filled once more, releasing a low moan as their hips became flush. Agatha paused, rolled her hips, bit down as she pressed up, pressed deeper.</p><p>Rio shook and garbled words that meant nothing and everything. Half Spanish, half nonsense.</p><p>Soon Agatha became frantic again. Soon she fucked her more desperately than before, her hips snapping back and forth as she fumbled for purchase against her clit.</p><p>It was messy, too frenetic for Agatha to be precise, to be deliberate, but the friction helped. The friction made Rio’s mind shutdown and her body scream.</p><p>Agatha was grunting with effort above her, as Rio lost her voice entirely and the moans became silent begs as she clutched and clawed at the woman above her. She was barely holding on, barely able to breathe when finally, mercifully she came.</p><p>She felt herself clench painfully around the strap and Agatha’s hips stuttered with her own where she felt the resistance. She changed her rhythm, instead of fucking hard and fast her movements became slower and deeper. She pressed in more, nudging Rio’s cervix as she quaked below her, gasping and scratching now until Agatha slowed to a halt, buried inside of her still.</p><p>The cold tip of her nose nudged Rio back to life as Agatha painted her cheek in pillowy kisses and murmured close to her ear, “All mine.”</p><p>Rio whimpered, beginning to feel uncomfortable now as she felt her heavy pulse between her legs and Agatha remained inside her. But she didn’t have to say anything as Agatha kissed her again and slowly pulled her hips back.</p><p>Panting, empty, and quaking, Agatha was quick about loosening her harness enough to slide it off without moving too far away from Rio. She allowed herself to be gathered in, to lay totally over her, and Rio relaxed with the soft weight of Agatha’s body pressing against her own.</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t still. She kept nuzzling into her cheek, kept kissing her there, kept running her fingers through her hair, kept her eyes open where Rio’s were closed.</p><p>It took a couple minutes but Rio came round soon enough and turned her face into the warmth of Agatha’s as she whispered, “I love you. I’ll do better. I’ll take care of myself.”</p><p>Agatha emitted a soft noise from the base of her throat and moved an inch or two to kiss Rio properly and murmur against her lips, “Let me help. I want to help.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched a little but she didn’t say anything and decided that just kissing for a while would be a better response. When she pulled away and Agatha only remained close she whispered: “It doesn’t hurt. With you. I mean, I…” Agatha shifted back to hover over her more and Rio tried to bring her back down but Agatha, again, resisted, “I feel better with you.”</p><p>Looking up at her now Agatha was far from the jealous woman who’d just marked her body and fucked her into the mattress. She was now her soft, what? Girlfriend? <em>Ex-girlfriend?</em> Lover? Affair partner?</p><p>Not knowing what to call Agatha even in her own mind made her quiver again and Agatha was already moving, already reaching across to tug the blankets over to throw around them.</p><p>“You’re cold.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You’re shaking. You were cold on the couch too.”</p><p>“I’m-…”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily but relaxed a little more when Agatha settled fully against her again. “It’s your turn now.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched and she smiled a little but she didn’t move. “We’ve already established that-…”</p><p>“My hands work,” Rio countered quickly, “and my tongue. Pick your poison, mi amor. But quickly because I <em>really</em> want to be inside you, however you’ll let me.”</p><p>Agatha captured her next breath against her lips and Rio sighed into it this time. She followed Agatha as she rolled them onto their sides and allowed her to guide her hand down between her thighs.</p><p>“Here,” she directed, as if Rio had forgotten exactly how Agatha liked to be touched. For the layman: it was always, and everywhere. But Rio knew to tease first, to watch as her dark eyes flashed, to not give her what she wanted until; “<em>Rio</em>.”</p><p>Rio smiled and teased Agatha’s entrance as Agatha rocked her hips downwards into her. “I’ll eat,” she said softly, “I’ll drink plenty of water, I’m sleep, I’ll not hide away, I’ll get fit and strong again.”</p><p>She pressed her index finger slowly inside Agatha, listening to her groan before she spoke again, “And then I’ll wear my gift, I’ll fuck you the way you want me to. The way you deserve to be fucked. For being, mi amor, for being so good for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s pout returned, subtle this time, unaffected, unplanned, and Rio smiled for it, smiled as she continued to fuck her slowly and leant forwards to capture her lower lip between her teeth. As Agatha cried out Rio entered her with a second finger, curling them inwards as her thumb sought out her swollen, needy clit.</p><p>“So good,” she repeated experimentally after releasing her lip. Agatha gasped for it, her nails digging into Rio’s arm and shoulder. Rio smiled as she increased the strength of her thrusts, wanting Agatha to know she would get there, that she’d get there <em>soon</em>.</p><p>That she would build herself back up and be strong enough to fuck Agatha exactly the way she wanted.</p><p>“My good girl,” she breathed, leaning in to capture Agatha’s still pouting lips in a kiss. Agatha began to moan into her mouth and came just as quickly as always.</p><p>But Rio, unlike Agatha before her, didn’t stop what she was doing. She kept inside of Agatha, kept fucking her slowly, letting her come down as she quivered about her, the walls of her pussy twitching their want around her fingers.</p><p>Rio smiled, aware of the dullish ache in her arm as she continued her slow movements. And when Rio pulled out of her, Agatha groaned and began to press soft kisses to her still swollen lips.</p><p>“Another,” she eventually said, smiling as Agatha tried to kiss her again, “tongue now. Face. Sit.”</p><p>“Lost your ability to speak again, my love?”</p><p>“Just desperate to start eating like you want me to.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and Rio grinned as she tangled their legs together. She felt warm again but couldn’t fight the shiver that took over her body as Agatha nuzzled in and stroked down her spine.</p><p>Her mind felt slow, as slow as her heart as it continued to strain against its cage.</p><p>“Rest. There’s time for that.”</p><p>“There is?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped, hidden behind fluttering eyelashes and Rio felt a distant throb in the back of her head as she hid from her.</p><p>“Forever, if you want it.”</p><p>Rio was silent for a beat, a breath, and then: “Agatha…,” <em>no</em> ‘Agatha’ wouldn’t do. ‘Agatha’ wasn’t what Agatha wanted. She wanted more than that, what only Rio could call her, what only made sense when it came from her own, adoring lips. “<em>Mi amor</em>, ¿esto significa que serás mi novia?” <em>Does this mean you’ll be my girlfriend?</em></p><p>Two beats, two breaths.</p><p>“Aren’t I a little old to be a girlfriend?”</p><p>“You’re a little married to be my wife.”</p><p>Agatha revealed herself then, a sea of blue, a soul laid bare in those eyes that met Rio’s and made Rio come alive in both body and mind. Her heart swelled in her chest as Agatha asked: “Are you proposing to me, Rio Vidal?”</p><p>“I’m saying forever is what I want.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, turning her head more into the sheets as she kept her gaze on Rio. She was silent for a while before: “Then move in with me? With us. Move in as soon as you get home. Sleep with me every night and wake with me every morning. I don’t want to be away from you. Not anymore.”</p><p>Rio winced as she leant up onto her arm and Agatha’s eyes flashed in a brief panic. But Rio was only adjusting herself so she could lean over Agatha, so she could brush the hair from her cheek and tilt her face up.</p><p>“What about the divorce? What about the press? Nicky? He’ll be confused. I can’t-…”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said quickly, “don’t say no. I… just take a key. Take a key and show up whenever you want. Show up all the time.” Rio watched her swallow, watched her hide again behind her eyelids, “But move in for the week. Stay with us. Just until Saturday. He’ll be served then. That’s when it’ll start. I think we’ll be good until Saturday, I can look after you until at least then, and then-…”</p><p>In Rio’s grief, in her reluctance to let Agatha around her more than necessary, she’d missed her stress. She’d missed the fear and panic that was just below the surface but so clear now in her pursed lips, her clutching fingers, <em>her inability to look at her girlfriend.</em></p><p>“I’ll be there,” Rio whispered as calmly as she could. “Through it all. And-…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed open again and she made Rio pause, made her frown as Agatha reached for her face.</p><p>“I kept you away because…” Rio sniffed and pulled back, quickly trying to get her words out before Agatha could speak again. But Agatha had already taken a hold of her face, had already kissed her lips.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter anymore, my love.” She reached up and kissed Rio again, pressing her nose into her warm cheek. “You’re here. I’m here. This is it. This is us, okay? Let me carry you through it. Let me carry you through it.”</p><p>Rio sighed and turned her face into the warmth of Agatha’s palm and rested there for a second before she said: “I just want you.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha started as Rio barely finished her sentence. Rio shifted and slowly lay back down and wrapped herself more closely around Agatha. “You have me. I-… Let’s focus on you. I know that,” she paused and shifted in Rio’s hold to get more comfortable, “I know that you’ll always be grieving your dad.”</p><p>The air felt like it had been sucked out of her lungs suddenly and her grip must have tightened so hard because Agatha made a soft noise against her. “I know, I know it’ll never go away. But I also want you to know that I will be here through it all and-…”</p><p>“What if I don’t get better? What if I’m just this miserable mess who can’t form a sentence or be strong enough for you? Agatha, I… What if it takes… I mean, I… I feel like I want to die.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t been prepared for the look Agatha gave her at her words. She looked panicked, heartbroken, devastated. And all these emotions were shining back at her in wide pools of blue, so fathomless Rio felt as if she could see right into Agatha’s soul. Agatha was silent for a few seconds and Rio wished she hadn’t said what she’d said.</p><p>Because dying would mean losing this. Would mean losing Agatha.</p><p>“I can’t pretend to… to know how badly this hurts, Rio. And I know you’ll be grieving your dad forever.” Agatha wiped a tear from her cheek before Rio even knew she was crying it. “You loved him. You loved him. And he loved you so completely.”</p><p>Rio sniffed and closed her eyes and found a rush of cold across her front as Agatha flipped them over and now hovered above her again. She kept her eyes closed as Agatha took her arms and heaved her into a sitting position. And just like that Agatha was wrapping herself around her again, holding her as close as physically possible.</p><p>“He’d want you to look after yourself,” she whispered as Rio began to cry real tears now, hiding them against Agatha’s neck. “And if it’s too hard, if it’s… if you can’t, then I’ll do it. For him. For you.”</p><p>Rio cried until the nails that latched onto Agatha’s back retracted and her clutches changed as she instead toyed with her long hair. She found comfort in the thing that had become a habit when they were in the Berkeley house, in the before times. Agatha just held her through it, held her until she felt her breathing even out, until Rio’s familiar hiccups were all that filled the room.</p><p>Rio had blurted the words out and with them came the throb again, the threat of pain and the stars that weren’t Agatha’s but Agony’s.</p><p>“I will love you through it all.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut, as if she couldn’t bear to be in a world where Agatha would have to accept her at her worst, at her weakest.</p><p>“I told you I could carry you. Carry you through it. Carry you-…”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said in a firmer voice than before, and Rio opened her eyes and raised her head up to see tears shining in a sea of sparkling blue. “I want you to be okay more than anything. But…”</p><p>Agatha was moving now, knocking Rio back onto her back and hovering over her. She took a breath, let her fingertips lightly graze the marks she’d left across her collarbone.</p><p>“But in the meantime, in the meantime, I will wait for you. I will give you the gift of time you gave me. I will be here with you, holding you through, <em>carrying</em> you through this. And in six months’ time, when the divorce is through, when we have a better idea of… of custody, I want to introduce you to the world as mine. In whatever form you come. Okay?”</p><p>Rio swallowed as she stared at the woman above her. Agatha had raised her gaze from her collarbone and was now looking at her with those same, swirling eyes. She looked nervous, nearing on shy.</p><p>So Rio lifted her heavy hand to cup her cheek as she said: “I have been so… I just didn’t think you’d want me like this.”</p><p>The sorrows of the last three weeks fell in the shape of a perfectly formed teardrop from Agatha’s sparkling eyes and hit her cheek as Agatha asked: “How could you think I wouldn’t want you?”</p><p>The question, as soft as it was, now sat heavily between them. Agatha was still for a moment and then she was gone from Rio’s sights.</p><p>She’d pulled back, her head in her hands. Rio didn’t follow her for a few seconds, instead she allowed the pain to strike, she saw the flashes that meant she’d be taken under any moment now.</p><p>Only when she heard Agatha really begin to cry did she force herself to push through, to open her eyes, to lean forward. To see what was before her instead of what was looming.</p><p>She reached for Agatha and in doing so made her whimper. Agatha just let her do it, just fell into her, her face still hidden behind her hands. Rio held on tight as she cried and forced her eyes to remain open, to keep out the threat of the lights, the pain, the memory of the betrayal.</p><p>Just as it was all beginning to creep in at the edges, Agatha was speaking again: “I made a mistake. A huge, fucking, horrendous mistake. And-…”</p><p>Rio adjusted her hold, loosening it so Agatha could shift and move her damp hands from her face to Rio’s instead.</p><p>“I would have been with you. The night you found out about Miguel. I’d have been curled up beside you. I could have come to see your mom, to help you a-arrange everything. I’d have held your hand and held you through it all. And I’ll never, <em>never</em> forgive myself that I couldn’t do that for you.”</p><p>Rio was shaking her head, releasing herself of Agatha’s hold as the lights glared their dark promise at her, “No, don’t. Stop. Don’t.”</p><p>“<em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>Rio released long, slow audible breaths and felt Agatha’s hands slip down to her chest. It was if she were guiding her breathing, encouraging it through her continued touch.</p><p>It took longer than was dignified but eventually she had strength enough to ask: “Do you ever think about him? Ever… miss him?”</p><p>“He was a good man, Rio. I think of him when I-…”</p><p>“No, not my dad. Ralph.”</p><p>Her eyes flashed open and above her she looked into Agatha’s stricken face, the panic and confusion she saw there.</p><p>“I-… <em>Rio</em>. <em>Please</em>, my love. I only think of you. I’m only, I’m only ever missing <em>you</em>. I-…”</p><p>Rio’s mind flashed, her eyes slowly closing again until darkness swallowed and yawned its welcome as she pressed her face in against the crook of Agatha’s neck. She felt Agatha cradle her head against her, felt the press of her nose into her hair, felt the comfort that came from being close.</p><p>Even when she was out of her mind with fear, with heartbreak, with grief. Proximity helped. Being close was salvation.</p><p>After a little while she whispered against Agatha’s warm skin, “I’m sorry. I know that. I know. I just…”</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay. I’ll tell you every second of every day if-…”</p><p>But Rio had ripped back, adamant and serious suddenly. “No, I don’t want that. I know, I know you don’t miss him. I do. I don’t want you to have to…” she trailed off, frowning up at Agatha for a second before she shifted her hips a little, pulling Agatha that much closer.</p><p>“I’m so scared of losing you.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her then, firm and reassuring. She pressed her whole face into Rio’s and wrapped her limbs tightly around her as if someone were trying to drag her away and Rio were her anchor.</p><p>Breathing out her words as they parted she promised: “I lost you and it was the worst day of my life. I’ll never let it happen again.”</p><p>Rio nodded, seeing the colour fade back into the room inch by inch. She kept her tight hold around Agatha and accepted the soft kisses with even softer ones of her own as her brain filtered back down to equilibrium. The panic she’d felt rising was quelled with each brush of Agatha’s lips, with every breath she felt her take against her chest.</p><p>Thoughts of Ralph took her to thoughts of Nicky. To his little face and his little frown. His big eyes and his big heart. Another flash, another sharp sting. She took in a shaking breath as she whispered:</p><p>“Agatha,” correcting herself a moment later as Agatha moved to kiss her cheek: “<em>Mi amor</em>, I want you to get security. For you and Nicky. I can’t be with you and it’s so bad as it is I-…”</p><p>Agatha pressed her nose in by her ear and murmured, “I’ve sorted it. I’ve hired someone, they’ll be there Saturday night after he’s served. TMZ will know the moment it happens, if not before, I’m sure. But we’ll be fine. We’ll be safe. I got us a new place, remember? In the hills, secluded, private. Some place you can stay with us. Some place you can live with us.”</p><p>Rio nodded, frowning as she thought of the crowds that had grabbed and reached for Agatha and Nicky like they were public property, like they belonged to them. Instead of Rio, they belonged to Rio.</p><p>With that thought in mind, with the soft reassurance of the word “girlfriend”, she whispered: “Two girlfriends and one little boy, hidden in the hills.”</p><p>“Exactly,” she felt Agatha smile against her cheek, her teeth making an appearance before she kissed her again and then moved to her lips to deliver the same treatment there.</p><p>“But first, stay with us a few days. Focus on getting better, and let me help. Let me be there. I’ll make dinner every night and you can sleep as much as you want.”</p><p>“On you?”</p><p>“On me.”</p><p>Rio felt her shoulders slump and Agatha’s hold around her loosen enough for her to lean back so she could look up at her properly, taking it all in for a second.</p><p>“You want this?”</p><p>Rio Vidal, sure as shit about everything in her life, needed to make sure Agatha Harkness was sure as shit about her. Or she’d never make it to old bones.</p><p>Agatha raised her hands to lift Rio’s chin and surveyed her for a breath’s worth before she said: “I’ve never been more sure about anything. Only Nicky. Only you. And one other thing…”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and watched a blush slowly creep its way up Agatha’s cheeks.</p><p>“I really don’t want to be your girlfriend for very long.”</p><p>“Wh-…?”</p><p>“So,” Agatha interrupted, now almost beetroot red, “When I’m divorced, when I have full custody, when we’re out and safe and happy, maybe you can do something… about that…”</p><p>Rio gulped, swallowing down her desire to blurt the words out right now. Instead she moved her hands, made them trail random patterns over Agatha’s back just to feel her, just to warm themselves against her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes settled a good couple inches further south than her own as she hid in plain sight, still wrapped tightly around her, sitting comfortably in her lap.</p><p>And she wanted her that way forever. Holding on tight, sitting proudly. Ideally, always naked. But she’d take clothed. She’d take her however she came. So long as she was close. So long as Rio could hold her.</p><p>So, feeling braver than she’d felt in weeks, she uttered a promise to Agatha, to the universe, to Miguel.</p><p>“When the divorce is through, when you have full custody, when you’re out, when we’re ready, as soon as we’re ready, I’m going to ask you to marry me.”</p><p>Agatha’s blush deepened somehow and Rio smiled because of it. The muscles in her face strained for a second, unused to such a sudden, bright grin after weeks of forced, tight ones. But they eased soon enough. And Rio’s hands felt strong again as they moved to hold Agatha at her sides, letting her feel the grip, the renewed strength.</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha said quietly, shifting a little in her lap, adjusting to Rio’s changed hold. “Maybe you can just ask now and I’ll say yes and-…”</p><p>Rio chuckled and Agatha began to scowl. How quickly she changed, how quickly she reacted. Rio’s hold tightened a little and she leant in to kiss the corner of Agatha’s jaw. “I want to do it properly. You deserve it to be romantic. Special.”</p><p>Agatha’s blush was creeping now down her neck, joining the soft flush that had already appeared across her chest from her earlier exertion. Rio ducked her head down to experience it, pressing a soft kiss there before Agatha forced her head back up. She was cradling her chin, her thumb drawing a line across her cheek.</p><p>Rio’s smile faded but the comfort she felt didn’t.</p><p>“I love you. Even if you’re going to make me wait.”</p><p>Rio’s smile came back, only brighter than before. Agatha didn’t return it.</p><p>She huffed a little and gently pushed Rio’s head back, still blushing.</p><p>“You’re making me wait to-…”</p><p>Apparently Agatha didn’t want to hear it because she’d slapped her hand across Rio’s mouth. Rio protested by licking her palm.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha huffed but Rio saw her lips twitch just a smidge. “You need to rest.” But she made the mistake of pulling her hand away and Rio immediately pulled Agatha down on top of her, only to attempt to roll them over.</p><p>But she’d overestimated the strength she had.</p><p>Agatha easily overpowered her and Rio groaned and then threw a brief tantrum by drumming her legs on the bed. Agatha laughed as she hovered on all fours above her. <em>She</em> was smiling now and <em>Rio</em> was scowling.</p><p>“What did I say about getting better first?”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio reached to hold Agatha’s forearms, opening her legs inch by inch to try and destabilise Agatha’s stance so she’d fall onto her.</p><p>Unfortunately Agatha had more brain cells than Rio had accounted for. But she moved to lie on top of her, placing most of her weight on her forearms by Rio’s head. Rio huffed dramatically but as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist she began to feel strangely calm again.</p><p>Her whole body relaxed as Agatha’s warmth made her warm and her eyelashes fluttered a little.</p><p>“Baby?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>Agatha brushed her hair back from her forehead and whispered: “How’re you feeling?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Just fine?”</p><p>“Happy.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, brushing her fingers along Rio’s cheekbone as her eyes fluttered their last and closed. “You should go to the bathroom, Rio.”</p><p>“I’m tired. Maybe a little sore. I just want to lie here.”</p><p>It was peaceful, for two minutes. Rio lay with her girlfriend above her. She was warm and comfortable and confident that everything would be okay.</p><p>“My love,” Agatha insisted right when she felt like Rio was about to fall asleep. “Are you still with me?”</p><p>“Mm. Comfy.”</p><p>“I thought you were sore?”</p><p>“Mm. Yeah, a little.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and Rio shuffled slightly beneath her, just burrowing more in to the mattress. But then, it happened.</p><p>Rio gasped as Agatha rolled them over and she reached between her thighs. “Sore? Here?”</p><p>Rio huffed as she rocked her hips and Agatha just grinned, “Why so sore?”</p><p>“You’re so cruel.”</p><p>“I was taking care of you the way I want you to take care of me.” She was pouting again, and Rio bit down on her own lip as Agatha began to scissor her fingers either side of her swollen clit. “Only I don’t want to be sore. I’m aiming for back breaking, okay?”</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha.”</p><p>“Uh! We gotta work on your memory, baby.”</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio groaned quietly, stopping Agatha by grasping her wrist. “Riding me wouldn’t require any energy I-…”</p><p>“Are you listening to me?”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand away in one swift movement and it took barely a nudge to get a now pliant Rio onto her back. Agatha resumed to her position above her and rested her forearms either side of Rio’s head. Rio groaned. “All I’m asking is that my girlfriend breaks my back. I’ve lived almost forty years and I’ve never been fucked properly and-…”</p><p>“Hey I’ve fucked you properly that isn’t-…”</p><p>The look on Agatha’s face told her everything she needed to know about the little game she was playing and Rio scowled because of it. Her mind was catching up now, her body whirring beneath Agatha’s.</p><p>“You’re goading me.”</p><p>“So smart,” Agatha grinned, leaning in to kiss the tip of Rio’s nose. “See it’s a win-win. <em>You</em> get better by eating well and generally looking after yourself and then you get to-…”</p><p>“<em>Mi vida</em>,” Rio insisted, still frowning even as Agatha now leant up to kiss the furrow between her brows. Her indignant fire had burnt bright for all of a minute but now it was slowly dying as reality settled close.</p><p>“Fine,” she agreed, not happy about it but too tired to fight a battle she’d surely lose. “But you can’t tease me anymore.”</p><p>“But teasing will make you better sooner.”</p><p>Rio huffed and then barked a throaty laugh as Agatha attacked her sides and buried her face against her neck. She knew why she was doing it. Why she’d let Rio relax for a while before making her squirm beneath her.</p><p>She was checking in on her, making sure she wasn’t just sinking into herself again. She was keeping her buoyant.</p><p>Agatha was carrying her.</p><p>As Agatha relented, Rio breathed without having to force herself, she breathed in the calm that came from being held by Agatha, by being kissed all over her face by Agatha. And calm turned to peace as Agatha whispered a soft “stay here” and she left her in the cocoon she’d made of blankets for them only to return with a warm, damp cloth and a towel.</p><p>Agatha first cleaned her face with the cloth, being as gentle as she could. She wiped down her body, easing over the marks she’d made until she reached between her thighs and tended to her ache.</p><p>Rio remained still, kept her eyes on Agatha as she cared for and cleaned her. Replacing the damp cloth with the towel she repeated her ministrations and finished it off with a kiss.</p><p>“Use the bathroom, my love. Then come back to bed. I’ll get some water and-…”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Agatha looked surprised for a second at the interruption, and then her face melted down to a soft smile.</p><p>“I love you too. But I mean it: bathroom, then bed.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and remained still until Agatha was already at the door grabbing her robe from the hook. She turned to check Rio was doing as she was told and smiled when she saw that she was.</p><p>Rio felt heavy, like her body was made of cement. But she made it to the bathroom as Agatha stopped her by the door for a brief kiss. She then disappeared out the bedroom and Rio went to pee, went to wash her face, do a cursory brush of her teeth, and then flop back down into bed.</p><p>By the time Agatha returned with two large glasses of water and a packet of Tylenol, Rio was already buried down in the middle of the bed.</p><p>“Are you naked under there?”</p><p>“Come join me and find out.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she placed everything down on the side and slipped a hand beneath her pillow to pull out a set of pyjamas.</p><p>“Top or bottom?”</p><p>Rio smirked and pulled the blankets up to hide it but was too slow for Agatha not to see. “What?”</p><p>“I have so much to teach you.”</p><p>“What? I-… oh. Shut up.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk became a grin that she no longer hid as she reached out to make grabby hands at Agatha, “Come here, please.”</p><p>“No you’re making fun.”</p><p>“Okay, okay, but I’m excited to teach you. You’re <em>clearly</em> a fast learner and-…”</p><p>Agatha huffed and threw the pyjamas on the bed. “You take the shirt I’ll-…”</p><p>“Thought so.”</p><p>Agatha scowled as she loosened her robe, “I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Come here to me. Please.” Rio didn’t bother to reach for the shirt and instead just opened the covers and when Agatha was wearing her pyjama pants she then slipped in.</p><p>Agatha made a disgruntled noise but Rio was already on her, around her, all over her. She’d managed to shuffle down as she’d moved closer so her head was no longer on the pillow and instead against the mattress. It was better like this, it granted more access.</p><p>Only as her mouth opened to press a slow kiss to the mound of Agatha’s breast she made a noise of protest at the sudden tug at her hair and tilted her head up to look. “You’re supposed to be resting.”</p><p>Rio huffed quietly, too tired to argue so instead just mumbling, “Why aren’t you naked?”</p><p>“You’re still cold. Put on your shirt.”</p><p>Rio huffed quietly and pressed her face back in against Agatha’s chest, breathing in the scent of her skin, allowing the warmth to rouge her cheeks. “I missed you,” her words came out in a garbled mumble with how close she was pressing but there was no need to repeat them.</p><p>“I missed you too.”</p><p>Agatha finally settled more around her and didn’t even protest when Rio began to slowly slide her pants down, the soft fabric and elastic waist making it easy even with Agatha laying on her side. She took advantage of the proximity to graze over Agatha’s ass as she worked the fabric down and with Agatha’s reluctant shuffling she managed to kick them off her.</p><p>When Agatha was fully naked again Rio breathed out, lifting her leg so Agatha engulfed her. She squeezed her ass, holding her there because she hadn’t been able to in so long.</p><p>She’d slept with Agatha in the time they’d been apart. But not like this. Not with their naked bodies pressed so fiercely together. And Rio <em>had</em> missed it. She’d missed the feel of Agatha, the scent of her, every curve and line of her body.</p><p>“I stole your shirt back from Costume,” Agatha breathed out against her hair, “To sleep with. In case you didn’t stay. It doesn’t smell like you anymore. Will you wear it again. Please?”</p><p>Rio answered with a kiss, slowly tilting her head up, “Now?”</p><p>“No, just… before we’re apart again.”</p><p>Rio nodded, watched as Agatha watched her, completely unabashed, unembarrassed by her request. “Of course.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched towards a smile and Rio dipped her head back down again, pressing back close.</p><p>There was silence in the room apart from Rio’s occasional movement to kiss or nudge into Agatha. She felt her body warm slowly, matching Agatha’s temperature and then beginning to exceed it.</p><p>She knew when she was truly warm because Agatha sighed happily, stroking over her back to seek more of it.</p><p>“I called Alice earlier,” she admitted quietly, “I was worried about you. She’s booked you an appointment with my doctor for Monday afternoon.”</p><p>“You called Alice?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I-… You don’t like Alice.”</p><p>“No, but I love you. Alice loves you. I wanted to make sure that she was looking after you right.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly and Agatha shifted in tandem.</p><p>“When we were watching the movie?”</p><p>“Mmhm. I also got the guy fired who didn’t show up for us.”</p><p>Rio nodded a little where she was pressed back into Agatha’s chest, her fingers lifting to absently toy with the ends of her hair again. “I hate it. When people grab at you. At Nicky. I feel so… so out of control and…”</p><p>Agatha lifted her head up, pulled back so she could look down at her properly, “And I feel safe when you’re with us. I <em>only</em> feel safe when you’re with us. When I took Nicky away I wasn’t thinking straight and then I turned… but you were already there and…”</p><p>Rio moved up to lay her head on the pillow beside Agatha and smiled sadly, “I know why you left. It’s okay.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha whispered quickly, “It’s not. <em>She’s</em> not okay. She’s… I meant what I said,” Agatha’s face had hardened and Rio held her breath. “I don’t want you to see her again.”</p><p>Rio nodded, watched the hard lines of Agatha’s face, the setting of her jaw. “She’s my friend, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed and was in the process of turning away when Rio reached for her face to keep her where she was. Agatha’s cheek felt cool again and Rio wondered whether her hand was now warm or Agatha was just that cold.</p><p>“Mi amor, I need to talk to her about it. I’ve told her before I’m not interested. She knows I’m-…”</p><p>“She likes you,” Agatha deadpanned, “She’s in love with you?”</p><p>“No. Nothing like that.”</p><p>“So she did it to try and force something? To try and-…”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, shifting to raise up slightly.</p><p>“Don’t call me that.”</p><p>“<em>My love</em>,” Rio insisted, “What could she do? The camera-…?”</p><p>“No, no, I couldn’t-…” Agatha growled and snapped her hands up to hide her face, “She did what was mine to do! She took without asking! She forced you to kiss her when-…!”</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio urged, her heart rate picking up rapidly, “Baby, please. It was barely a kiss. It was-…”</p><p>“You’re missing the point. You’re missing the point.”</p><p>Agatha was gone then, torn from her clutches and out the bed. What had been, for a while, a peaceful cocoon was now an empty one, with Rio left alone in the centre of it all.</p><p>Agatha was pacing.</p><p>“Baby.”</p><p>“I can’t let you near her. Not now. Not when I know she’ll do it again.”</p><p>Rio took a slow breath in as Agatha paced up and down, turning every four steps. Her traitorous heart was gnawing against its cage to get to the other woman, but she had to hold on, had to keep her mind steady.</p><p>“She won’t. I promise she won’t. Not if I tell her I have a girlfriend. I won’t out you. I just-…”</p><p>“Tell her you have someone who will rip her rust bucket fucking hair from her fucking head if she-…”</p><p>But Agatha had stopped because Rio was smiling. She hadn’t meant to. It had just happened. The relief. The sudden, joyous, uplifting relief of having Agatha Harkness, so soft and so gentle, now losing it again. For her.</p><p>“<em>Don’t</em>. I swear Rio, I will-…”</p><p>She’d been so fearful, hiding herself away. And now…</p><p>“Mi amor, te adoro.” <em>My love, I adore you.</em></p><p>Agatha stopped moving all together, her brow knitted so tightly, her limbs all tense. And Rio just raised to kneel up in the middle of the bed, still grinning, calm now where Agatha was all fury still.</p><p>“Come back.”</p><p>Agatha remained still, her brow relaxing just a little but she hadn’t moved. “You’re not taking me seriously.”</p><p>“I think you’re deathly serious.”</p><p>“Then agree you won’t see her again. Tell me. Promise me.”</p><p>“I can’t do that, baby.”</p><p>Agatha threw her hands up and began to pace once more as Rio shuffled to the edge of the bed and held her heavy arms out to Agatha.</p><p>“She took advantage! She <em>assaulted</em> you!”</p><p>Rio’s smile began to fade again as she realised Agatha’s fury wouldn’t. She dropped her arms, leant back against her ankles. “Come with me,” she said quietly, “the next time I see her. We can talk to her together. Tell her <em>we’re</em> together. And if, if you don’t like what she has to say, I won’t hold you back if you want to rip her hair out.”</p><p>“You’re making fun. This isn’t funny.”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Rio said as calmly as she could. “I’ll hold her down too.”</p><p>Agatha was shaking her head, but in her body Rio saw a relaxing, a slowing down, a steadying.</p><p>She stopped. Rio held her breath.</p><p>“I trust you,” she eventually said, her body angled towards her but her head angled down, “I trust you. But you… you never once pushed her away. I know you’re struggling and I know… I know we weren’t… I had no claim on you but…”</p><p>Rio moved then, wincing at the strain that had been on her ankles. She climbed down from the bed and crossed the short distance to delicately hold Agatha’s hips, ducking her head down to see her face.</p><p>“You’ve had a claim on me since the moment I saw you.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly as she stepped in, as Agatha moved to hold her arms.</p><p>“I trust Wanda. She’s always been a good friend, with a good heart.” Agatha scoffed but Rio ignored it as she said: “I’ll be different with her. You’ll never have to…” She paused, thought about her next words carefully, “If you’ll let me, I’ll tell her we’re together. Nothing like today will ever happen again. She’ll keep our secret. And then one other person will know I’m yours.”</p><p>Agatha raised her head a little and Rio took the opening, using it to kiss her. Her arms snaked around Agatha’s waist as Agatha held her about her shoulders. The kiss was heated, heavy, as if Agatha wanted Rio to suffocate for it, to be pushed to the brink until she allowed her the gift of breath again.</p><p>She walked Agatha back into the wall, captured her surprise inside her mouth, but pressed into her still. She was seeing spots as she continued to kiss her, desperate to force a moan from Agatha before she was released.</p><p>Her thigh raised between Agatha’s legs and the moan escaped her, and Rio was able to breathe finally as she pulled back and remained close, applying pressure to make Agatha whimper. Agatha was holding her head, kissing her with every heavy breath. And Rio dropped her leg, not because she wanted to, but because her body wasn’t up to it.</p><p>She panted softly as Agatha traced her lips with her tongue and whispered after she’d done: “What I said earlier about access to you? I want it at all times. Not just in my bedroom. Around my house, in my trailer, I want you available for me to feel you. Promise me. Promise me you’ll-…”</p><p>“Anytime, anywhere. My body needs yours to survive.”</p><p>Agatha nodded but barely moved her head, only keeping her gaze steady on Rio’s face to search for the lie that wasn’t there.</p><p>And Rio was pulling back, walking backwards with Agatha until her legs hit the bed and she turned to climb onto it and pull Agatha with her. Agatha joined her, curled into her under the sheets, and Rio resumed her earlier toying with the ends of her hair.</p><p>“I will kill her,” Agatha murmured after a while of just gazing into Rio’s eyes. It made Rio smile, made her grin.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha huffed quietly, running her fingers up and down Rio’s back.</p><p>“You’re warmer now.”</p><p>“See? I need you.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched but she sighed out: “Go to sleep, Rio.”</p><p>“You sleep too. We have a big bike ride ahead of us tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha smiled this time, nuzzling in to steal a soft kiss, though Rio could feel the earlier tension still in Agatha’s tight shoulders. “You know he’s been bragging about his new friend at school?”</p><p>“He has?”</p><p>“Mmhm. His nanny told me all the other boys keep looking <em>very</em> disappointed every time she shows up to pick him up.”</p><p>Rio laughed and raised her brows, “Quite the reputation to have. Popular amongst little kids.”</p><p>“Mm. It’s actually very sexy.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, her fingers now moving to brush down Rio’s nose in a move Rio knew was to try and get her to sleep. Agatha felt a little looser now, a little more calm as Nicky became the topic, rather than Wanda.</p><p>“You like that I’m good with Nicky?”</p><p>“Obviously. Now stop talking.”</p><p>“No, I like talking to you. Especially about how sexy I am.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and pulled her hand away to drape around her again. “I can withhold any and all sex from you if you don’t start behaving. What happened to looking after yourself?”</p><p>Rio’s pleased grin morphed into a scowl but she closed her eyes immediately, if only to show that she did not want sex to be taken away. No matter how much she currently wanted to talk instead of sleep.</p><p>She felt Agatha sigh happily against her though, felt her duck in to kiss her. In her kiss Rio felt renewed warmth, a renewed peace. Agatha’s fury had sparked her brain back to life, it lit the dark crevices that had been screaming at her words of garbled threat, sounds of impending doom.</p><p>They still had to talk. They still had to discuss Wanda and Ralph and Nicky. They had to talk about where they were going to live, how they would see each other, how they’d get through this. But for now, for now Rio relaxed into her girlfriend. For now they’d promised each other forever. For now, that was enough.</p><p>The press of Agatha against her acted as a safety blanket, that lifeline she’d needed to keep going, keep breathing. Her body, used to pain, used to suffering, now recognised Agatha’s embrace. It now relaxed. It now calmed, was soothed, was hers again.</p><p>The lights were all gone now, dissolved into a golden hue behind her eyelids as Agatha’s kiss lingered for a few seconds before she pulled back to murmur against her lips, “I love you. My answer is yes.”</p>

<p>Rio fell asleep that night warmer than she’d been in weeks. Partly because Agatha had ensured that she was properly covered, properly tucked in, and partly because every limb was entangled with every one of Agatha’s limbs.</p><p>At least when she was first drifting off.</p><p>When she woke up the limbs on her left side were sprawled across the bed. On her other side Agatha was curled close, her head on her chest, her fingers drawing soft patterns against her hip.</p><p>Agatha knew she was awake before Rio did.</p><p>“Buen día, my amor.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she raised a heavy hand to rub at her eyes, “Mm’morning.”</p><p>“Did you sleep okay?” Agatha lifted up slowly, nudging the bridge of her nose against Rio’s jaw as she yawned above her.</p><p>“Amazingly. Did you sleep?”</p><p>“A little.”</p><p>Rio hummed as Agatha moved further up and pressed her face briefly in against her cheek, “I need to get up and make breakfast. I want us to have an easy day, a… just a normal day. But, when you come home tonight, can we talk? Discuss… discuss everything?”</p><p>In Agatha’s voice Rio heard only hesitance, only fear. And as her brain kicked into gear from its sleepy haze she put two and two together and realised why Agatha had only slept ‘a little’.</p><p>Fear sparked through her body as she uttered, “Have you changed your mind?”</p><p>“No, my love. No.”</p><p>Agatha was above her now, her face open and full of concern. “No. Never. There’s just…” she sighed heavily and Rio felt the fear die as she did only to be replaced with worry. “There’s a lot to think about. I want us to be as solid and as on the same page as we can be.”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly and grasped the wrist that Agatha had raised to hold her cheek. Rio forced a small smile and Agatha returned it, “I started therapy, you know. Two sessions. Intense. Uncomfortable. Hideous, actually.”</p><p>A subject change. Agatha’s brain must have been actively bouncing about from topic to topic all night. Rio felt a pang in her chest. Agatha only slept well with her and if she couldn’t even provide rest anymore then… she swallowed down that thought. It was too painful to consider. Too treacherous a path to go down when she already felt so useless, unable to be who Agatha needed to be.</p><p>She thought instead of how Agatha’s brain worked differently to hers. At least now. Rio’s, in her grief, was slow and murky, like the depths of a fathomless lake.</p><p>Agatha’s was the raging sea of her blue eyes. It stormed and raced to the shore but retreated once it had its fill of sandy sanctuary, only to rage again and retreat again. Over and over.</p><p>Agatha was ever churning, her mind wild with activity.</p><p>She shuffled up the bed to sit up and Agatha ducked her head down where she had access once more to kiss her chest, unknowingly nuzzling where it hurt most.</p><p>“You have?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“And? How’s it…? How’s it going?”</p><p>Rio’s brain was slow to tick over but it was tumbling complicated notions, confused thoughts. Was Agatha telling her this to explain why she might <em>not</em> want to be her girlfriend? Was she using it to distract her from something?</p><p>Was this the tip of the iceberg?</p><p>Agatha sighed against her collarbone, ducking down further to nuzzle just above her left breast, her left hand coming up to curl around her ribs on her right side. “Fine.”</p><p>“Just fine?”</p><p>Rio lost her grip on her thoughts when Agatha began to kiss her way down and gasped when her mouth opened to envelop her nipple, sucking gently before releasing it with a smirk.”Fine.”</p><p>Rio grunted. “You can’t just do that.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha was grinning now, her chin resting in the valley of her breasts after having moved her body totally on top of Rio’s. “You don’t like it?”</p><p>She pouted.</p><p>Rio scowled.</p><p>“You’re going to kill me.”</p><p>“No, I’m going to make sure you’re strong and healthy.”</p><p>Rio scowled still and kicked the blankets a little to be able to cross her legs over Agatha’s as she lay between her thighs. “Are you going to withhold sex?”</p><p>Agatha hummed, turning her head down to kiss Rio’s chest and let her feel the vibrations of it against her sternum. “Well I’m not saying I want to…”</p><p>Rio flopped her legs back down and hit the mattress with her fists. The only thing she achieved was making Agatha smirk up at her again.</p><p>“If I tease you a little <em>whilst</em> withholding, you’ll know I’m serious about you getting better.”</p><p>“I much preferred talking about your therapy.”</p><p>“Well I didn’t.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and Agatha began to move slowly back up her body until she was supporting herself with her hands either side of her head. “We can discuss it tonight. I’ve been told I need to pick a person to talk to about it anyway and well…”</p><p>There it was. Agatha hadn't been hiding anything at all.</p><p>She’d been <em>asking</em>.</p><p>Rio felt her whole self relax as she stared up at Agatha’s shy gaze, no, stared up at her <em>girlfriend’s</em> shy gaze.</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched in spite of her ire and she reached to tuck Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Okay. Just lie with me a little while longer?”</p><p>“Ten minutes.”</p><p>“Ten minutes.”</p><p>And Rio’s smile returned as Agatha settled down properly against her, pressing into the crook of her neck. Agatha’s earlier patterns against her hip continued now over her shoulder. Her fingertips snaked their softness. Her skin absorbed it, hungry for more of it, for Agatha’s touch here, there, everywhere.</p><p>And in turn, Rio traced her fingers up and down Agatha’s back, enjoying her subtle movements every time she hit the sensitive spot over her waist.</p><p>She did a check in with her body as she focused on Agatha’s touch. Her legs were splayed open, enough for Agatha to be comfortable between them. She was lying down so it was hard to tell but they didn’t feel as heavy as usual. She could feel the pangs of hunger beginning to make an appearance in her stomach, which could only be a good thing,</p><p>And then there was her chest. It was warm, because Agatha was laid across it, because she was physically there, just lying over her, drawing soft patterns against her shoulder.</p><p>“If you want to stay in bed,” Agatha said after a few minutes of silence, “Nicky would understand. I would understand.”</p><p>Rio sighed, stretching her arms up and back, fishing beneath the pillows to source her shirt. Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>“I can’t stay in bed. We have a bike ride and I have your shirt to wear, remember?” Rio found it with her left hand and ripped it out with a flourish that made Agatha gasp and sit up suddenly.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>She flushed instantly, and flopped back down against Rio as Rio laughed. “Protective of my shirt now?”</p><p>“It’s important for the movie.”</p><p>Rio hummed as she draped it over the blankets that covered them both.</p><p>“I can’t believe you still sleep with this.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a soft breath against Rio’s neck as Rio fingered the delicate fabric of her favourite shirt now laid above the sheets, providing the thinnest, most useless additional barrier against the cool of the morning.</p><p>“I can’t believe you own a pink cowboy shirt.”</p><p>Rio laughed, idly tracing her thumb along the line of one of the little cowboys, “Well maybe a sand colour would have been cooler.”</p><p>“Definitely.”</p><p>“But cowboys make everything cool.”</p><p>“Couldn’t have been flowers,” Agatha grumbled, her voice thick with sleep, though Rio knew she’d barely had any. “Or literally anything else. Pink just adds insult to injury.”</p><p>“You’re the one who stole it.”</p><p>“In spite of the colour, in spite of the cowboys.”</p><p>Rio hummed with a smile on her face as the little man scowled back at her from the lapel.</p><p>“What colour is it anyway?” Agatha was yawning now, nuzzling in closer, “Bashful? Blush?”</p><p>“The colour of your cheeks when I’m inside of you.”</p><p>Rio yelped out a laugh as Agatha bit down on the sensitive spot in the crook of her neck. “Careful. You won’t be seeing that colour again for a while.”</p><p>“Then looking at our favourite shirt will have to do.”</p><p>Agatha huffed again and flicked her tongue out against the spot she’d just sank her teeth into and as she sat up she whispered, “You can’t come down with a neck like that.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and as Agatha slipped onto her side next to her she held the blankets up, inviting a rush of cold air across her body. There, like badges of honour, was the evidence of Agatha’s jealousy.</p><p>“Mi amor,” Rio whispered reverently, reaching down to a mark on her stomach just as Agatha did too. Their fingers met, entwined, and Agatha leant back in to kiss her once, a barely there, habitual kiss.</p><p>“Take a shower, take as long as you need. I’ll sort Nicky out and we’ll see you for breakfast soon?”</p><p>Rio nodded mutely, now watching Agatha as she lingered where she was. She seemed reluctant to leave so Rio didn’t say anything that may unintentionally hasten her departure.</p><p>“Thank you for coming back for us,” Agatha breathed out after a few seconds of them both too afraid to break the silence. “In the arena. Thank you for loving Nicky.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, “Mi amor, I don’t-…”</p><p>Agatha had captured her refusal to accept the thanks against her lips, and Rio hadn’t had a chance to breathe, had lost her breath in the kiss. She was able to breathe again only when Agatha allowed it. She nuzzled in, leaning her body more over Rio’s again, for warmth or comfort or both.</p><p>“I love you for loving him. I love that he feels safe with you and that he misses you when you’re not there. I need you to know that. I need you to know.”</p><p>“My love,” Rio breathed just before Agatha kissed her again. She wrapped her arms around Agatha again and pulled her fully over her once more, unable right now to speak. When Agatha allowed her breathe once more she whispered, “I love your son because he’s yours and because he’s the sweetest, best kid in the world.”</p><p>Agatha kissed the corner of her lips, her responsibilities apparently forgotten now she was back over Rio.</p><p>“I told you before, he’s a bonus.”</p><p>Agatha was nuzzling again, moving to press her face in against Rio’s cheek, by her ear, then down her jaw and against her neck. Rio hummed her delight at the attentions, trying to remember the last time she’d had them.</p><p>But that was then, and there was only now.</p><p>Agatha was retracing her steps from the night before, making her way down her body and kissing over each jealous mark she’d made. Rio stretched out beneath her, feeling warmer again, despite the covers now slipping inch by inch.</p><p>“Baby, don’t you need to be somewhere?”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha mumbled something and sounded a lot like, “right here.”</p><p>And the right here in question was between Rio’s thighs. It made Rio laugh initially, when Agatha began to kiss the sensitive skin along her inner right thigh but she soon gasped as Agatha sank her teeth into her flesh and she reached to push her head up.</p><p>“Agatha. Don’t tease it’s not fair.”</p><p>“Who said I was teasing?”</p><p>Rio huffed and rose up onto her elbows to scowl down at Agatha who had paused what she was doing and was now grinning up at Rio, her eyes wicked.</p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p>“Don’t what?”</p><p>“Tease.”</p><p>Agatha’s grin grew up her face and she settled down more between Rio’s legs. Rio gasped as she lifted her thighs and wrapped her arms around them. It was so smooth, so second-nature, that before Rio could even blink, Agatha’s tongue was against her, and her breath was taken.</p><p>She collapsed back, her back already lifting off the bed, her fingers already grasping at Agatha’s sex-wild hair.</p><p>“Wh-…? I…”</p><p>“A reward,” Agatha said, her tongue swirling slowly around her clit before she continued, “for sleeping so soundly, for already taking care of yourself.”</p><p>“Jesus fuck, jesus fuck.”</p><p>“Jesus isn’t here, honey. It’s just mommy.”</p><p>Rio choked on a gasp as Agatha returned her attention to her pussy. She was aching and sensitive still from last night but Agatha either didn’t know or didn’t care. She used her fingers and her tongue like the born eater she was.</p><p>Rio came with a lurch before she even knew she was close. But Agatha didn’t pull away. She instead rolled her tongue, lapping up everything she could, making Rio shiver at the sensitivity, making her whine for the teasing.</p><p>When Agatha did eventually pull back, pull out, she raised her pointer and middle fingers in full view of Rio and crawled up her until she was over her hips. Instead of offering them for Rio to clean she reached between her own thighs and sunk down slowly onto them, making Rio salivate as she watched.</p><p>“Let me, let me,” she began to beg, struggling to sit up to get closer, to try and help.</p><p>Agatha just smiled, just kept fucking herself, kept her free hand on Rio’s shoulder to hold her down.</p><p>“You haven’t earned it yet.”</p><p>“No no no,” Rio whined, as Agatha bit her lower lip to hold in her loud moans.</p><p>“Tell me,” Agatha breathed when she had her moaning more under control, her chest now heaving with every breath. “What you’d do to me when you’re stronger.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her hands now allowed to hold Agatha’s hips as she stared down between them. It was torture but the slow rhythm, the soft noises, it all allowed Rio to fantasise about things she’d not been able to fantasise about for weeks.</p><p>“I’d take you from behind,” her voice felt jagged in her throat, all her energy was being spent elsewhere.</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>“Up against a wall.”</p><p>Her fingers tightened on Agatha’s hips. Agatha whined.</p><p>“I’d fuck you full of my strap.”</p><p>Agatha released a louder moan than before, her hips stuttered, lost their rhythm.</p><p>Rio was digging her nails in now.</p><p>“I’d fuck your ass.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth hung open, her noises guttural, breathy, unashamed.</p><p>“Make you choke on my fingers so you know who you belong to.”</p><p>Agatha came then, collapsing forwards with the force of her orgasm. She managed to catch herself before she broke Rio’s nose but she quaked above her and Rio caught her. She wrapped her arms around her and opened her mouth for the fingers that mercifully moved to enter it.</p><p>A moan escaped her as she sucked their taste off of Agatha’s fingers and she scowled when Agatha eventually pulled her hand away and began kissing her neck lazily.</p><p>“Let me do it now. Let me. Please.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything until she’d caught her breath and then she raised up, pinker than her shirt that still laid somewhere on the bed.</p><p>“I need to be made yours. To be reminded of who I belong to. You can’t do that properly yet so I won’t allow it.”</p><p>Rio groaned and tried to reach down between them but Agatha stopped her by trapping her wrist. Her eyes flashed but whether from annoyance or need, Rio couldn’t tell. She just knew it was a no.</p><p>“Agatha, you have no idea how-…”</p><p>Agatha had pulled away again, was now sitting astride her stomach, letting her feel how soaked she was. It only made Rio want her more.</p><p>“As much as you think you want me, I promise you that I want you ten times more.”</p><p>She was leaving now, leaving before Rio’s slow, ineffectual body could grab her back. When she was standing at the edge of the bed she turned back around and said the cruelest sentence she’d ever uttered to Rio.</p><p>“And know that you’d be the first and only person to ever fuck my ass.”</p><p>Rio was left to throw a tantrum in the middle of the bed. Agatha had stormed away, grabbing her pyjamas and her robe as she went. It was sick that she was being made to wait. Sick that Agatha wouldn’t give her what they both wanted.</p><p>It took her a few minutes to calm down enough to be able to jump in the shower. Her whole body ached with need now. Need to wipe the smirk off of Agatha’s bratty face, need to do as she’d promised.</p><p>Under the stream of warm water her needs dissolved as she thought of everything that had happened since Berkeley. The revelation, the shouting, the gifts, the cautious proximity, the showing up, the invite to Boston, the retrieval in front of the paps, the sex, the agreement to get married.</p><p>It was all so fast and yet not fast enough.</p><p>She’d woken up yesterday morning thinking she’d have to wait weeks for Agatha to kiss her again, and that was if Agatha didn’t get bored in the meantime. And now? Now she was showering in her girlfriend’s Boston home, about to have breakfast with the little boy who looked like her.</p><p>She felt like she was floating, like none of it was real.</p><p>But the way Agatha looked at her was always real.</p><p>The way she told her now what she wanted, how she felt.</p><p>The way she wanted to share what her therapist was saying.</p><p>The way she checked in with Alice to make sure Rio was being cared for.</p><p>Alice.</p><p>She needed to call her.</p><p>When she got out of the shower she dried herself, used some of Agatha’s lotions and potions, and then dressed herself back in the clothes she’d originally entered this bedroom in. Minus one thing: her tank top. Agatha had requested access, so she’d give her as much as she could.</p><p>She added, too, the watch she’d bought to match with Nicky. It flashed happily at her from her wrist and she smiled at it for a second before checking her reflection and leaving.</p><p>When she left the room she already heard the distant sounds of a radio playing. Some corny love song floated up to her and she smiled as she made her way down the stairs. Before she turned into the kitchen she grabbed her scarf from the hook and wrapped it securely around her neck. It would hide Agatha’s marks but she’d have to make an excuse for wearing it indoors.</p><p>Nicky’s voice could be heard as she made her way to the kitchen, followed by Agatha’s.</p><p>“I was wondering if she would like to.”</p><p>“You’ll just have to ask her, honey.”</p><p>“Can you ask her? And then maybe I can ask her and-… melliza!”</p><p>Rio grinned at the sight of Nicky kneeling up on his stool against the kitchen island, his frown disappearing the moment she stepped into sight.</p><p>“Ask who what? Me?”</p><p>Nicky went a little pink and Agatha, where she stood with her back to them both making pancakes, calmly said: “Go ahead, honey. She doesn’t bite.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows as she took the stool beside Nicky, finding a steaming mug of coffee already waiting for her there.</p><p>“What is it, mellizo?”</p><p>Nicky fidgeted, toying with his glass of orange juice. “Mama has to work next Saturday and I will be with Lucy. Only… only maybe I could be with you instead? Please?”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and looked up when Agatha turned around and shot her a small, amused smile. But Rio felt only panic, only sudden, unexpected fear.</p><p>“Oh. I…”</p><p>“You don’t want to,” Nicky concluded before Rio could think of anything else to say. She looked to him and his entire face had fallen. He looked a lot like he had in the arena when he’d been pulled away and Rio couldn’t stand it. Couldn’t stand letting her fear get in the way of his happiness.</p><p>“You didn’t let me finish!” She said quickly, throwing her hands up in the air as if she were exasperated, “I was trying to think of a word!”</p><p>“A word?” Nicky asked cautiously.</p><p>“Yes. Let me think.”</p><p>She made a show of frowning deeply, now tapping her chin, now stroking her beard.</p><p>“Hmmm. I think that would be… the best!”</p><p>Nicky gasped, and then dissolved into giggles as Rio dived for him and attacked his sides. “T-that isn’t e-even a b-big word!” He protested as she continued to tickle him all over, only relenting when she thought she’d shaken the sad out of him.</p><p>She grinned as she sat back and touched his rosy cheek briefly, “But it’s a good word to describe how Saturday will be, right?”</p><p>“A very good word.”</p><p>Rio nodded her agreement and then felt a warm hand slip below her sweatshirt and land neatly on her lower back. She bit the inside of her cheek as Agatha leant between them and placed Nicky’s breakfast down.</p><p>“French toast. A birthday weekend treat.”</p><p>Nicky yummed his approval, already reaching for the syrup as Agatha turned to Rio and mouthed, “Thank you.” Her fingers flexed against her back and Rio knew she was thanking her for two things in that moment.</p><p>“More french toast,” Agatha announced, pulling away from the two at the island, “Coming up. An extra big portion for Rio too. She needs her energy for chasing after very speedy bike riders.”</p><p>Nicky laughed around his mouthful of toast and Rio caught Agatha wink at her over her shoulder. Her cheeks felt warm all of a sudden, and she knew they’d be as pink as Nicky’s had been a moment ago. But that was okay. If you couldn’t blush in front of your girlfriend, who could you blush in front of?</p><p>Nicky ate silently, hurriedly, and Rio recognised in him a similar habit of hers. See food, eat food. When she was feeling up to it, that was. The usually neat and polite little kid was shovelling the food into his face as quickly as he could make his fork go and Rio would have asked why but something told her it was because he’d been promised a bike ride and he wanted it to happen as soon as possible.</p><p>She couldn’t let him down. Or his mother.</p><p>The promised pile of toast was soon placed before her and Rio wasted no time, only briefly to tug Agatha down and kiss her cheek in thanks, in doing as Nicky did. She barely chewed, only focused on eating as much as quickly as she could.</p><p>Agatha, looking between her son and her girlfriend, had opted for the more sophisticated option of yoghurt and granola. And she ate that steadily, rather than shovelling it. But smiled around her spoon every time she looked up at the two people before her. So alike. So ridiculous.</p><p>Nicky finished first, and Rio was quick to point out he’d had a head start. But Agatha told him to drink his juice and then go upstairs to put his clothes on for the day.</p><p>Rio ate faster then, wanting her mouth free to take advantage of having Agatha alone for even a few minutes.</p><p>When they were, she’d just placed her final, humungous mouthful in her mouth when Agatha said, “You didn’t wear your tank top.”</p><p>“Mm mm.” Rio shook her head, chewing quickly before swallowing. “Access.”</p><p>She wiped her mouth, aware she’d probably looked feral and probably very unattractive but Agatha was moving around to her, making her spin on her stool to look up at her. They soon found places to hold each other: Rio held Agatha’s waist, Agatha held her neck.</p><p>“Saturday? You didn’t look like you wanted to do it.”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek, saw the confusion in Agatha’s gaze and quietly admitted: “I was worried. A whole day with him. What if he gets hurt on my watch or I lose him or-…”</p><p>“There’s no one I’d trust more than you to look after my son. No one who protects him more than you do. Nothing will happen to him. He’ll just be so excited to have you all to himself.”</p><p>Rio nodded but couldn’t shake the thoughts from before when Agatha had chopped and changed subjects like she were changing lines on the freeway. Rio’s brain wasn’t working like that, <em>couldn’t</em> work like that right now.</p><p>And Agatha needed to know.</p><p>“I feel, mi vida, I feel slow and, unsteady, and I can’t make… I can’t make my brain catch up or go at its usual speed and I just-…”</p><p>Agatha’s face had fallen, her entire expression suddenly full of concern.</p><p>“I don’t feel like myself,” Rio concluded gently, trying her best to explain. “Not truly. Not properly.”</p><p>Agatha’s left hand moved to rest against her chest, pressing over where her heart was. “I know. I know how much pain you must be in and how hard everything feels right now. And it’s my job, as your girlfriend,” she smiled, a small, hopeful smile, “to help you through it.”</p><p>Rio sighed and rested her forehead against Agatha’s chest. Agatha’s fingers moved round again and began to run through her short hair and she relaxed into it as Agatha whispered, “Your doctor’s appointment tomorrow, you’ll tell him… Rio will you tell him what you told me last night?”</p><p>Rio frowned where she rested against Agatha, swimming through the murky waters to find the memory of whatever she’d said. But Agatha had it to hand, and gave it to her in a quiet voice: “That you feel like you want to die?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes closed and she took in a deep breath as she slid her arms more around Agatha and tugged her closer. She was still and silent as she tried to recall the moment she’d said that. But things were still hard to grasp. Memories hazy and feelings merely wisps of moments.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it the way it sounded, I-…”</p><p>Agatha had cupped her chin and was lifting her head to face her. In blue eyes Rio suddenly found the reason Agatha had barely slept and she felt guilty for it, horrendously so.</p><p>“I want to be alive. With you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything until she’d bent to kiss Rio and only after doing so did she say, “For me, tell the doctor for me. Please.”</p><p>Rio nodded, careful to keep Agatha pressed close so she could kiss her again. Agatha sighed against her as she broke the second kiss and Rio felt no less guilty for what she’d unwittingly put her through all night.</p><p>But Agatha’s brain was bouncing to something else where her own could not.</p><p>“Let’s focus on this morning. On tres patitos. He’s so excited to show off for you.”</p><p>Rio smiled at this, and Agatha’s hands slipped again below her scarf to hold her neck.</p><p>“You’re coming too?”</p><p>“And miss the chance for a romantic walk with my girlfriend and crazed young son? Are you kidding?”</p><p>“Say it again.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in amusement, “Girlfriend.”</p><p>The magic of a word. A single, solitary word. One that Rio had never thought much of before. It pulled her from the deep trench of her misery and made her slow brain fizz.</p><p>Rio’s grin grew up her face until she was laughing with it. It was absurd, it was incredible. And Agatha kissed her grin, she kissed her until the laughter turned to soft moans and they only stopped when heavy feet could be heard on the stairs.</p><p>Agatha was back around the island now and Rio was panting as she sipped her cold coffee.</p><p>“I’m ready!” They both looked around to see a shocked Nicky looking at Agatha as if she’d committed the biggest betrayal of his little life. “Mama, you are not ready!”</p><p>Agatha glanced down at her robe as if to say, “who me?” and then marched around to take Nicky’s head in her hands and kiss his cheek. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>She disappeared out the room and shouted over her shoulder: “Stay out of trouble, you two!”</p><p>Nicky giggled as he ran over to Rio and took her hand, “Come see my bike again, please. You can have a go too but I think you might be too big.”</p><p>“Oh, I dunno,” Rio mused as she followed the little boy through to find the green bike. “I can try.”</p><p>Nicky only encouraged her trying and Rio eventually gave in, sitting on the ridiculously small bike and making faces so he’d laugh. They swapped places soon enough when it was clear Rio might actually injure herself if she tried to ride this thing and she helped Nicky to sit on it, holding him upright as he pointed out the gears, the bell, the brakes.</p><p>Nicky, it turned out, was almost as good a distraction from what Rio was now calling ‘the horrors’. He was endlessly cheerful, endlessly curious, endlessly fascinated with anything Rio had to say. She lost herself in bike chat and so jumped when a hand found her back again and Agatha had returned to them.</p><p>“Looks like we’re all ready?”</p><p>“Yes, mama. Rio’s been so ready she’s had her scarf on this whole time!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, bad me, not being ready earlier.” Rio scoffed as she turned to Agatha and raised her arm above her to wrap around her and pull her in.</p><p>“Your mama’s made breakfast though so we forgive her, right?”</p><p>“Definitely.”</p><p>Rio felt the ghost of a kiss to her cheek before Agatha was pulling away and helping Nicky off the bike, “No riding in the house please.”</p><p>“Heard that before,” Rio muttered, earning a sharp kick to her shin from Agatha’s foot.</p><p>Rio was in charge of the bike whilst Agatha helped Nicky zip up his jacket and secure his helmet. The little boy was practically vibrating with excitement by the time they were all bundled up and ready to go.</p><p>Once Agatha had locked up, Rio helped Nicky climb on. She held his shoulders as he began to cycle slowly alongside her and Agatha jogged along to catch up.</p><p>“We gotta go slow around here for a bit, just to make sure there are no cars or pedestrians and then once we’re across the main road we can go to the common and-…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly, panic laced in her voice, “No, we’ll stick to side streets.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and looked up at her but Agatha just shook her head and Rio’s stomach sank. Two Oscar winners with a little boy on a bike might be too exposed in the common. Rio’s hold on Nicky tightened a little as she thought over their options.</p><p>Potential exposure in the common but Nicky able to go as fast as his little legs could carry him or slow and steady along the side streets where there was less chance they’d be hounded but no chance for Nicky to ride free.</p><p>Agatha seemed to be struggling with the same thoughts so Rio tapped Nicky’s back and said: “Mellizo, see that lamppost up ahead? Ride over to it for me, but stop there and your mom and I will be just a sec. Go steady.”</p><p>She released him after he readily agreed and watched as he started shakily and then straightened his course and made his way to the place she’d pointed out. She stopped Agatha by grabbing her arm.</p><p>“Hey. It’s too crowded? You’re worried we’ll be spotted?”</p><p>“I just… I don’t want to ruin his morning if people…”</p><p>“We’ll be there. Right there with him. I’ve got my cap on, he’s got his helmet, everyone’s all bundled up. It’s not the perfect disguise but if we don’t go, even for a little while, he can’t go fast. And, Agatha, that little boy really wants to go fast. I’ll keep up with him, I promise. I’ll run with him and-…”</p><p>“You’re not able to keep-…”</p><p>“I might be a little slower than I used to be but I have enough reserves to keep up with him, I promise.”</p><p>Agatha looked around to where Nicky was and Rio stepped a little closer, making sure she wasn’t so close that anyone looking out of the windows of the surrounding buildings would think too much of it.</p><p>“I promise.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, slowly turning back to Rio with a tired smile. “I suppose this will be some exercise. Technically under the banner of looking after yourself.”</p><p>“With the added bonus that Nicky will be the happiest boy in the world.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile turned into a grin and she rolled her eyes as she took Rio’s arm and tugged her towards Nicky who was waiting patiently for them by the lamppost.</p><p>“Did you watch me?”</p><p>“Yeah! You’re so cool!”</p><p>Nicky grinned his gap toothed grin and Rio gave hers right back.</p><p>“So,” Agatha clapped her hands to steal her son’s googly-eyed attention away from Rio. “The common we must go!”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes, honey. You can go faster there but only if you promise not to go too fast or too far. Rio’s going to keep alongside you, okay? I want you in my sights at all time.”</p><p>“Okay, mama.”</p><p>Rio grinned at Agatha and, as a trio, they all walked towards the busy road that separated their quiet portion of Boston from the common. It was a cold Sunday morning and Rio could already see that it was getting busier the closer they got. But she and Agatha were flanking Nicky now, letting him ride slowly but steadily between them.</p><p>They crossed at the lights and Rio kept her face forwards her but eyes alert to ensure no one had either clocked them or was already approaching. It didn’t take long for some gasps to be heard nearby but for now, no one came near.</p><p>The entrance to the common was open, for the most part. And they were on the side closest to the frog pond so both women let Nicky go ahead a little, with the warning to be careful and to not yet go too fast.</p><p>His take off this time wasn’t as unsteady and Rio grinned at the sight of him speeding off, paying heed to his mother’s instruction to be careful. Agatha looped her arm into hers and squeezed her as she whispered, “Thank you. He needs this. He deserves this.”</p><p>Suddenly people glancing their way didn’t seem so bad. Agatha was clinging to her arm, Nicky was riding happily ahead, pausing every so often to stop and look back at them, and they could be mistaken for any other happy family.</p><p>Other than the fact that occasionally someone took a photo of them.</p><p>“There’s a coffee stand not too far up ahead,” Rio said after a while of walking along in comfortable silence. “Will I catch up with him and let him race there?”</p><p>“Go easy,” Agatha said as she stopped them both and turned to look at Rio properly. Rio could see the concern suddenly in her eyes, the same look she’d given her countless times the night before. It made her want to lean in, want to kiss that look away. But she held her ground, only smiled, only nodded, and the darted off to jog after Nicky who’d dutifully stopped not too far away.</p><p>“Hey! Let’s see how fast this puppy can go, okay? There’s a coffee stand just straight ahead. So we’re gonna head towards it and you can go as fast as you want and I’ll do my best to keep up okay? But remember, there are people about so be careful. Remember how to use your brakes?”</p><p>“Sí, melliza.”</p><p>“Okay, good.” She stepped back, surveyed Nicky for a second and then said, “On three! One… two!”</p><p>She burst off before she finished her countdown and heard Nicky laugh behind her, shouting her name as he hurried to catch up.</p><p>He soon did but that wasn’t the point. The point was that Rio felt alive. The point was that she was moving her body in a way she had neglected to for weeks now. The point was that the little boy on the little green bike was giggling as he streaked past her.</p><p>The point was that his mother wasn’t far behind, smiling at the two of them.</p><p>Rio could feel the burn of the cool air in her throat as she forced herself to keep her speed up. She could feel the groan of each limb as she made them do what they used to be so good at, but had since forgotten the joy of.</p><p>Her mind took her to foot races with her dad. To days when he’d take her to this very common and toss a ball around with her in the green to celebrate their beloved team winning. She thought of the desperate way she’d gasp for air as he flung her into his arms and span her around.</p><p>She thought of what it meant to feel joy and that she was now able to give some to Nicky.</p><p>She hoped he felt it, hoped he’d remember it in years to come when she’d gone up to meet her dad again.</p><p>Nicky was just up ahead. In spite of his desire to go fast he’d stopped to check Rio was following still. He was grinning at her. He felt her joy. She laughed as she flew past him again, shouting an encouraging, “vamos, mellizo!”</p><p>Nicky was soon passing her again but still she didn’t mind. Her limbs were paying attention now. She was flying.</p><p>The coffee stand at the end of the pathway was in view now and Rio kept going until she reached Nicky, parked up just a few feet from it. He was beaming at her, his cheeks flushed and his eyes wide.</p><p>“You run so fast!”</p><p>“Not as fast as you.”</p><p>Rio was panting softly, replacing her cap on her head. She felt on the verge of total, resplendent collapse. But the strain on her lungs had been worth it. She felt different now. She felt free. Agatha had been right. She did need to start looking after herself. She had to move her body more, had to make more of an effort.</p><p>After all, the reward would be worth it.</p><p>And the reward arrived just as Rio was breathing normally again. Agatha squeezed her elbow and ducked below Nicky’s helmet to check on him. “That was so fast!”</p><p>“Did you see?!”</p><p>“Oh I saw, honey. You were so fast I almost lost you.”</p><p>Nicky grinned and Agatha kissed her son’s cheek, “Hot chocolate?”</p><p>Rio, however, was looking around them, and had already spotted a couple of women nearby eyeing them up. She moved a little closer to Agatha, suddenly unsure but extremely tense.</p><p>“Hey,” she said as casually as she could. “Two over there.” She pointed to herself but hoped Agatha would know she meant behind her. “Think they might-…”</p><p>Agatha’s whole face changed instantly. She paled, her jaw flexing, her gaze sharpening.</p><p>“Will you take Nicky? I’ll go fetch drinks.”</p><p>Rio nodded mutely and wasted no time in ushering Nicky further away from the coffee stand until they were at a bench far enough away that they could have a good view of Agatha without being close enough to hear anything.</p><p>“Who are those ladies talking to mama?”</p><p>Nicky had dismounted now and was cradling his helmet in his lap, sitting next to Rio on the bench.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said lamely, “they’re fans of your mama’s work.”</p><p>“Mama gets annoyed when fans try to talk to her. Maybe we should go and tell them no.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and reached her arm around Nicky to pull him closer into her side. “She seems okay right now.”</p><p>“You have fans too,” Nicky pointed out, a slight frown on his face where he focused in on Agatha talking to the two women.</p><p>“I do, baby.”</p><p>“Do you like them?”</p><p>Rio thought about it for a second. “Some of them.”</p><p>“They’re nice to you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Okay. Good. I don’t want anybody to be mean to you.”</p><p>Rio smiled, but only slightly, her gaze was still on Agatha, on the women with her. She’d been talking to them for much longer than she’d thought she might. Maybe a minute now? Maybe longer. But she couldn’t leave Nicky. And she couldn’t take him over.</p><p>Nicky seemed to notice her concern and he shuffled where he sat to gaze up at her, still frowning his older-than-his-years frown. “Did you have a fight with mama?”</p><p>“What?” Rio’s attention was back on Nicky now, “When? No, of course not.”</p><p>“I woke up late last night and I thought I heard shouting.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, hoping it was the shouting portion of the evening he’d heard and nothing else. “No, Nicky, it was-…”</p><p>“Mellizo.”</p><p>“No, honey, ‘melliza’.”</p><p>“No,” Nicky shuffled more, wrestling with himself until he was on his knees facing Rio on the bench. “You call me ‘mellizo’.”</p><p>Rio’s arms had moved to try and prevent Nicky from falling in the shuffle, though she knew he was okay. It was a reflex, one she didn’t even know she had.</p><p>“Not Nicky?”</p><p>And then Nicky pulled a face that was half him, half his mother. It made Rio grin.</p><p>“I like mellizo.”</p><p>“Okay, baby. Oh. Is baby okay? What about honey? Sweetheart? Patito?”</p><p>Nicky was still scowling, but Rio knew he was okay because he was placing his helmet in her lap and shuffling closer. He was a mini Agatha, all bark but no bite. Not for Rio, anyway.</p><p>“River is also okay. Because it’s your name too. I learnt it the other day.”</p><p>Rio’s heart stuttered in her chest. “You did?”</p><p>“Yes, your name means my name.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond a noise nearby alerted her to Agatha’s arrival and she turned to grin up at her, leaning to gently pry two of the cups from her hands. Agatha did not look pleased.</p><p>“All okay?”</p><p>“One’s coco,” Agatha offered, nodding at the two cups in Rio’s hands. Rio sniffed one and gave Nicky the one that smelled of chocolate.</p><p>“Careful, it’ll be too hot right now.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and shuffled to sit properly again on the bench. Rio reached for him once more and Agatha settled beside him. She still looked pissed.</p><p>“What were you talking about?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal’s new girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open and Nicky beside her gasped, “Who, mama?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat because she already knew who Agatha was going to say. Not her actual girlfriend, but Wanda.</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>Rio sighed and Nicky’s head spun round to her so quickly that even where he’d been so careful before in holding his hot chocolate he was suddenly spilling it over his hands.</p><p>“You said she wasn’t.”</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha jumped in before Rio could, gently wiping his hands and taking his cup from him so he couldn’t spill any more. Clearly she’d planned ahead because she had napkins ready in her pocket and placed the cups on the ground before wiping Nicky’s fingers and mopping up the few spots of hot chocolate on his jacket.</p><p>“She isn’t,” Rio insisted gently, “she’s just a friend. Your mama knows that too, don’t you, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything and made as if she were still cleaning Nicky’s, admittedly now, clean hands.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Blue eyes darted up furtively, and as Agatha met her gaze she softened a little, her initial frustration melting somewhat under Rio’s steadiness.</p><p>“No, honey, Wanda isn’t Rio’s girlfriend. Some people are just… they got it wrong.”</p><p>Nicky hadn’t looked away from Rio this whole time and Rio looked back at him now, feeling somehow guilty that Nicky felt any which way about her having a girlfriend. He was still frowning, still looking so like his mother.</p><p>“Mi mellizo,” she said quietly, watching as Nicky’s gaze slowly drifted down to the hand she was offering to him. “I would never lie to you.”</p><p>Rio glanced at a guilty looking Agatha and shot her a small smile before she looked down just in time to see Nicky taking her offered hand. She wrapped her fingers around his and ducked her head down to whisper to him: “Wanna know a secret? You can’t tell anyone. Only your mama. You and your mama are my two favourite people.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Sí, mellizo. Tres patitos, ¿recuerdas?”</p><p>Nicky grinned at her, taking a second before he agreed, “Tres patitos.”</p><p>Rio laughed at his enthusiasm and sat back up again, taking a sip of her too-hot coffee and grimacing the moment it touched the tip of her tongue. “Agh. Shit.”</p><p>She stuck her tongue out and went cross-eyed to see it, making Nicky burst into a fit of laughter and Agatha across from her try to hide her adoring smile with an added roll of her eyes.</p><p>“Showing off for my son, are you?”</p><p>“‘Urnin’ ‘y ‘ongue,” Rio corrected with her mouth open and her tongue still half out, seeking the cool air to calm it.</p><p>“Juvenile.”</p><p>“Silly.”</p><p>Rio grinned and the stuck her tongue properly out at Nicky only for him to do the exact same to her. Her anxiety calmed in that instant and she grinned at him, then shot that same grin Agatha’s way and saw that she was a little misty-eyed. She wished then that they were somewhere private, somewhere Rio could reach around to pull her close.</p><p>She knew she still couldn’t kiss Agatha with Nicky there but she could hold her, and that had to be enough.</p><p>“Why don’t we cycle some more and we can drink as we go?”</p><p>“I can be the official hot chocolate holder for Mr Nicholas Harkness.”</p><p>“Mm’kay,” Nicky hummed happily as he went to fetch his bike but Rio was more interested in the fingers that grazed her own as she took the hot chocolate from Agatha. For just a second they were connected again. But then it was over, and they were back to focusing on Nicky.</p><p>In Agatha’s gaze Rio had caught at least some of the yearning she felt.</p><p>It didn’t make it any easier.</p><p>Nicky now cycled just a little ahead, his path truncated by quick stops to look back and make sure he was close. He smiled every time he saw Rio and Agatha walking along not far behind.</p><p>Agatha now had Rio’s arm again, and they were walking along like any other couple in the park.</p><p>“The girls before,” Agatha said in a low voice as Nicky turned back to kick off and ride slowly ahead again. “They wanted to meet you. Were asking about Wanda. Wanted to know how long you’d been together, was it serious.”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly, felt Agatha’s hand flex around her bicep. Even through her heavy jacket she could feel the tension in her fingers.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Nicky had stopped to look back and grinned before kicking off again.</p><p>“I said that if it were true then Wanda was a very lucky woman but they couldn’t meet you because you were looking after my son.”</p><p>Rio nodded again and shot Agatha a look, finding that Agatha was already watching her. “You complimented me even though you were furious?”</p><p>Agatha looked away then.</p><p>“Do you want to kiss me?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Nicky had stopped once more, checking, grinning, and then he pushed back off again.</p><p>“Kiss me? Do you… do you want to?”</p><p>Rio frowned as she looked back around and this time Agatha wasn’t looking her way.</p><p>“Is that a trick question?”</p><p>“No, a very simple one. Yes or no is fine.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t get a hold on what Agatha was asking, or why she was asking it. Because the answer was <em>yes, all the time, constantly</em>, but that seemed too easy, too obvious.</p><p>But Agatha had clearly grown bored because she answered before Rio had even opened her mouth, “I’m asking because it’s what I’d like to do. Here. Now. Then. When they asked, when I came over with the drinks, after you burnt your tongue, right now as we’re walking. And it’s constant. And I can’t shake it.”</p><p>Rio turned her face away, seeking solace in the oblivious little boy now stopped and checking again.</p><p>“Tonight,” Rio said after Nicky turned back to go again, “Tonight we can-…”</p><p>“I don’t think you understand.”</p><p>Agatha had tugged her arm, had pulled her to a stop. For a shimmering moment in time, Rio thought she was about to kiss her. But Agatha’s face was too haunted for that. She was too pained.</p><p>Agatha glanced away, looking back to Nicky for a second before she turned to Rio.</p><p>“I can’t stand it.”</p><p>“My love,” Rio breathed out, suddenly more aware than ever that they were in public. That eyes and cameras were on them wherever they went. That Nicky, now stopped and turned again, waiting patiently for them to start moving, couldn’t know what was going on between them.</p><p>Agatha dropped her arm. She pulled away and Rio had no choice but to follow.</p><p>This time Nicky didn’t move and Agatha reached him before Rio did. He took his hot chocolate and was instructed by his mom to blow on it before he took a sip. Rio just watched, just stood there in her inability to do anything to fix what Agatha needed fixing.</p><p>She couldn’t even reach out to her properly, couldn’t hold her hand. But later, later she could do that.</p><p>She stepped in as Agatha was adjusting Nicky’s helmet.</p><p>“How about, when we’re all cycled out, we pile up back home and get all warm and watch a movie? Before we all have to leave?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glance but it was Nicky who picked up the bait first, “Can we stay? It’s nice here. It’s colder and Celtics are here and-…”</p><p>“Honey, we all need to fly home tonight. Rio and I have work tomorrow and you’ve got school. Don’t you want to show off your new bike to your friends?”</p><p>Nicky thought on this for a second and then agreed, “They’ll love it!”</p><p>“Then let’s make the most of being tres patitos in Boston today, okay?”</p><p>“Si, mama. Okay.”</p><p>Rio took Nicky’s cup back from him after he took another gulp and turned to speed off again. She sipped her coffee just for something to do.</p><p>“Another movie?” Agatha asked suspiciously as she settled in step with Rio once more, her hand already wrapped around her arm.</p><p>“Well,” Rio took a sip of her coffee, trying to play down the tension she felt between them. Like the string of a violin, it longed to be played, allowing for different tones to be emitted with each light press of pressure.</p><p>Rio’s words were a steady not, sitting below the stave. Her note wasn’t pushing or pulling, nor did it waver.  It was steady, supporting the melody that was in its infancy still, waiting for time to write it.</p><p>“It’s the only time I can hold you when Nicky’s close. And I want to hold you as much as I want to kiss you.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a breath beside her, took a sip of her own coffee, and in clearing her throat she said. “Then a movie it is.”</p><p>Nicky had stopped again and this time didn’t start cycling again. He instead waited for his fellow ducklings to catch up and his grin never once faltered. “Can I have my coco, please?”</p><p>“Of course, melizzo. Cycling is hard work.”</p><p>“Mmhm,” Nicky agreed, taking Rio very seriously as he took several large gulps of his hot chocolate and created for himself a chocolate moustache. Rio laughed at the sight and Agatha swooped in to clean it gently off.</p><p>Their brief distraction, their focusing on the little boy with the green bike, meant that Rio didn’t notice the couple as they approached. She was only alerted to their presence when she heard Agatha’s name over her shoulder.</p><p>Both women turned and both stepped a little closer to Nicky.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness! Oh my GOD!! We are, such fans, I mean… wow! You were robbed by the way. That Oscar should have been yours. I mean, <em>wow!</em>”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek and tried not to laugh as Agatha put on her most gracious voice and thanked the clearly insane woman before her. The man standing beside her looked like he’d rather be <em>anywhere</em> else.</p><p>“Thank you. It’s always great to meet a fan. But if you don’t mind, I’m here with my son so I should be getting along.”</p><p>To Rio’s horror the woman leant around Agatha, ignoring Rio’s presence entirely, to get a look at Nicky. “Oh and isn’t he a sweetheart! You must look like your daddy. I bet he’s handsome too!”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat purposefully and moved to block the woman, placing a hand on her arm as Rio turned to steal Nicky’s attention back. He looked as serious as he ever had and his brow was as furrowed as Rio’s was.</p><p>“C’mon, lift your legs off the pedals and I’ll steer you.”</p><p>Nicky did as he was told and with some difficultly given she was still carrying a nearly full coffee, Rio pushed Nicky away from Agatha and the fan so he wouldn’t be subjected to anymore ogling.</p><p>Agatha soon wasn’t far behind and she touched Nicky’s back when she caught up. “You okay, honey?”</p><p>Rio glanced around them before steering them all in the direction of a bench.</p><p>“I don’t look like daddy,” Nicky said quietly, placing his foot gingerly on the ground when Rio had stopped them. “Nobody says I do. Why did that lady think I did?”</p><p>Agatha crouched down and Rio stood tall with her hand on his shoulder still, her eyes cast around the place to make sure no one was even close to approaching again.</p><p>“Because, honey, it’s just what people say. People assume you either look like me or your daddy.”</p><p>“I look like Rio. Handsome like Rio.”</p><p>“Very handsome like Rio.”</p><p>Rio turned back then and bent round to kiss Nicky’s cheek beneath his helmet. “Shall we ride all the way back home without stopping? I’ll race you back to the edge of the park?”</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up and Rio grinned down at him, thrilled she could elicit this reaction from something so simple. Just attention and play. She turned to Agatha and raised her brows, “Would you like to race too?”</p><p>“No, no. I think I’ll leave it to the professionals.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and Rio took his cup and checked he was done with it before she tossed it with her own into the trash.</p><p>“Okay, on your marks, get set,” Nicky pushed off before she did this time and Rio laughed as he streaked ahead and almost forgot to chase after him. But she did. And it felt just as good as the first time.</p><p>Her body was a little less reluctant the second go around. It still felt heavy and slow but it’s moved with more fluidity, more desire to <em>keep</em> moving, and to keep moving faster.</p><p>Nicky kept checking where she was and each time he did Rio’s grin grew impossibly larger across her face. Her lungs were straining for breath but her legs didn’t know. They carried her to the edge of the park where she thundered her steps as she attempted to slow and finally halt by Nicky.</p><p>Panting heavily and red in the face, she placed her hands on her knees and swallowed deep breaths to try and relax her heart now hammering against her chest.</p><p>“I… almost… had you.”</p><p>Nicky laughed and shook his head, leaning over to the side with his bike to pat Rio’s back, “Good race, melliza. You were so fast.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she straightened up and stretched her arms above her head, bending her neck back to blink up at the sky. “God I need to start exercising again.”</p><p>She heard Nicky adjust his bike so he could tiptoe it closer to her and soon felt his small hand on her jacket. “We can play more basketball if you want to?”</p><p>Nicky was grinning up at her, his helmet having slipped a little so he had to really tilt his head to see her. She adjusted it for him and grinned when more of his face came into view.</p><p>“Yeah? How about a game that goes on forever? We just need to hit infinity and then we can stop.”</p><p>Nicky beamed in wonder at this, his clutch on Rio’s jacket tightening. “Infinity?! That’s so much!”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>“So who won?”</p><p>Agatha had arrived, smug in her ability to breathe normally where Rio was still struggling.</p><p>“Your son.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Agatha swooped in and lavished the winner in kisses and Rio suddenly wished that <em>she’d</em> won. Only when Agatha relented her attack did she speak up: “What does the loser get?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed to her own, a strange mix of teasing and longing. “All the purple Skittles you can eat.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.</p><p>“That doesn’t really seem fair.”</p><p>“Why? There’s a whole bunch of them in the bowl in the kitchen.”</p><p>Rio huffed as they made for the exit and Agatha kept a hold on Nicky’s shoulder. “So I’m just your purple Skittle eater now?”</p><p>“Perhaps you should’ve won.”</p><p>A low blow. Softened by the hand that reached out and curled back around Rio’s bicep. The gentle squeeze it gave told Rio that Agatha would have given her the same treatment she gave her son, regardless of whether Rio won or not, if she’d been at all able to.</p><p>So, for now, the purple Skittle eater, was happy enough to walk along with her two fellow ducklings - one of whom was talking about how many games it could possibly take to reach infinity points.</p><p>When they got in, Rio removed her jacket but not her scarf, and helped Nicky with his helmet as Agatha rested the bike up against the wall. It was soon decided that Rio would go set up the tv so they’d all be ready to watch ‘How To Train Your Dragon 2’, Agatha would go fetch snacks, and Nicky would help with drinks.</p><p>By the time Rio was standing before the tv in the cosy family room, she was feeling less murky than usual. Maybe it was the fresh air, maybe it was the - mostly - uninterrupted morning with her two favourite people. It didn’t matter why, it just mattered that she felt no pain, experienced no slowness, wasn’t struggling to keep her mind in check.</p><p>She found the movie, clicked to play it and paused before the first note of the credits could sound.</p><p>Rio then situated herself on the couch. She placed a cushion by the arm and rested her head against it. She spread her legs out and just as she was figuring out what to do with her arms Agatha appeared beside her.</p><p>“Are you going to sleep?”</p><p>“No. You are.”</p><p>Rio grinned as Agatha arched a brow and ignored the arms that were now held out to her.</p><p>“Actually I’m watching a movie.”</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Rio’s grin didn’t falter even as Agatha’s frown deepened. “If I lie on you I’ll sleep.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and began to wriggle her fingers. Nicky entered, stage left, and Rio, without looking at him said: “Mellizo, please tell your mama she needs to nap.”</p><p>“Mama, melliza says you should nap so I think maybe you should.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes this and muttered “traitor” before she took a seat by Rio’s feet and curled her legs beneath herself. Rio only hummed in amusement, propping herself up on her elbows to get a good look at her.</p><p>“So stubborn.”</p><p>“So stubborn,” Nicky agreed as if Rio had just said the wisest thing he’d ever heard. He was now sitting on the floor with his bowl of grapes, close enough to Rio’s head that he could turn around and offer her one.</p><p>She gladly accepted and popped it in her mouth before she fell onto her back again.</p><p>Agatha would give in eventually. She just had to give her time.</p><p>The movie started and even after the credits, Agatha hadn’t moved. Nicky continued to offer Rio grapes and she continued to gladly accept them. It went: one for Nicky, one for Rio.</p><p>After grape number fifteen for both of them, a certain someone crawled up Rio’s body and collapsed down against her without so much as a word. Rio, intent on Agatha sleeping and not scaring her away, said nothing.</p><p>She simply accepted another grape and wrapped her free arm around Agatha as she slipped her had beneath her scarf to clutch at her collar.</p><p>“This scarf looks ridiculous,” Agatha mumbled petulantly.</p><p>“And who is to blame for that?”</p><p>Agatha huffed but within five minutes she’d fallen asleep.</p><p>Rio didn’t think her plan would work. She thought Agatha might come over, might sit closer, maybe lay with her. But she’d thought Agatha would be too stubborn for sleeping, too aware of herself in front of Nicky. But she’d been asleep on her for twenty minutes now. Her left hand still curled around the collar of her sweatshirt and her head resting against her chest.</p><p>She was half on Rio, half buried between her and the couch. The perfect, most beautiful, weighted blanket.</p><p>Nicky kept glancing over, craning his neck to see Agatha fast asleep, his wide eyes darting from her sleeping form up to Rio’s face, then back to the screen. Every time he did this Rio smiled to herself, counting the seconds until he said something. Which he did, after less than a minute.</p><p>“I’m so tired, melliza.”</p><p>“Oh? You are?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and gave a very poor, but dramatic, performance of yawning. “Yes so tired. Maybe I should take a nap too.”</p><p>Rio’s amused smile became a grin and she watched Nicky watch her for a second before she lifted her arm up and whispered down to him, “Well, there’s plenty of space here if you’re really-…”</p><p>Nicky was already moving before she’d finished her sentence. He scrambled up and soon Rio had two weighted blankets over her. One significantly smaller and warmer than the other.</p><p>She kissed the top of Nicky’s head as Agatha made a soft noise in her sleep and Nicky placed his hand over his mama’s where it was tucked beneath her scarf.</p><p>“Don’t you want to watch your movie?”</p><p>“No. This is better.”</p><p>Rio looked up at the ceiling and smiled at it because she could no longer smile at the boy now buried against her in an exact mirror image of his mom.</p><p>“Okay,” she uttered after a few seconds, “I’ll wake you up soon then.”</p><p>She felt Nicky nod against her. After a few minutes of silence she knew Nicky wasn’t asleep yet. He shifted every so often, but made no noise and Rio just knew he was trying his best to pretend to be fast asleep just like his mama.</p><p>She wondered if it were because he wanted to be doing everything Agatha was doing. Or maybe it was because he’d never seen Agatha cradled like this. It was a sight so unusual that he had to be a part of it. His melizza and his mama.</p><p>Tres patitos. All cuddled and warm.</p><p>Over an hour later, Rio cautiously lifted her arm from Nicky to check the time and when she saw it was almost two, she angled her head down and gently whispered, “Mi vida? Agatha?” She squeezed her side gently, knowing Nicky was already awake. “Time to wake up.”</p><p>It made Agatha twitch awake against her and Nicky welcomed her back to the land of the living with a gentle: “Hey, mama. Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>Agatha was slow to wake, and Rio felt her nuzzle in, felt her rumble her agreement against her.</p><p>“Mm’yeah.”</p><p>Nicky shifted up as Rio smiled and allowed him to whisper against her ear, “I slept good too.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned her head to look at Nicky now just inches from her own face. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. So good that… that maybe we can have a proper sleepover and me and mama can sleep like this again.”</p><p>Rio grinned and asked, “Did you sleep though, mellizo? I was sure you were still awake.”</p><p>She felt Agatha laugh against her chest and saw Nicky’s cheeks flush a soft pink. “I was resting.”</p><p>“Resting?”</p><p>“Sí.”</p><p>Rio hummed and lifted her hand to mess Nicky’s already messy hair. “You are so like your mama.”</p><p>“Cute as a button and very smart?” Agatha this time. Nicky’s grin appeared again and he raised his brows as if that was exactly what Rio had been getting at. She smiled up at him, and though it hadn’t been exactly what she was getting at it wasn’t technically untrue.</p><p>“The cutest and the smartest.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and scurried back down again to be level with Agatha. In a stage whisper he said: “I think we are all cute and smart.”</p><p>“Me too, honey. But maybe you the most.”</p><p>“Noooooo,” Nicky protested as Rio ticked his side and Agatha tapped his nose.</p><p>“But this cute and smart boy needs to go pack his things. We have to get ready for the flight. I’ll be up to help in a minute, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and rolled from Rio’s hold to quite literally fall onto the floor. But he bounced back up and Rio only had to panic for a second whilst Agatha remained calmly where she was. He was hurrying out the door before she could even shout after him, “Careful up the stairs please!”</p><p>Rio laughed as Agatha grumbled a quiet, “Oh to be young and not afraid of pulling your back.”</p><p>“You’re still young.”</p><p>“You once told me I’d be playing your mom in a movie soon.”</p><p>“And now you’re playing my wife.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly, rolling too but stopping once she was fully over Rio, unworried about pressing her whole body weight into her as she held her cheeks. “A different kind of mommy, I guess.”</p><p>“You said you wouldn’t tease.”</p><p>“No I believe <em>you</em> asked me not to and I didn’t agree.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes but Agatha just grinned down at her, looking more energised than she had all day. And Rio was pleased, despite her scowl.</p><p>“You are going to be the death of me.”</p><p>“I think we established that that is the <em>last</em> thing I want.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and huffed but said nothing because Agatha was sitting up now and pulling Rio with her. “This Saturday? I’m with my lawyers all day but I’ll be home before the news breaks. Can you keep Nicky occupied and have him back by, say, four?”</p><p>Rio nodded, the answer to taking Nicky for the day now much easier to give. Then again, anything felt easy to agree to with Agatha in her lap.</p><p>Agatha tugged at her scarf, peeking beneath it to see what it was covering. “Thank you.”</p><p>Her fingertips grazed over what Rio knew must have been one of the marks she’d left and she smiled just a little, still in awe of the way Agatha looked at her sometimes.</p><p>“Do you think he enjoyed today? The bike ride, I mean?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze rose to meet her own and she looked surprised for a second before she answered, “I can only imagine how excited he’ll be to go back home and tell all his friends about it. I don’t think you know how much he loves you.”</p><p>“A little less than I love him, maybe.”</p><p>Agatha hummed gently, slipping her hand from beneath Rio’s scarf to hold her cheek, “I sometimes don’t believe my luck. I just keep… waiting for the bad to happen.”</p><p>“What bad?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer and as her thumb brushed down to graze Rio’s lips there was a noise in the hall that suggested Nicky was hurrying back. Agatha was quick to slip away and Rio turned just in time to see a flustered Nicky standing in the doorway with a big grin.</p><p>“All packed, mama.”</p><p>Agatha hummed suspiciously and went to kiss Nicky’s head. “Rio will make you a sandwich and I’ll go check you’ve got everything, okay?”</p><p>Rio was standing, already keen to oblige when Agatha turned to her and pointed, “Sandwich for you too. Big one.”</p><p>“¡Mandona!”</p><p>Agatha winked and Rio rolled her eyes as she walked through to the kitchen with Nicky trailing close behind.</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“It means your mom is really good at taking care of people.”</p><p>“She’s very good at that.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself as she opened the fridge and began to rummage for ingredients. “Okay, okay, pick your poison. We got: cheese, tomatoes, ham,” she held up some prosciutto, “fancy ham, peanut butter, jel-…”</p><p>“Peanut butter!”</p><p>Rio paused and turned with a grin to see Nicky leaning up on the stool across the counter, half crawling on top of it. “Do we have a winner?”</p><p>“Yes and jelly too, please.”</p><p>“PB&amp;J it is.”</p><p>“You too?”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“But,” Rio paused, “Let’s make your mom something fancier.”</p><p>“Yes good idea, mi vida.”</p><p>Rio paused again, her gaze turning to Nicky where she’d been grabbing the prosciutto. She smiled and Nicky just grinned, unaware he’d said anything remotely surprising or unusual.</p><p>“Can I have triangles, please?”</p><p>“You bet.”</p><p>Rio turned the radio on after piling up all the ingredients on the island and Nicky turned the conversation to his favourite topic: basketball.</p><p>“And then in two weeks we have another game and it’s against this other school where all the boys are really, really tall so we might not win but coach says we get pizza either way so that’s okay.”</p><p>“Are you kidding?” Rio sliced the French bread from the side and began to cut it open for Agatha’s much more sophisticated sandwich. “Aren’t you the captain?! Of course you’ll win! I told you before remember, you don’t have to be the tallest to be the best.”</p><p>Nicky nodded thoughtfully and watched as Rio began to slice up their bread. “Maybe if I were a little taller, though.”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said as she lathered on the peanut butter to each slice. “You will get taller, mellizo. But you will always be good at basketball. And that’s more important than height.”</p><p>“Daddy’s tall.”</p><p>“He is.” Rio jammed the knife a little too hard into the jello but Nicky didn’t notice.</p><p>“But mama isn’t very tall. She’s not as tall as you.”</p><p>“No, baby.”</p><p>“So… maybe I’ll be as tall as you. In the middle.”</p><p>“Yup,” Rio agreed, her mind elsewhere now as she placed the finished sandwiches onto a plate for Nicky. “Just like me. In between your mom and dad.”</p><p>She slid the plate across and went to grab Nicky some water and a bag of chips to go with it. The only chips she could find were in a share bag but she figured that was fine. Ducklings shared.</p><p>“Will you come to my game please, melliza? I can save you some pizza.”</p><p>Rio turned with the goods and saw that Agatha had arrived and was leaning against the door frame, watching the two of them carefully. “Your game?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio approached the island again and placed the bag of chips and water down. “I’d love to.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio glanced very briefly at Agatha but in Nicky’s excitement he missed it. Agatha was smiling, and Rio thought she caught a glimmer of pride in her gaze. To distract herself from the warmth filtering from her chest to the rest of her body she went back to finishing Agatha’s sandwich.</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“I hope that isn’t <em>my</em> sandwich there.”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek as Agatha sauntered into the room as if she’d hadn’t just been openly eavesdropping.</p><p>“Nope. Only fancy sandwiches for you.”</p><p>Rio held up one half of her PB&amp;J and grinned, “You can have a bite though, if you want.”</p><p>“I’ll pass.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Rio went back to the fridge to get the arugula she’d spotted earlier and heard the bag of chips being opened.</p><p>“Usually with lunch we have some vegetables or fruit. Did Nicky not tell you that?”</p><p>Rio arched a brow and turned around to see Nicky looking sheepish behind his sandwich, “I got distracted, mama.”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl and held it out to Nicky. “Here, mellizo. Fruit.”</p><p>“Thank you, mi vida.”</p><p>Rio, having heard this new little choice once already, looked to Agatha to see her response to it. Her cheeks were pink and her eyes wide. Nicky didn’t notice so Rio got to enjoy the view all to herself.</p><p>Before Agatha could see that she’d been caught, Rio returned to adding the finishing touches to Agatha’s sandwich, adding the arugula to the prosciutto mozzarella baguette. With a flourish she handed it over and smiled at Agatha’s still pink cheeks.</p><p>Rio leant over the island on her elbows as she picked up her own sandwich. Agatha hadn’t touched hers yet.</p><p>“Nicky, honey…”</p><p>Rio raised her gaze to see where Agatha was going. But Agatha had paused and seemed to reconsider. “Eat your apple, please. But you can have some chips. Just not too many.”</p><p>Nicky took a bite of the fruit as Rio took a handful of chips on to her plate. Agatha stole one without a word and Rio shot her a smile, receiving one back.</p><p>Conversation continued, with Nicky driving it, Rio facilitating it, and Agatha observing it. They talked of basketball, of peanut butter being better than jelly, of what Nicky would do on the flight home (the answer to that was read his book and play his switch).</p><p>It was as Rio was gathering the finished plates that the door went and Agatha went to answer, returning just as Rio and Nicky were stealing more chips from the large bag.</p><p>“One duffel.”</p><p>Agatha placed the bag on the island and Rio blinked at it, momentarily dumbfounded. “I was going to grab that later.”</p><p>“Well, I thought it would be easier to have it brought to you so you didn’t have to chase about town before your flight.”</p><p>“When is your flight, melliza? Soon after ours?”</p><p>“It’s at six. Yours is at-…”</p><p>“Five.”</p><p>“And,” Rio shot Agatha a brief look, catching her nod before she turned back to Nicky, “I’m sleeping over with you again tonight. So we can start our infinity game tomorrow after school?”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Absolutely.”</p><p>“Okay, honey, go and freshen up in the bathroom, we have to get going soon.”</p><p>Nicky ran off without complaint and Rio raised her brows across at Agatha, “Fetching my bag for me now?”</p><p>“I called for it before my nap. Figured you deserved some time to relax before your flight. Seeing as you were such a good mattress for me earlier.”</p><p>“A mattress now, am I?”</p><p>Agatha was moving to her now, stopping just as she came around the corner of the island. She reached for Rio’s scarf and tugged it gently, “A comfy one.”</p><p>“Will you sleep on the plane?”</p><p>“No, I’ll sleep later, when my girlfriend is with me.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, glancing at the entrance to the kitchen before she leant closer and loosely draped her arms around Agatha’s hips. “And we’ll talk?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Plans, how we’ll do this?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes closing as Agatha rested their foreheads together. “Maybe I should come with you to the airport just to make sure-…”</p><p>“You can’t, Rio. We can’t be seen too often together. Not when Nicky is now calling us ‘mi vida’.”</p><p>Rio grinned and opened her eyes to see Agatha grinning back at her, a flush of pride across her features. “He asked me to not call him Nicky earlier, you know. Or less asked, <em>insisted</em>. <em>Very</em> like his mama.”</p><p>“We just want you all to ourselves.”</p><p>Rio hummed and had been just a breath away from Agatha’s lips when Nicky could be heard thundering down the stairs to them. They pulled back and Rio knew that they’d just missed their last opportunity to kiss before they had to part.</p><p>“All ready!”</p><p>Rio’s disappointment didn’t last long when Nicky’s grin existed. She smiled at him and before he could say another thing she’d swaddled him so tightly in her arms that he laughed for it and hugged her right back.</p><p>“You be good for your mama on the plane, okay? It’ll be late by the time I’m back tonight but I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“Sí, melliza. We can play our big game.”</p><p>“The biggest game ever. Maybe we’ll break a world record or something.”</p><p>Nicky hummed and laughed as Rio pulled back and kissed his cheek sweetly, only to have Nicky copy this and kiss her own.</p><p>“I’ve written down the code for the gate,” Agatha was saying somewhere over her shoulder, “Seeing how useless you are on your cell. This is the key for here,” Rio turned and looked to the gold key Agatha was holding up. “And this one is for the house.”</p><p>Rio nodded, doing her best to concentrate on the only two things she had to remember. She pocketed the code that Agatha had just scribbled down. “Okay, easy.”</p><p>Nicky was back on her though and she forgot whether the gold key was for this house or the LA one. She placed her hand on his upper back and looked down at where he was pressed into her side.</p><p>She had been expecting him to say something but he remained silent, his eyes on his mom as he held on. So Rio looked up too and saw Agatha looked far away, locked inside her own world as she stared at the two of them.</p><p>“Gold for Boston,” she eventually said, “Silver for LA.”</p><p>Rio nodded but wasn’t really listening and lifted her arm up for Agatha, only to gather her in a second later. Nicky wriggled from her side to slip between them and soon they were all limbs, no one quite sure which belonged to who.</p><p>Rio could have stayed like this for an eternity. But eternity was interrupted by a knock at the door and they had to separate so Agatha and Nicky could be taken to the airport.</p><p>Rio followed them out, she helped wheel the bike to the car as the suitcases were taken by the driver. She gave Nicky another tight hug, placed her Celtics cap on his head, and then gave Agatha a hug equally as tight before waving them both off.</p><p>And then she was alone again, the door to Agatha’s Boston retreat closed and her back to it. The space felt empty without Agatha’s presence and Nicky’s noise. But she wouldn’t let herself move back into the depths of her misery.</p><p>She focused on Nicky’s promise to play an infinite game with her. She focused on Agatha wanting to talk, wanting to tell her things, wanting to plan. She focused on hopping in the shower to freshen herself up.</p><p>From her duffel she painted on concealer so she could get away with not wearing her Celtics scarf through the airport. She did a reasonable job of it and went overboard by applying a little more to the bags beneath her eyes.</p><p>Rio Vidal still looked tired, a little thinner than she usually would, less viral, less healthy. But whether real or imaginary, her eyes looked brighter.</p><p>Or perhaps it was the magic touch éclat she’d just applied.</p><p>By the time she was done hurrying around the house, making sure it was pristine for whenever Agatha would return, it was time to call a cab to take her to the airport.</p><p>She heaved her duffel over her shoulder and wrapped her scarf around her neck for good measure before she locked the door with the gold key and jumped into the waiting car.</p><p>Her airport experience was much like the one she’d had on her way to Boston. Everyone looked, everyone knew who she was, most people kept their distance. She no longer had her cap to hide behind but she was glad Nicky had had it.</p><p>By the time she was in her seat on the plane she felt exhausted, defeated, lonely. She wished Agatha were beside her, that she could at least feel her arm pressed up against her on on the arm rest, that maybe Nicky could be asking her more questions about basketball - or anything, for that matter.</p><p>The flight was long, too long to be enjoyable. she managed a nap for half of it, and watched a movie for the rest. But really she kept checking her watch, kept seeing how long it would be before she could be back with Agatha. Before they could talk. Before she could be a willing mattress to her.</p><p>At LAX, the paps got her. She kept her gaze ahead, kept her duffel held securely over her shoulder, but couldn’t deny that it bothered her now more than it ever had. Didn’t they know she was grieving? Didn’t they know she could barely think straight, let alone offer the smiles they were requesting?</p><p>A cab took her to Agatha’s house and in it Rio managed to calm her nervous system down enough to be presentable to her girlfriend. Her anxiety had spiked somewhere between disembarking the plane and slipping into the comfy environs of the Mercedes car that carried her to Agatha.</p><p>But she breathed through it. She focused on getting to Agatha and soon she felt more at ease.</p><p>The moment wasn’t lost on Rio as she strode down the garden path of Agatha’s LA home. This was a house that a year ago she could only have dreamed of visiting and now she had a key, she had access.</p><p>Agatha wanted her here. She wanted her here so badly she trusted Rio to come and go when she pleased. She trusted her to be around with her son, to stick around when he’d gone to bed, to have breakfast with them.</p><p>She trusted the woman who sometimes forgot to lock her own front door.</p><p>Rio stepped into the house, heaving the heavy door open, closing it securely and turning the key in the lock again until she heard the clank of the mechanism. It was locked. They were safe.</p><p>“Thank fuck you’re here.”</p><p>Rio’s moment of calm was destroyed the second she heard Alice’s voice. She whipped around, her duffel falling heavily to the floor by her feet as she stared across at the little ball of anxiety that was her best friend.</p><p>“What’s happened?”</p><p>“They’ve been going at it for almost thirty minutes now.”</p><p>“Ralph.”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>Without another word Alice grabbed Rio’s arm and dragged her through the house until they were in touching distance of Agatha’s office door. Through it, she could hear Agatha’s voice: “That is not your <em>job</em>, Jennifer! Your job is to talk to studios, to manage my schedule, to-…”</p><p>Agatha had stopped the moment Rio and Alice had stepped inside. It was like a switch had been flicked. The brunette with the wild hair stormed over to pull Rio to her. Agatha’s body felt rigid against her own, but her hands were gentle as they caressed up and down her back.</p><p>“You’re here. Was the flight okay? Did you-…?”</p><p>She’d pulled back, caressing hands now on her face, searching for any sign of harm that may have befallen her between the Boston house and LAX.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio said with a dazed kind of smile, “What’s happened?”</p><p>Agatha’s wide-eyed look dropped from her face then and her hands moved down to Rio’s arms as Jen behind them said, “Agatha’s pissed I was doing my job well.”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat and Rio watched as she went to stand in front of her girlfriend in a stance Rio knew was protective more than anything else. Rio did the same for Agatha, only her own version. She slid an arm around Agatha’s waist and turned her around to stand beside her, holding her close.</p><p>“You know I’m doing the right thing, Agatha. Don’t be a bitch.”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers flexed against Agatha’s side but she wasn’t holding her enough to prevent Agatha from ripping away from her. Alice made a move to cover Jen but Agatha wasn’t aiming for her, she’d walked to the other end of the room and left Rio by the door.</p><p>“Is someone going to tell me what’s going on?”</p><p>Her eyes remained on Agatha, watching as she buried her fingers in her hair, making it double in volume with her frustrated touch. But Jen answered, her tone full of resentment, smugness, everything that could possibly piss Agatha off.</p><p>“I’ve pulled a profile of you. I’ve been digging for weeks now. I have everything that I need to know ahead of any issues. Any leaks.”</p><p>Rio’s whole body felt hot all of a sudden. Her eyes had moved over to Jen so she missed Agatha swinging back around, her hands fallen from her hair, her gaze on Rio.</p><p>“A… profile?”</p><p>“Like she’s in the fucking FBI or something.”</p><p>“Did you know?” Her gaze moved sound to Alice who looked like she was stuck between a Jen and an Agatha-place. And like she wanted to be <em>anywhere</em> else.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio was blushing. She must be bright red. Redder than she’d ever been. Jen wouldn’t meet her gaze, only scowling down at the floor. Alice was watching her closely, but her body was still angled towards Agatha.</p><p>And Agatha? Agatha was marching back over, taking Rio’s wrist and tugging her to the armchair in the corner of the room. She half-directed, half-pushed her into it and then stood like a determined bodyguard before her.</p><p>“Delete it all. Now. I want it gone.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Alice said in a much softer tone than Rio had been expecting. “Everyone in this room wants this to work. Jen is-…”</p><p>“Don’t fucking defend your girlfriend. She’s doing this to sabotage-…”</p><p>“Oh, is that right?!”</p><p>Jen had stepped forwards now and before Rio could react she was already in Agatha’s face. Rio jumped for her. She snuck her arms around Agatha and held her flush against her front.</p><p>“We need to know what might come out, what might happen. Because you two losers are so goddamn awful at being subtle that <em>someone</em> is eventually going to notice something. Your fucking face on that goddamn jumbotron, <em>Agatha</em>. You have an Oscar for christsake, fucking act like it!”</p><p>Rio stumbled back a step with Agatha. Agatha didn’t say anything.</p><p>“You may not give a shit about your career right now and I know all of your efforts are focused on keeping Nicky but it’s my job to make sure you have a career to go back to.”</p><p>“I’m not interesting in my fucking career if-…”</p><p>“It’s not just yours, Agatha,” Jen spat. Rio had never seen her so vicious, never seen the fire in her usually calm, often discerning eyes. But her words obviously hit a nerve because Agatha relaxed in her arms as Rio pulled her slowly back again.</p><p>“Besides,” she added, less spit this time. “From even a surface knowledge of playgirl Rio Vidal, she’s not exactly a judge’s dream parental figure. She might get in the way of you even getting <em>joint</em> custody if your bitch of a mother has anything to do with it.”</p><p>It was like Jen had stabbed Rio right through the chest. It was as if she’d pierced through skin and sinew and slashed right through to her already broken heart. Rio gasped, swallowing down air she didn’t know if she wanted anymore.</p><p>Even as Rio couldn’t decide whether breathing was any longer for her, she could feel every breath Agatha took. She could feel the anger ebbing and flowing through her body. The rising tide of her desire to scream, of her need to explode. So she kept her arms securely around her, nudged her way in to press her face in against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha being close was helping. Agatha’s perfume and the feel of her body.</p><p>She took a breath.</p><p>“Mi amor, sit down with me. Come back.” As Agatha began to silently acquiesce, as Rio pulled her down with her into the chair, Jen made the mistake of speaking again.</p><p>“Listen to your mistress.”</p><p>Rio’s back had just hit the seat when Agatha was ripping herself away. She cursed as Agatha made it to Jen and the two best friends were baring their teeth like two Rottweilers in a violent standoff.</p><p>“Say that again, I <em>dare</em> you.”</p><p>“I am keeping you both safe! Look at how much press one fucking kiss with Wanda got!”</p><p>“Agatha.” / “Jen.”</p><p>Rio gave up trying to hold Agatha the way she had been a second ago and instead came around to stand before her, slipping between the two vicious women to find <em>her</em> Agatha again as Alice tugged at her own girlfriend.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw flexed and for a fraction of a second she met Rio’s gaze but the she turned again, ripped herself away once more, and marched a few steps towards the wall, her fingers finding her hair and hiding themselves in it.</p><p>Alice was speaking in a low voice to Jen but all of Rio’s senses were focused on Agatha still. She could see the tension in her tight body, feel the rage emanating from every aspect of her. It made her own body tense, made her own fright fizzle to nothing, taken over by the strain of Agatha’s furious fears.</p><p>She moved closer again and wrapped her arms around Agatha, wanting her to know she was there, that she could rely on her. At least for now.</p><p>At least until anything came out about her past, about her wild child ways. For now she could support her. She had to focus on that.</p><p>“Mi vida,” she tried quietly, watching as Agatha twitched in response but didn’t turn around. But her hand was across Rio’s arm and it felt soft and hesitant as it lay there. “My past it’s…”</p><p>“It’s not about your past, it’s about what Jen is trying to do-…”</p><p>“She’s a megabitch with a huge jealous streak.” Jen had clearly decided to speak up now, making sure Agatha could hear at least this portion of her conversation with Alice.</p><p>Agatha’s hold on her arm tightened but Rio didn’t let it change the way she held Agatha. She was firm, yes. But not unyielding, not unnecessarily trapping her. Agatha had freedom of movement and she hoped that with the knowledge of that she wouldn’t feel the need to pull away again.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to have any kind of profile on Rio. You don’t need to know anything other than she is my girlfriend. That’s it.”</p><p>“It’s the girlfriend part that’s the problem, Agatha! This is a woman who doesn’t date! Who fucks around and-…!”</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>.” Alice.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks were flaming red again, and she slid her arms from around Agatha to turn around and collapse back in the armchair, her head in her hands.</p><p>Perhaps Rio had ruined this before it had even begun.</p><p>“She is <em>my girlfriend</em>. My son <em>loves</em> her and she is more a parent to him, <em>has been</em> more a parent to him in the last few months than Ralph ever has!”</p><p>Rio said nothing. Could think of nothing other than how her presence in Nicky’s life might mean Agatha would have to share her son with her deadbeat husband. No parent would allow that. No good, loving person would allow that to happen.</p><p>“And I am doing my best to make sure nothing fucks this up, <em>Agatha</em>. You know how these things can be twisted. You know how-…!”</p><p>“Jen. Jen.” Alice was intervening again. She could hear her urgent whispering to Jennifer on the other side of the room.</p><p>Rio forced herself to breathe. Forced herself to focus on what she could do: she could step back, she would wait. She could give Agatha time.</p><p>In her sprila, a soft brush against her hair told her that Agatha was closer again. She looked up as Agatha’s fingers skimmed down to caress her cheek and Rio blinked up at the woman who’d softened suddenly, looking suddenly like her Agatha again. Hers and Nicky’s.</p><p>Their soft, gentle Agatha.</p><p>She watched as she took a breath, as her lips parted and her pale cheeks tinged a little pink.</p><p>“¿Etás bien, mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha knew she was spiralling, perhaps even knew the decision that was swirling around in her brain, begging to be made.</p><p><em>Give her time. Step back. Protect Nicky by giving her time.</em></p><p>Her spiral spun its last as Agatha continued to gaze at her, as her eyes held her in place so Rio could lift her head from the depths of her clouded mind. Rio smiled once she surfaced because how could she not. She leant into Agatha’s touch as her fingers slipped down and she held her chin, her thumb just touching her lower lip.</p><p>“Sí, mi vida. Estoy bien.”</p><p>“I’m trying to help,” Jen’s voice filtered into Rio’s consciousness, her gaze still on Agatha as blue eyes moved over her face, taking all of her in, trying to see the lie in Rio’s whisper. She was trying to fix the spiral she didn’t know she’d already halted.</p><p>“She’s right,” Rio said softly. Rio knew she was. Agatha had to know too. It couldn’t be denied that anything anyone dragged up during the divorce, during the custody hearing, could cause a problem for Agatha. <em>Rio</em> could cause problems for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s brow twitched into a light frown and she dropped her gaze to Rio’s lips, raising her thumb tenderly to press into the cushion of her lower one. She didn’t say anything and Rio took her hand away and kissed the fingers that curled around her own.</p><p>She had to think clearly now, had to break the habit that had formed over the weeks of sinking instead of even trying to swim.</p><p>“Knowledge is power and if we have all the information and know what they could uncover or try to hit us with then-…”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Agatha said more firmly than when she’d been checking in on Rio. “You have it. You’ve done the research. You know now. I don’t need to hear it.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze had fallen from Rio and she was pulling away to stand again, raising herself to her full height to look at Jennifer now leaning against the desk with Alice holding her hand in two of her own.</p><p>“We’ll be good. Until everything’s settled and I have full custody. You won’t need the information. And I don’t want it brought up again.”</p><p>Rio took Agatha’s hand, shuffling forwards in the chair to be able to reach it and Agatha didn’t turn but she squeezed her hand when she held it.</p><p>“It’s not enough to do the beforehand Agatha. After you’re out, after you announce your relationship it’ll all-…”</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>Rio stood then, not because she thought Agatha would snap but because this was her part to play.</p><p>“Let them release it all when this is over. Let them interview everyone I’ve ever dated. I’m not ashamed of any of it. And once Agatha has custody they can’t take him away just because her girlfriend has a past.”</p><p>Her voice had faltered over her last sentence, suddenly unsure of herself.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand and Jen nodded just once.</p><p>“It won’t be easy,” Alice warned, the first thing she’d said in a while. Her face was tight, her brow pulled together, her cheeks a little pink. She was scared of Agatha, Rio knew that. But Agatha didn’t bite and Rio never would.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha tugged her hand and Rio looked to her and realised she didn’t want her attention, she was just reminding herself she was there.</p><p>“I’ve only ever wanted this to work. As soon as I knew. As soon as-…” Jen.</p><p>Agatha stiffened beside her, and Rio looked back at her once more, seeing her jaw flex. But her eyes, previously alert again and focused only on Jen were now hidden from her as she stared at the floor. Rio moved her free hand to Agatha’s arm and squeezed her.</p><p>“I’m trying to protect you.”</p><p>Jen’s face was open again, her eyes wide even as she pursed her lips. Rio wondered if she’d ever said anything similar to Agatha before outside of the context of the usual manager/client relationship. Because she didn’t mean professionally. Rio knew that, Alice knew it, and Agatha did too.</p><p>It was why she was looking away, why she was hiding.</p><p>The air in the room was still until Agatha breathed life into it again with her next words: “I know you’re trying your best. I know I haven’t made it easy. But whether it destroys my career or not,” she took a breath and revealed herself again.</p><p>Agatha looked up to Jen and to Rio’s surprise she looked calmer, as if she’d been wrestling with a decision this whole time and she was finally experiencing the peace of making a choice.</p><p>“I choose Rio over my career.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn to Rio, didn’t even look around as she moved her hand to her cheek to try and make her turn. “Mi amor, No llegará a eso.” <em>It won’t come to that.</em></p><p>Rio’s hand was still against Agatha’s cheek, warm and insistent. But Agatha was looking around her, not acquiescing. She had eyes only for her friend. “Which means you can’t just pull shit like this. Everything related to the divorce, to Rio, it goes through me. Through us.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened, her heart choking on its need to beat faster in her chest. She felt the flutter of it, the very moment it forgot itself and tried to canter where it had barely been jogging.</p><p>Her fingers slipped until they were lining Agatha’s jaw and only then did Agatha turn to her. Only then did she look away from Jen. And Rio frowned at the sight. Agatha looked lost, suddenly unsure of what she was doing and where she was.</p><p>So Rio nodded, because it felt like Agatha was looking for permission to be exactly where she found herself. A glimmer of relief flashed across Agatha’s face and then she turned again and Rio slipped back to kiss her shoulder, to go back to being steady by her side.</p><p>“You’re so fucking gay.”</p><p>Jen again. Though with a vague, bemused smile on her face.</p><p>“How no one’s ever seen it, I don’t know. Which is the fucking worry.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and received a scowl from Agatha and soon found that she was pulling away and marching over to Jen. “I’ll accept your apology, Jennifer. When you’re ready to give it. Preferably now.”</p><p>Jen was the one to scoff now and Rio sighed as she went to settle back in the armchair, watching the two friends with interest. The tension was gone now and the two were back to bickering rather than raging so she felt comfortable leaving them to it.</p><p>Her spiral was paused for now, but it was dormant, just waiting to continue spinning again if Rio lost control of it.</p><p>Alice slipped away, still skittish around Agatha. She settled on the arm of Rio’s chair and muttered from the corner of her mouth as across the room Jen was protesting.</p><p>“Girlfriends?”</p><p>“Mmhm.”</p><p>“Feeling better?”</p><p>“Getting there.”</p><p>“Are you ready for what’s to come?”</p><p>“We will be.”</p><p>Alice nodded and both looked across at their girlfriends, raising their brows in tandem as both Agatha and Jen formed fists at their sides.</p><p>“Should we break them up?” Rio asked as Agatha now threw her hands up and stormed around the desk to sit at her chair, soon finding a pen to tap as Jen was spouting words like: “longevity”, “working relationships”, “box office draw”.</p><p>“When she’s riled up I usually have a better change of getting laid.”</p><p>This made Rio bark a laugh and she looked up to her grinning friend. “I’m so glad this little evening has all basically been foreplay for the two of you.”</p><p>Alice shrugged and turned her attention back to the other two. “She seems determined.”</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“Agatha. On the relationship.”</p><p>Rio stiffened slightly, wondering what trust level Alice was currently at with Agatha but knowing it was definitely somewhere still in the fiftieth percentile.</p><p>“You still don’t trust her?”</p><p>Alice’s mouth opened and then closed again but before she could say anything Rio heard her name being called and she turned to see both Agatha and Jen looking at her expectantly. She raised her brows and Agatha repeated: “Can you please tell my manager what we’ve agreed?”</p><p>Rio’s mind ran through the possible answers: <em>I can’t rail Agatha until I start taking care of myself, my cowboy shirt is now our cowboy shirt, purple skittles are now Rio’s to eat so Agatha doesn’t have to, they are two of three ducklings, Rio can’t move in.</em></p><p>The last. It had to be the last.</p><p>“I’m staying here until Saturday but I’m not moving in.”</p><p>“Moving in?” Alice.</p><p>“I really don’t think-…” Jen.</p><p>“We agreed, Jen. Drop it to TMZ on Saturday evening. He’s being served at four. They’ll have it by five past. Rio will be with Nicky and me in the new place. We’ll be hidden away. No one knows where-…” Agatha, agitated.</p><p>“My name on the deed doesn’t mean you’re totally hidden, Agatha.” Jen, again. Angrier.</p><p>“It’s in the hills. It’s <em>secluded</em>.” Agatha, even angrier.</p><p>“Do you <em>know</em> how fucking famous you are?! It’s bad enough you’re a dyke and now you’re moving one in!”</p><p>Agatha was on her feet before Rio was. She’d slammed her hands onto the desk and the slap of it reverberated around the room, settling in Rio’s chest and causing her heart rate to kick up again.</p><p>“Call me that again and I’ll fire your sorry ass before you have a chance to say ‘oh Agatha, what will people say when they see me on Alice’s arm?! Surely I can do better?!’”</p><p>Time with Agatha often felt slower. Felt different to time without her.</p><p>And time now felt slower too. Time felt heavy.</p><p>Rio watched in slow motion as Jennifer Kale launched herself at Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Agatha had thrown herself back and Rio was on her in a second. Just as Alice was on Jen.</p><p>“You fucking lying bitch! I <em>never</em> said that! I never said that!”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t fighting as Rio held her wrists down and pressed her against the shelves behind her desk, but she wasn’t backing down either.</p><p>“You said it, Jen. You told me-…”</p><p>Agatha grunted when Rio shoved her backwards in an attempt to get her to shut up.</p><p>“You bitch. You liar. You fucking-…”</p><p>“ENOUGH!”</p><p>Alice. Little, intimidated, terrified Alice. Agatha was shocked into straightening again where she’d already begun to lean around Rio once more. Rio still wasn’t budging but she turned her head to look at her friend.</p><p>Alice’s cheeks were being held by a panicking Jen and Rio could see the hurt in her eyes, the shock too, that she’d even raised her voice in front of Agatha. But she turned back because as Jen tried to make frantic amends, Agatha was the only person she wanted to turn to.</p><p>“Why did you say it?”</p><p>Agatha flinched at her tone, and looked at Rio properly for the first time since she’d thrown Jen’s words back at her.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Agatha looked like she might deny she’d even said anything. She looked like she might deny even having been in the room when such things were said. But maybe it was Rio’s refusal to look away. Maybe it was her tightening hold on her wrists, the way she pressed her body against Agatha’s to keep her where she was.</p><p>Only something told her Agatha wouldn’t try to push her away.</p><p>A flex in her jaw told her that Agatha was struggling with what to say, with how to manage this. But Rio wouldn’t look or move away. She made her deal, made her struggle, until eventually she said: “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio pressed in briefly before she released her wrists and let go. Agatha’s eyes clouded over and she stepped into Rio, her hands clutching now at her sweatshirt, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio shook her head but had no time to respond because Jen had spoken before she could form the words.</p><p>“Tell her, Agatha. Tell her you’re a liar. <em>Tell her</em>.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t looking at Jen; even as she slammed her hand on the desk. Her eyes were still on Rio, seeking her absolution before she even deigned to look at her angry friend. But Rio couldn’t give what she was looking for because it wasn’t hers to give.</p><p>She shook her head again, barely an inch either way.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Jen insisted.</p><p>“Jen,” Alice tried to calm her.</p><p>“Mi vida,” Rio breathed, her fingers grazing the cheek where a tear now traced its miserable path. Agatha took the cue, like any professional might, and with her hands still twisted in Rio’s sweatshirt she turned to her friend and swallowed.</p><p>“Months ago,” Rio realised as she spoke how afraid she was. Her voice was hoarse and soft and Rio brushed another tear from her cheek, “Jen came to me and said she was nervous about, about being seen with you.”</p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze and Rio laid her hand gently on her chest, a silent request for her to breathe.</p><p>“She was nervous about…”</p><p>Rio pressed her palm a little harder against her chest. <em>Breathe, Agatha</em>.</p><p>“About what people might say, because of your jobs. The… other bit… she never said that.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio couldn’t keep the disappointment out of her voice and Agatha caught it as her eyes moved back to her. She looked devastated and her face began to crumple before her very eyes.</p><p>Rio gathered her in, and felt the first sob against her neck. The hands that had been clutching the front of her sweater were now against her back. Agatha was clinging to her like she was about to disappear.</p><p>If Jen and Alice said anything during that time, Rio didn’t hear it.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if it was the stress of the past few weeks or something else that had set Agatha off. But she’d raged and then she’d disintegrated before her eyes.</p><p>Shame, fury, fear. They were sobbed out against Rio’s willing skin as Agatha continued to clutch at her, not content until she could claw her way in.</p><p>Rio just held on, eventually pressing Agatha back into the shelves so she could feel contained, trapped between the hard wood and Rio’s consenting body. Agatha began to calm soon after, and as her breathing evened, her clawing hands disappeared beneath Rio’s sweatshirt to get to her skin. She clutched her still, her nails scraping and fingers desperate. And Rio held her through it all, ducking her head down to encourage Agatha to look at her, to press her hot, sticky face into her own.</p><p>To become one of sorrow.</p><p>“Rio,” Alice’s voice broke through as Agatha gasped against Rio’s parted lips, nuzzling her broken features as close as she could get.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio moved her arms from around Agatha and placed her hands on her cheeks, keeping her head in place as she kissed her.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio turned her head to an angle that would show she was listening but that meant she didn’t need to turn too far from Agatha.</p><p>“You need to rethink staying here. Both of you do.”</p><p>Rio turned her head back, frowning now as Agatha’s hands began to move across her back, seeking a place to rest. She felt Agatha’s response before she heard it, “No.”</p><p>But she said it only for her. Jen and Alice may as well not have been in the room. But Rio knew they were, so she pulled back, and was gentle as she pried Agatha off of her and managed to turn to the two other women in the room.</p><p>Jen looked as though she, too, had been crying. And Alice didn’t look far off. Perhaps Rio had simply cried too much recently for her body to allow it. But she felt the swell of tears that starts in the throat when Agatha said her name from behind her and tried to turn her back around.</p><p>“We’ll do as we’ve agreed until Saturday. I’ll take Nicky during the day, and bring him to the new house before the press start their hunt. After that, we’ll be careful,” Agatha said her name again, but Rio ignored it, “We’ll be so good and so discreet that even you two won’t notice.”</p><p>She heard Agatha suck in a breath and exhale it shakily as her hands crossed across her bare stomach beneath her sweatshirt. It made her fall back into her, made her falter for a second before she made a promise she didn’t know if she could keep: “We’ll let you manage when we can see each other.”</p><p>It was an overcorrection, a response to the fear that still lingered that she could be the cause of Agatha losing Nicky. Because even sharing him with Ralph was inconceivable. And it being Rio’s fault would be something she simply couldn’t live with.</p><p>“No,” Rio was tugged backwards this time and heard the thud as Agatha fell into the shelves, “No. No. No. We’re not. I’m not.”</p><p>“I think that is the best way to do this,” Alice agreed, her eyes on Rio, who felt the weight of guilt in her stomach as Agatha pressed her fingers there.</p><p>“No. I’m not agreeing. No. I-…”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.” Jen. “You know it’s for the best. For a while, at least. Until we can get a gage on public interest. On press levels, on-…”</p><p>“I will not be told when and where I can see my girlfriend. Only by Rio. <em>Only</em> by Rio.”</p><p>Rio lost her breath then because Agatha had moved her hands. One now had reached to curl around her shoulder and the other was holding her opposite hip. She held her securely against her, as if frightened that this time she wouldn’t disappear, but instead be taken.</p><p>In front of them Jen and Alice looked defeated, and Rio felt sorry for them both. She really did.</p><p>“We’ll do it,” she said, before Jen could utter the words she had looked like she was about to shout. Over her sweatshirt she lay her hands on Agatha’s, letting her know she wasn’t going anywhere. “Because doing it is extra protection for Agatha and for Nicky. And neither of us want anything we do to upset him. He-…” Rio swallowed and felt Agatha tug impossibly at her, “We will do it because we love him.”</p><p>Agatha’s hold changed and Rio knew she was relenting but she wouldn’t say anything to Jen or Alice. Her hand on her shoulder moved to her ribs instead. It rested over her heart and Rio just knew she wanted to feel the beat of it, she wanted a metronome for her own.</p><p>Agatha pressed her face into her shoulder and silence descended again.</p><p>“When you’re feeling ready to apologise, I’ll be waiting for your call.” Jen. Looking less than the anger her words implied.</p><p>Alice had taken her hand and was pulling her towards the door and just as they reached it Rio felt Agatha lift her head up, felt her squeeze over her ribs as she said: “I’m sorry. Alice. Jen. I… thank you. For trying to help.”</p><p>Jen pursed her lips but inclined her head and though Rio didn’t think she’d say anything at all she eventually spoke up: “What I said earlier, everything about… about Rio. You’re right about her. It’s why we’re trying so hard. It’s why I’m being hard on you both. We need to be so careful. Now more than ever.”</p><p>Rio swallowed as Agatha’s hold lessened.</p><p>Jen was looking at her now. Agatha must have spotted it too because she was shifting behind her,   uncomfortable with her friend’s eyes on the woman she’d been clinging to.</p><p>“Agatha’s right. You’re already a better parent to that boy than Ralph ever was.”</p><p>Rio choked on nothing and Agatha brought her hand out from its hidden resting place to wrap around her neck. Her touch was healing.</p><p>She could breathe again.</p><p>“Try to get some sleep. You both look like shit.”</p><p>Alice smiled weakly and Jen offered no other softness and then they were gone.</p><p>The clock on the desk told Rio it was creeping closer to morning and they had to be up in just a few, miserable hours. But she couldn’t think of her tiredness. She could only thing of Agatha who had now moved her hand to hold her head, making her turn around and fighting to keep her as close to her body as possible.</p><p>Agatha was pale, and looked beyond exhaustion. Her blue eyes were downturned, her heavy lids covering them from Rio’s view. Her voice was soft again, feeble.</p><p>“I want you to live with us.”</p><p>“I want that too.”</p><p>“It’s all my fault. Everything is-…”</p><p>“Mi vida, all anyone wants is for you and Nicky to be happy and safe and together. That’s all that matters.”</p><p>“You matter too.”</p><p>“I cannot be the reason he gets taken away. Even sharing him, I-…”</p><p>“I knew you were thinking that. I <em>knew</em> you were thinking that.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily and dropped her head to Agatha’s shoulder, feeling her instantly cradle her close, instantly become the holder of the two of them. The were silent for a while, Rio wading through the waters of her misery and Agatha holding her steady as she passed through them.</p><p>Rio didn’t know who decided it was time they went up to bed. They just did.</p><p>Agatha only left Rio to go check on Nicky and returned to her when she’d seen him sleeping soundly in his bed, thankfully the opposite end of the house to the office.</p><p>Rio was already tucked under the sheets, wearing her underwear and a t-shirt she’d found under the pillow. Agatha joined but didn’t bother with the t-shirt and settled down beside Rio, curling as close as possible.</p><p>They hadn’t spoken, had barely looked at each other since they’d left the office. But Rio couldn’t find the words anymore and Agatha clearly couldn’t either. They’d have to talk another time.</p><p>Rio began to brush her fingers up and down Agatha’s side where she lay facing the same way as Rio, hoping to lull her to sleep first with her soft touch.</p><p>But Agatha found words soon enough.</p><p>“Those other women…,” Agatha’s voice was quiet in the still room, barely above a whisper. “Did any of them have kids?”</p><p>Rio traced her nose along the soft skin of the back of Agatha’s neck, taking a second to try and understand the reasoning behind the question. “Some.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her hold on Rio’s hand tightening, “Did you meet them? Did you ever-…?”</p><p>“Agatha? I never met anyone’s kids. It was mostly just sex. I wasn’t interested in anything more with any of them.”</p><p>In the slowness of Agatha’s response, in the tightness of her hold on her, Rio knew she was worried that Rio had a pattern. That Jen wasn’t right, but was close to being so. Perhaps Rio liked the chase, enjoyed the comfort for a while before she had to bolt and seek something exciting again.</p><p>With her mouth she reassured, she pressed deliberate, open kisses along to column of Agatha’s neck. With her body she cradled, she pressed in closer, holding her more tightly. With her words she calmed, breathing them into Agatha’s ear, “I’ve never found someone I wanted to settle down with. I didn’t even know I was looking until I found you. You’re the only person I want to be with.”</p><p>Agatha pressed back, attempting to turn, so Rio shifted up so she had room. When they locked eyes Rio knew she’d been correct. Agatha was still nervous, still unsure about Rio’s true feelings.</p><p>Her heart sunk in her chest.</p><p>“Life with me and Nicky, when all this is finally over, it’ll be schedules and parent teacher conferences. Making dinner and doctor’s appointments. It’s all boring, all the same, all-…”</p><p>“Exactly what I want.”</p><p>Rio moved again, no longer satisfied leaning over Agatha. She wanted to be <em>all</em> over her, to wrap herself around her, to let her feel her need to be with her. She slid her hand down her side and held her still as she hovered her body weight above her, sinking down to press against her without fully letting go.</p><p>“Does it feel real to you?”</p><p>Agatha asked quietly, having taken a second to respond as Rio was nuzzling against her, her hand slipping below her shirt to feel her warm side.</p><p>“Does what feel real?”</p><p>“This? Us?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio kissed Agatha, partly because she wanted to and partly to see how in her head she was. She kissed back, and her hands flew up her waist.</p><p>“Imagine seeing the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen on a screen in your tiny neighbourhood move theatre and then years later she’s lying beneath you as your girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio kissed her again, and Agatha kissed back again.</p><p>“No, it doesn’t feel real. But it also feels like the most real thing that’s ever happened to me. <em>You</em> are more real than anything or anyone I’ve ever met. And you are all I want.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and Rio felt her heart stammer in her chest as if it had been about to say something but had thought better of it. Only she took over for it, and said the thing she’d been worried about all evening: “Would this be easier if we weren’t together? If we waited?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile disappeared and Rio knew what her answer would be before she gave it.</p><p>“No. None of this. <em>None</em> of it would be easy without you.”</p><p>“I’m thinking of-…”</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking of but I am telling you, and I need you to believe me, that nothing would be easier without you.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze, finding it hard to believe Agatha’s words when she still felt so ineffectual. And after this evening, she felt like a burden.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were tracing the lines of her back now, retracing the journey they’d made earlier when they’d been desperate instead of delicate. Each muscle in her body began to relax until she collapsed fully above Agatha and turned her head on the pillow to nuzzle in against her.</p><p>“I can’t do this without you.”</p><p>Rio nodded but didn’t say anything. Agatha’s hands continued to move against her.</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>“You can’t do this without me.”</p><p>“I love you. I will not allow the press, or Ralph, or my mother, to take you away from me.”</p><p>Rio nodded again and Agatha’s hands stilled against her. Her fingers splayed over her ribs and Rio focused on the warmth of them, the way Agatha held her steadily there as if supporting her body to continue breathing.</p><p>She felt like death was much farther away when Agatha was this close.</p><p>She wondered if Agatha knew her touch helped.</p><p>She wondered if she knew she was keeping her alive.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered, a strange calmness to her voice. “Everything is easier with you too.”</p><p>Rio moved to lean up again, putting an arm’s length of distance between them as she rested her hands either side of Agatha’s face. Agatha’s hands moved once more, her nails dragging down the line to her hips, encouraging goosebumps in their wake.</p><p>Agatha’s face was more relaxed now. And Rio knew Agatha liked access to her so she rolled off but took Agatha’s hand to kiss it like a romantic hero might.</p><p>Agatha was silent, allowing Rio to keep her knuckles pressed to her lips for as long as she wanted. But knuckles turned to a palm and then a wrist and Rio whispered as Agatha made a soft noise of contentment.</p><p>“Goodnight, mi vida.”</p><p>She leant in to kiss Agatha then, lingering for twice as long as before. The hand she’d been holding was now buried in her hair and Rio gasped quietly as Agatha captured her lower lip. She wanted to deepen the kiss. She wanted to turn it into something hungry, build it to something feverish.</p><p>But her bones ached for sleep. So she pulled away to press a a kiss to Agatha’s nose, forehead, cheek. And the she was beside her again. Agatha had turned to press back into her and Rio wrapped her in her arms.</p><p>As Rio settled, as she nuzzled, as she let her body relax, her brain wouldn’t follow it. It turned over the conversation in Agatha’s office. It twisted its neurones around Jen’s desperate need to control a narrative not yet written. It curled around Alice’s desire to protect her girlfriend, and Rio, but also her fear and mistrust of Agatha.</p><p>It secured itself tightly to the reminder of Agatha’s outburst, of the tension in her body, of the way she’d lashed out and went for Jen’s throat when she was in the peak of her rage.</p><p>Rio nudged her nose along the soft skin at the base of Agatha’s neck, she breathed her in for a second, thinking of the way Agatha had broken down against her when she’d felt the shame of what she’d done.</p><p>Jen had once told her: “a feral cat attacks when it’s cornered.” But then she’d corrected herself. “An <em>abused</em> cat.”</p><p>It made Rio feel nauseous as she thought of those words from <em>that</em> night. Of Agatha breaking down then too, but alone, without Rio to hold her.</p><p>Rio made Agatha turn to her then. It was no longer enough to hold her from behind. She wanted Agatha to bury close. She wanted to feel the heat of her breath against her skin. She wanted to hold on to the woman she couldn’t stand to be apart from.</p><p>The woman she now had to leave and see only when her manager deemed it safe enough that she could.</p><p>Sex had been the spark that had lit Rio’s stubborn flame of self-improvement. But fear was the fuel that began the inferno. As she tangled herself in Agatha, as she tucked her under her chin and held her close, she burned with the knowledge that she’d get better, she’d get stronger.</p><p>She’d protect the fuck out of Agatha Harkness and her son.</p>

<p>Agatha didn’t say a word to Rio the whole of the next morning. Or, what little of it they spent together. She wasn’t in the bed by the time Rio woke and when she went downstairs to find her she was already in her office with Jen.</p><p>Alice was waiting in the kitchen.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>“Nothing. Nothing shout-worthy anyway.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat in a “don’t start” way and Alice said, “We should go. She wanted you to stop by before you left. So be quick about it and we can head straight to set.”</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She marched straight to Agatha’s office and didn’t hesitate to knock on the door. Jen opened it, looked Rio up and down in Agatha’s borrowed t-shirt and the shorts she’d found before she left the bedroom, and stepped aside.</p><p>Agatha was at her desk, her glasses on the tip of her nose, her blue eyes tired but bright. She looked up when Rio walked over and made to pull Rio in before she was even close.</p><p>Rio grinned, the bridge of her nose bumping the arm of Agatha’s glasses as she turned into her. The hug was too tight to truly be comfortable but she’d take this over nothing. In fact, she wouldn’t protest if she had the indent of Agatha’s glasses on her face the whole rest of the day.</p><p>“You’re pap fodder, Rio. Did Alice tell you they’re outside your house?”</p><p>Rio broke the hug and turned to Jen.</p><p>“What? No?”</p><p>“They’re curious,” Alice said by the door. “You disappeared off with Agatha and Wanda was caught out for dinner with Jess.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, piecing the two bits of information together as she felt Agatha’s hand brush her side. “We’re going straight to set?”</p><p>“Yeah. Can bundle you in before anyone spots you.”</p><p>Rio nodded again, aware Agatha was now back behind her desk.</p><p>“Starting to feel like stolen goods.”</p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p>“It’s just easier to keep you between here and set.”</p><p>“So,” Rio shifted on the spot, “I can stay here this week?”</p><p>“Well,” Jen sighed as she settled back in the chair the other side of Agatha’s desk. “I’ve just been threatened with being fired and then, <em>very dramatically</em>, being hanged, drawn, and quartered. Whatever that means.”</p><p>Rio smirked and looked around to Agatha who seemed to be busy trying to hide her own smirk as she shuffled around some papers.</p><p>“Babe,” Alice nudged, “Let’s go, come on.”</p><p>Rio swept in to briefly kiss Agatha’s cheek before she turned to follow her friend out, with a slight spring in her step.</p><p>“Your neck is a disaster zone, by the way,” Alice said without looking round to her as she held out her jacket for Rio to take. “She’s a menace.”</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge whether she thought Agatha were a menace or not but she did wrap her scarf securely around her neck to make sure no one else caught the evidence of Agatha’s jealous temper.</p><p>“I really would have liked to have seen Nicky before we left.”</p><p>“It’s five in the morning.”</p><p>“Still.”</p><p>“Relax. You’ll have every evening this week to see him. He was asking for you before bed last night, by the way. Did Agatha tell you? Wanted to stay up until you arrived.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows as she pulled the heavy wooden door shut behind her, watching Alice as she marched along the path with her duffel over her shoulder.</p><p>“Hideous watches, by the way. And I’m buying you a DNA kit for your birthday.”</p><p>Rio jogged a little to catch up. “What? Why?”</p><p>“That kid’s getting more and more like you. He spent thirty minutes talking to me about his new watch his ‘melliza’ bought for him. Drones on and on just like you do.”</p><p>“I don’t drone on and neither does he.”</p><p>“Whatever. The face thing is creepy.”</p><p>“It is <em>not</em> creepy. He just… I don’t know. It’s just a genetic fluke. Maybe Agatha’s got some Puerto Rican in there somewhere.”</p><p>“I could make a dirty joke but honestly I’m too tired. She’s as white as they come and Ralph is practically Aryan. That boy is yours. I’m convinced.”</p><p>They’d reached the car now and Rio rolled her eyes as she slipped into the passenger seat.</p><p>“You think I hid a pregnancy from you?”</p><p>“That or you donated eggs.”</p><p>“Jesus, Alice.”</p><p>“I’m just saying.”</p><p>Rio huffed and pulled the mirror down to check herself over. Jen had been right the night before, she did look like shit. And not only did she look like shit but she also looked like she’d been let loose in a Sorority House judging by the marks on her neck as she pulled the scarf down to check. Makeup and Hair would have their jobs cut out for them but she tried not to think of how embarrassing it would be to expose her neck to the team for now.</p><p>She had other things to think on: learning her sides for the day, knowing her marks, being on her very best and most careful behaviour so as not to draw attention to the fact that her girlfriend was Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Those things <em>and</em> she had to get better. She had to fuel her body and move it too.</p><p>It felt like a lot. But Agatha was worth a lot. She was worth everything.</p><p>Rio didn’t see Agatha again until she was caked in makeup and on set by mid-morning. They were in matching Christmas sweaters and Agatha looked somehow to be glowing. Rio could see her freckles when she was close and she wondered if she even had any makeup on at all.</p><p>Her own makeup artist had done a tolerable job on her but she couldn’t help but think she didn’t glow like Agatha. Maybe the lights would do her a favour. Maybe she could make friends with the Editor and ensure she looked better on camera than she did in real life.</p><p>Maybe she could offer to pay for that CGI facial retouching thing she’d heard some older actresses use.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha whispered to her as they were being prepped for the scene.</p><p>Agatha was about three feet away, someone fluffing her hair, another person down by her ankles, adjusting her socks.</p><p>“I’m admiring.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, motioning a little to the people around her with her head. But Rio ignored the warning.</p><p>“Did you have breakfast?”</p><p>“A bagel.”</p><p>“Will you be having lunch in your trailer again?”</p><p>“I might try a run around the lot.”</p><p>Agatha raised her brows and looked around at her properly, ignoring the assistant now adjusting the sleeves of her sweater.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Mmhm. Gotta get fit.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched and Rio just grinned.</p><p>“Take it steady, hotshot.”</p><p>“Not really my style, Harkness, but I’ll do my best.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed but Rio knew she couldn’t do anything else with people so close. Still, she grinned at her girlfriend, and for a moment enjoyed that Agatha seemed to be struggling with not screaming.</p><p>“Don’t,” she whispered, her jaw tight, “call me that.”</p><p>The people around her moved away when it was called for positions to be taken.</p><p>“Your name?”</p><p>“Are you trying to-…? <em>Don’t</em>.”</p><p>A runner came close and went to adjust Agatha’s collar. Agatha twitched away, smacking his hand as she did.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Rio watched as the fury she’d just sparked in Agatha was taken out on the young try-hard and she grimaced as it was.</p><p>“Sorry, only Frankie said to-…”</p><p>“Then Frankie can do it. Don’t just touch me.”</p><p>Rio shifted on the spot, unable to intervene without embarrassing either one of them. The runner blinked, looked to Rio briefly, then scurried away.</p><p>“Go easy on him. He’s just a kid.”</p><p>“He touched me.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows, looking back to a hard jawline and fierce eyes. “If someone touched you without your consent I’d destroy them.”</p><p>“Mi corazón.”</p><p>“A runner doing his job and touching your collar is different to-…”</p><p>“My husband groping you?”</p><p>Rio blinked but couldn’t find a word to say in response before Frankie appeared and muttered, “Go easy on the runners, Agatha. They’re quite literally run off their feet as it is.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything but when Frankie moved on to adjust Rio’s rolled up sleeves Rio managed to smile at the woman. Inside she felt sick, a sudden panic rising despite the current calm of their surroundings - the kitchen set was decorated for a quaint family Christmas.</p><p>When they were alone again Rio said, “Tell me you’re not doing anything reckless because-…”</p><p>“I’m destroying him for it.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat as quiet was called for on set. Rio stepped an inch to the right and glanced at her mark, a little green t-shape on the ground just inches from the counter, which meant she couldn’t lean against it. Who did this blocking anyway? Her mind was blank suddenly and she looked up in a panic at the script supervisor just as action was called.</p><p>Too late. The scene had started.</p><p>“You’re too soft with him,” Agatha said, easily in character now. Rio turned to her and saw she no longer looked furious, she was instead all of Kate’s exasperation.</p><p>But Rio didn’t know what she was supposed to say.</p><p>So she said nothing.</p><p>“You’re too soft with him,” Agatha repeated, not breaking character but finding a way to give Rio a second.</p><p>“Dani,” Agatha tried again, “You’re too soft with him.”</p><p>“Cut!”</p><p>Rio jolted back to life and turned to see the script supervisor already rushing to her side. Agatha, noticeably to Rio, had not moved closer.</p><p>A cursory glance at the script was all it took for Rio to nod and thank the kindly woman who’d run to her aide. She stepped back and glanced at her mark again.</p><p>Maria was by the camera operator, talking about something Rio couldn’t hear. So Rio took the opportunity to look back around to Agatha and saw her staring at her own mark.</p><p>A flash of anger ran through her at the stubbornness of the woman with her eyes downcast and her shoulders tense. But Agatha looked up again and Rio’s anger dissolved in the sea of Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“Later,” Agatha whispered just as Maria was barking orders for the setup again.</p><p>Rio only nodded, and her fingers twitched in Agatha’s direction but didn’t make contact. Action was called and they were back to being married, back to being Christmas Wives.</p><p>Rio didn’t slip this time. She delivered her lines as best she could and found herself rising to meet Agatha with every utterance. Agatha worked differently to anyone she’d ever worked with before. She embodied Kate fully, letting the humanity of her shine through the memorised words.</p><p>She repeated lines often as if she wanted another shot, wanted to better herself at every turn. And Rio started to do it too, repeating: “Go easier on yourself, mi amor.” She changed it to: “Mi vida” on the second go.</p><p>The scene didn’t require touching but Agatha never did do very well with direction; stage or otherwise. So Rio found her suddenly pressed against her, her face held, their hips flush.</p><p>“Remind me why you married me again?”</p><p>“Your bad temper and need to control everything around you.”</p><p>Agatha, as Kate, rolled her eyes but grinned and Rio couldn’t remember what the stage directions were but she grinned back anyway.</p><p>“I mean it. Tell me.”</p><p>Rio sighed as Dani, but as Rio she tightened her hold on Agatha. “Because I couldn’t not. Because I wanted to be married to the most caring, most unbelievably sexy, lovable, strong, incredible woman I’ve ever met.”</p><p>Agatha, or Kate, rolled her eyes again. Rio wasn’t sure.</p><p>But then something happened that she <em>was</em> sure about.</p><p>Agatha pressed her up against the counter. Agatha kissed her. Completely off-script, completely out of the blue.</p><p>But Rio’s body knew how to respond to Agatha. She kissed her back without thinking about it, she pulled her closer without hesitation, she squeezed her as she let Agatha take the lead. She was Supporting, after all.</p><p>The kiss was chaste but Rio felt like her legs had turned to jelly anyway. Because Kate was kissing her wife but Agatha was kissing her girlfriend. In public. In front of the cameras. In front of at least thirty members of the crew.</p><p>Eventually this kiss would be shown in movie theatres up and down the country.</p><p>This kiss would be seen all around the world.</p><p>They broke the kiss and Agatha, cheeks a little pink, lips pouting, rested her forehead against Rio’s and whispered Kate’s line: “Thank you for marrying me.”</p><p>“Cut!”</p><p>Agatha took a breath and pulled away. Briefly, too briefly, their eyes met and Rio saw a flicker of fear in Agatha’s soft expression. She squeezed her waist and stepped to the side.</p><p>Maria was marching over. “I didn’t want to stop mid-flow but Agatha, can you let me know what you’re planning on doing before you do it. I didn’t have a tight shot prepped for the kiss.”</p><p>Rio kept her gaze on Agatha, wondering why she was avoiding eye contact now.</p><p>“Do we need to get Pepper in? I think we should-…”</p><p>“No,” Rio said so quickly that Maria looked round at her in surprise. “No, it’s totally fine. Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Rio was graced with a glance. It was fleeting, but Rio caught the softness of it, and then it was gone and Agatha was back in work mode, asking Maria why she hadn’t prepped the camera angle.</p><p>Rio bit her tongue as she watched Maria get progressively more and more flustered and was soon marching off back to her monitor.</p><p>“She had the shot,” Agatha huffed without any hint of remorse in her tone. “She just doesn’t like not being in charge.”</p><p>“She’s the director.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Agatha was looking around at her again now but someone had rushed in to touch up her lipstick so Rio couldn’t say what she wanted to say. She settled for a grin that made Agatha roll her eyes and Rio to fall that bit more in love with her stubborn, exacting, arrogant girlfriend.</p><p>They kissed seven more times.</p><p>Kissing Agatha in front of the crew made Rio forget all about Agatha’s promise for revenge. In fact it left her in such a blissed out state that on kiss seven, her hands slipped to Agatha’s ass and she was so content with holding her like that she almost forgot to let go.</p><p>But she did. And she enjoyed very much the pink in Agatha’s cheeks when she stepped back.</p><p>In Agatha’s eyes Rio saw a strange sort of pride and she felt it too. Though her pride was living in her chest, was nestling in, making a home for itself.</p><p>Agatha Harkness just kissed her seven times.</p><p>She could die happily now. Preferably with that engraved on her tombstone so everyone would know.</p><p><em>Here lies Rio Elena Vidal,</em></p><p><em>Girlfriend to Agatha Harkness,</em></p><p><em>Melliza to Nicholas River Harkness,</em></p><p><em>Seven-time recipient of a public, recorded kiss from her girlfriend, and love of her life, Agatha.</em></p><p>Far from being lost in the murky depths of her brain, she was now floating above everything and everyone. But Rio’s job was done for the morning. She was allowed to go.<br/>
Agatha was needed for some additional footage when their scene was in the bag so Rio was free to do as she pleased, though she’d be doing it alone. She said goodbye in as professional a manner as she could when really she wanted to kiss Agatha again in front of everyone.</p><p>But soon she was in her sneakers, forcing air into her screaming lungs, making herself move her body in a way she hadn’t since chasing after Nicky in Boston.</p><p>Her run was slow at first, she kept being stopped by passing crew or cast. But soon she was flying so fast that she couldn’t possibly be stopped, even for a beaming Billy as she went by his trailer.</p><p>The exercise allowed her slow brain to recalibrate. The blood pumping through her veins allowed her to thing of the time before her current state of abject misery. It was as if reminding herself that she was still alive told her brain that the important thing wasn’t that he dad was dead, it was that he’d been alive, that she’d experienced his love, and he’d had hers.</p><p>By the time she got back to her trailer after a loop around the lot, she was exhausted, too warm, bone tired. She said hello to Alice, made a quick call to her mom that turned into a thirty minute boat-load of “mmhms” during which Anna divulged the latest family gossip, and then finally stepped into the shower.</p><p>The water was tepid at first, barely warm enough to tolerate. But by some electric generator miracle it soon warmed until Rio could actually stand beneath it and wash away her sweat, her makeup, her fears.</p><p>Not five minutes after she’d stepped in, a rush of cold air made Rio gasp and whip around in the small space. Her back hit the back of the tiny cubicle and she found herself staring at a very naked, very flushed Agatha Harkness.</p><p>“What’re-?”</p><p>But the question was already answered by the time Agatha stepped inside and closed the door behind her. Rio reached for Agatha before her mind could catch up and pulled her below the stream of warm water.</p><p>“My hair,” Agatha protested, leaning backwards so her head and chest were out of harm’s way.</p><p>“Should have thought of that before you jumped into the smallest shower in the world.”</p><p>“I was more thinking about making sure you were okay after your run.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands began to rub slowly up and down her arms and Rio tilted her head beneath the shower, having no qualms about getting her own hair wet.</p><p>“Oh? Then I’m glad you needed to be naked for that to happen.”</p><p>Agatha hummed quietly and Rio let her gaze fall between them, her thigh casually slipping between Agatha’s legs. The spray of the shower was landing across Agatha’s tits and the sight was mesmerising.</p><p>So much so that Agatha inhaled deeply just to make her chest rise and had to say nothing to encourage Rio as she was already ducking down to taste what was being offered.</p><p>“I don’t have long,” Agatha warned as Rio turned them around, and keeping Agatha out of the water, she pressed her against the side wall, her lips attached to a pert nipple.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned again as Rio positioned her body so her thigh could press up and against Agatha’s core. Her hand was in her hair, holding her fast against her chest and Rio moaned quietly as her tongue swirled around her prize for looking after herself all morning.</p><p>“My love,” Agatha above her was getting breathier by the second, and Rio smiled with her mouth full because of it. She pressed her leg up harder, her hand squeezing Agatha’s other tit, being careful to not slip in the small space.</p><p>“Rio, stop. Stop.”</p><p>Rio grunted as she pulled back and looked up at Agatha with a deep, disapproving frown. “I promise I’ll be quick. Just let me-…”</p><p>But Agatha was pushing her away, leaning back as she forced Rio to the other side of the small space. “No. No touching anymore.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“I mean it.”</p><p>Rio gaped at Agatha, running her hand through her soaked hair to keep it out of her face as Agatha watched her from just inches away, her chest flushed and heaving.</p><p>“You’re not playing fair.”</p><p>Agatha looked as if she were thinking something through, tumbling it over in her mind as she stared across at Rio. The air around them was practically all steam now and Agatha’s cheeks were getting redder by the second but Rio’s gaze had fallen now to the pale hand that had slipped between two pale thighs.</p><p>“No,” Rio protested lamely, “That’s-… that’s my job.”</p><p>“Are you just gonna watch and complain or are you gonna come with me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped back up to Agatha’s face and she first noticed the way her lips were parted, the way the pink of her cheeks was nothing to the pink now trailing across her chest. She slipped her own hand between her thighs and watched Agatha’s gaze drop to it, watched as a soft moan escaped her.</p><p>It may have been performative, but Rio really couldn’t bring herself to care.</p><p>Rio leant back against the wall, and held back her own moans, going slow as she circled her clit with her finger and looked down to Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Play with your tits.”</p><p>Agatha gasped quietly, raising her right hand up to do as she was told and Rio’s hips jerked as she fought with herself not to launch back at Agatha again. Apparently following directions wasn’t Agatha’s strong suit. Unless Rio was giving them.</p><p>Agatha was already closer than Rio could catch up to.</p><p>She was twitching and groaning and Rio didn’t know where to look between the fingers now curled around her breast as she pinched her nipple of the fingers buried deep between her thighs.</p><p>Rio began to work her hand harder against herself but still it was no use because Agatha had come already with a fierce moan and her back arched out from the wall. The view was miraculous, and Rio knew then that Agatha being a quick trigger was more a gift than a curse.</p><p>Once she’d groaned her last, Agatha breathed: “Come here. Let me finish you.”</p><p>Rio stepped through the shower and was on Agatha in a second, her legs spread and her hands either side of her head as she looked between them and focused on Agatha’s tits. She was true to Agatha’s earlier request and didn’t touch her but the sight alone was enough to almost send her over the edge as Agatha’s fingers replaced where her own had been.</p><p>She whined as Agatha lightly brushed over her needy clit, moaned as she slid her fingers further and entered her with two. The intrusion made her rock her hips and gasp as Agatha whispered, “You’re so beautiful when you’re desperate.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open and she gave up on trying to keep it together. Agatha was watching her now, her blue eyes so dark that Rio could almost see her own reflection in them; her own face open and silently pleading.</p><p>Agatha’s thumb found her clit and Rio mewed as her hips began to rock into each touch, her whole body tensing as Agatha leant in to murmur against her ear: “The real reason I can’t let you touch me is that if you did, I’d let you have me. All of me. I’d not be able to make you stop. I wouldn’t want you to stop. You could have every piece of me and I’d want you to.”</p><p>Rio came then, her whole body reacting to Agatha’s tease like it had been tuned to come only when it were confirmed Agatha was hers and soon she could have her whenever she wanted.</p><p>She panted heavily, her forehead resting now against Agatha’s as her girlfriend’s hand moved from between her legs to rest on her hip. She pulled them flush together, their damp, warm bodies now one.</p><p>“You could just… just let me have you. Just let me touch a-and-…”</p><p>“Not until you’re better,” Agatha whispered, leaning up to capture Rio’s lips in a soft, quick kiss. “You’re doing so well. I want you to feel better more than I want you to fuck me.”</p><p>Rio huffed and moved her hands from the wall to cup Agatha’s jaw. “That seems unfair.”</p><p>“I don’t care what you think. That was the last orgasm you’re getting for a while.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and Rio pulled back to scowl at her, “You are being ridiculous.”</p><p>“I am looking after my girlfriend.”</p><p>“No, you are teasing her.”</p><p>Agatha hummed and began to slide out from underneath Rio, already pushing the door to the cubicle open so she could slip outside.</p><p>“Freshen up and I’ll see you on set.”</p><p>“Hey!” Rio grabbed Agatha, making her turn and almost slip. But she held her steady, repositioned her against the wall. The spray from the shower was most definitely flooding the floor now and the cool air made Rio step a little closer.</p><p>“You kissed me on set.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Off script.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“How did it feel?”</p><p>Agatha’s smug face fell into an entirely different expression. She looked torn, as if unsure what to admit to. But it was just them. Just her and Rio and an overspilling shower.</p><p>So she opted for the truth: “I wanted our first kiss on camera to be my choice, not just done because it was in the script.”</p><p>Rio nodded, understanding that completely. Her hands slid down to hold Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“I thought it would be easier but it still feels hard.”</p><p>“¿Qué, mi vida?”</p><p>“Playing pretend.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say anymore. Her brain was still foggy, the endorphins slowly trickling out, her body sagging slightly against Agatha’s. So she didn’t protest or pull Agatha back again when this time she slipped all the way out of the tiny cubicle.</p><p>Rio just let her go, let the door close behind her upon Agatha pushing it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t come back, and she heard her leave the small bathroom in her trailer and she hid beneath the water, trying to calm her frustration underneath the shower.</p><p>Five minutes later, still frustrated, she emerged into the cool air of the bathroom and saw that Agatha had stolen her towel. She shook herself as best she could, padding through the thin layer of water on the ground, and then stepped into the main living space of her trailer to find something to dry herself with. In a small cupboard was another towel so she used that before changing into her underwear and the robe she’d left on the side.</p><p>Agatha had folded her used towel and placed it on the table by the couch.</p><p>She looked at it and then traipsed her way to the wardrobe trailer to fetch her costume and distract herself from the complicated longings she felt deep in her soul.</p><p>Stevie greeted her cheerfully and provided her with her next set of clothes for the scenes to be shot that afternoon. And, with another cup of coffee in her system, and inane chat about a gig Stevie had been to the night before, Rio was soon on her way to hair and makeup.</p><p>Here she found Agatha again, ignoring everyone around her and focusing in on her phone. Rio caught her smiling at her in the mirror but didn’t get a chance to speak with her because she was already being lambasted for getting her hair wet by her designated stylist.</p><p>She apologised, muttered something about slipping in the shower, and fell right back into her brain. Her disappearance into herself lasted through the day, despite her best efforts to fight it.</p><p>Agatha, and Lilia, knew she was struggling, but neither said anything. Agatha just found subtle ways to let her know she was there. She touched her hand whenever she could, she leant around her under the pretence of talking to someone else, she whispered the quietest, “I love you”, Rio had ever heard.</p><p>The scenes that afternoon were of a tense family dinner so her state of mind helped her channel her character’s stress, which worked in her favour overall.</p><p>The only main cast member absent from the scene was little James, which meant the adults had free rein to shoot for the rafters with their performances. The scene was scheduled to be filmed over the next few days, with today mostly B-roll and blocking.</p><p>By the time they were done for the day, Rio was exhausted, and looking forward to a night of quiet in the Harkness household. She’d promised Nicky a sleepover which she hoped would mean she’d mostly get to be horizontal and/or asleep for most of the night.</p><p>With Agatha being close not optional.</p><p>The only thing getting in the way of her and the ability to be sprawled across the couch was her doctor’s appointment. Alice, with Agatha’s help, had booked it for after work and now Rio was rushing to jump into her manager’s car to be driven to the doctor’s office.</p><p>After she’d been kicked off her parents’ plan at the tender age of twenty six, Rio had relied on her SAG membership for Health Insurance. And now, a little older and also earning a little more, she could afford to have more regular check-ups, even the occasional physio appointment.</p><p>Emphasis on the occasional. Getting Rio to go to the Doctor was like getting Agatha to follow the instructions of her Director.</p><p>But this guy was a new guy. He was Agatha’s guy. Highly recommended. Highly sought after. Highly expensive.</p><p>So, as Rio sat in the pristine environs of his office waiting area she felt incredibly out of place in her matching sweatpants and sweater. Alice nudged her leg.</p><p>“Relax.”</p><p>Rio sighed quietly, toying with her fingers.</p><p>“What if he tells me I’m crazy? Or sick? I don’t know which is worse.”</p><p>“Well crazy I think Agatha could handle. But sick? I think she’d burn this city to the ground.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and rocked her head back, staring up at the white ceiling above her. “I mean it. What if I am?”</p><p>“Then,” Alice said slowly, reaching to poke Rio’s arm and force her to look round at her. “We’ll deal with it.”</p><p>Rio nodded, and looked up when the door to the office opened and the doctor stuck his head out. He looked like a TV Doctor might. All tan and white teeth.</p><p>“Rio Vidal? Pleasure. Come on in.”</p><p>Rio shot Alice one last look before she stepped into the office and took a seat in front of the large, intimidating, mahogany desk. Beside her was a view out over Los Angeles and Rio was once again reminded of how far she’d come.</p><p>“So,” the doctor, Doctor Dempsey, started, “I’ve been told you’re suffering from chronic headaches.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “Well, no. Not-… I mean, sometimes. The past couple days I’ve been okay.” She cleared her throat again. “My dad just died and I-…”</p><p>Agatha’s voice came into her mind then: <em>“Rio, will you tell him what you told me last night?”</em></p><p>“I’ve been feeling unlike myself. Kinda slow and, well, miserable and-… sometimes like I don’t want to be here.”</p><p>The doctor was tapping away at something on his computer and Rio wondered if he’d even been listening until he asked: “You’ve been prescribed Xanax before? A see a period of about a year where you were on it.”</p><p>“Yeah, I didn’t like it much. But it helped. Kept me steady when on red carpets and-…,” she was mortified that she was even saying this, “stuff.”</p><p>“Okay,” the Doctor said, his tone now a little gentler, “And physically? Back to the headaches, are you eating well? Sleeping okay? Anything unusual there?”</p><p>“I haven’t been, no. To both. Eating less than I should and struggling to sleep.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>He tapped some more. Rio began to toy with the ends of her hair.</p><p>“If it’s okay with you, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Nothing intrusive, just check your lungs, your heart, blood pressure, that sort of thing. But I think this is more psychological than anything physically being wrong.”</p><p>Rio just nodded and allowed the doctor to carry out all his tests. She was silent throughout them, allowing her breathing to be checked, her arm to be cuffed so her blood pressure could be taken. She was used to being prodded and poked by her teams that this was nothing at all.</p><p>“Okay,” the doctor said again as he went to take his place by his desk. “Nothing seems to be flagging as worrisome with your vitals. I am, however, worried about what you said before: about not wanting to be here.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, “I don’t actually want to die, you understand.”</p><p>“Most people don’t think about not wanting to be alive, Ms Vidal.”</p><p>“Rio is fine.”</p><p>“Rio. Grief can be an intense thing to go through. Incredibly intense. Do you have a support system in place? People to lean on through this?”</p><p>“Yes. A good one.”</p><p>“Okay. In your notes it says nothing about a therapist, are you seeing anyone at the minute?”</p><p>“No, I… I have once, years ago, but no.”</p><p>“Perhaps you should consider it. I can give you some names of colleagues who would be willing to see you, specific grief counsellors.”</p><p>Rio looked down at her hands now back in her lap. Therapy hadn’t been something she’d felt like she’d needed in years. She wasn’t against it, knew the benefits of it, how it had helped her friends. She just hadn’t considered it for this.</p><p>Because losing her dad was the worst thing imaginable and nothing, not even the best grief counsellor in the world, could make that better.</p><p>But Agatha was speaking to someone now. And Rio knew wallowing wouldn’t bring her dad back. Therapy wouldn’t take her further away from him. Getting back to herself wouldn’t mean abandoning him or the love she had for him. Speaking of him, working through how much she missed him, how much she longed to hear him laugh again, it could all only be for the best.</p><p>Besides, he'd want her to live. He'd want her to thrive. He'd want her to be the person she once was. To hold him in her heart and live for the both of them.</p><p>“Okay, yes. That would be good, thank you.”</p><p>“I can prescribe some anti-anxiety meds for you too, but as a first line, I think speaking to a professional will help.”</p><p>Rio nodded, her gaze down on her hands still.</p><p>“I am sorry for your loss, Rio. I wouldn’t usually share but, I lost my own father last year. Grief is a terrible thing and I’m sorry you’re going through it.”</p><p>Rio looked up and saw through the tan and the wide smile. It was all veneer, all gilded reality. This man was suddenly human to her. He was suddenly just a man, a person who’d lost his father and was still breathing despite that fact. He was still living through each day carrying the grief, stepping every day in a world where his father no longer stepped.</p><p>Just like Rio.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said quietly. “I’m sorry for your loss too.”</p><p>Rio left the doctor’s office with an appointment with a therapist who specialised in grief counselling. From a quick google using Alice’s phone - her own was dead - she found that this new doctor came highly recommended too, was a woman, and wasn’t all tan and teeth, which calmed her fears somewhat.</p><p>Alice drove her to Agatha’s, having made sure to pack some clothes for Rio to last her the week. In the car, Rio found Alice was more tense than usual, her words clipped when she did speak but they mostly sat in silence.</p><p>“I’m worried,” she eventually said when they parked a little way away from the house.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It’s just a lot to take on when your dad’s just died and you’re trying to work and-…"</p><p>“I’m not taking it lightly, Alice. I’ve just agreed to see someone about it, haven’t I? And I feel better now we’re together. Now I have Agatha back.”</p><p>“All is forgiven for-…?”</p><p>“We still need to discuss it.”</p><p>Alice didn’t say anything and Rio only turned to kiss her cheek. “Five again tomorrow?”</p><p>“Unfortunately.”</p><p>Rio smiled and slipped from the car, fetching her bags from the back before she made her way to Agatha’s house. She let herself in at the gate and found the door was already open with a grinning little boy standing in it, a basketball in his hands.</p><p>“You’re here!”</p><p>“How did you know already?”</p><p>“Mama said I could watch the monitor.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes affectionally and gave Nicky a one-armed hug as she stepped into the house with him. “Where’s your mom?”</p><p>“Finishing dinner.”</p><p>Rio hummed as she walked through to the kitchen with Nicky and smiled at the sight of Agatha, hair up, glasses on, wearing her shirt. She was trying to kill her.</p><p>“How’d it go?”</p><p>“Good. I told him what you told me to and I have an appointment next week with… another doctor.”</p><p>“Are you sick?”</p><p>Rio looked to Nicky and smiled as she placed her bag down, “No, mellizo, just a little sad.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio smiled as he placed the basketball carefully on the floor and motioned for her to bend down. When she did he held her head in place and whispered, “Will our infinite game before dinner make you feel better?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>Nicky pulled back with a grin and turned to Agatha, “Mama, basketball will make Rio feel better so can we please go play now?”</p><p>Agatha pulled an exasperated face and placed a hand on her cocked hip, brandishing her spatula at Nicky, “What did I tell you about not before dinner? It’s almost ready.”</p><p>“I know but Rio is sad and she just said it’ll help. Please!”</p><p>“Pleaaaaasee!” Rio chimed in, enjoying Agatha’s less than pleased expression.</p><p>“Fine. Ten minutes. But then in and hands washed for dinner. Check those hideous watches to make sure you’re not late, please.”</p><p>Rio laughed as Nicky grumbled: “Not hideous, cool, mama.” And she whisked him and the ball away to the little court at the edge of the garden to make the most of their ten minutes.</p><p>Rio did notice, however, that there were clearly limits to Nicky’s wanting to bend the rules. He kept checking his watch, kept seeing if they’d hit ten minutes yet, and Rio only smiled for it, because the rule-follower that was Agatha’s son had clearly only bent them because he thought she needed him to.</p><p>When he got to the ten minute mark he held his hands up and announced, “We need to go back!”</p><p>Rio didn’t argue. She followed him back inside and was hit but the smell of a fresh lasagne, just now coming straight from the oven.</p><p>“Good boy,” Agatha praised as she placed the hot dish on the counter. Nicky hummed happily as he leant up to wash his hands and Rio took the opportunity to steal a quick kiss from Agatha’s cheek where she stood behind Nicky, focusing on the food.</p><p>“Nice shirt.”</p><p>Agatha ignored this comment in favour of focusing on dishing up and Rio soon followed Nicky’s lead and washed her own hands. She turned as she dried them and was graced with a view of something she could have happily framed.</p><p>Nicky was holding his plate up so Agatha could place salad on it and they were both smiling, both perfectly content. It made her heart grow three sizes in her chest. The pain of before, fizzling down to almost nothing.</p><p>“Now,” Agatha announced as she turned to put salad on the next two plates. “Just this once we’re eating in the den. A special treat for our first official sleepover.”</p><p>Nicky released a “yeeesssss” and fist pumped as Rio ruffled his hair and went to accept her own plate from Agatha.</p><p>“I’m honoured.”</p><p>“You should be, melliza. It’s a special occasion!”</p><p>Rio hummed and Agatha rolled her eyes at her smug smile but soon the three of them were traipsing through, their plates all balanced on trays, to the cosiest room in the house. Inside it the large couch was already laden with blankets and cushions and Rio shot Agatha a questioning look that she didn’t return.</p><p>“Are we sleeping in here tonight?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Can we?! Like in Boston?”</p><p>“No, honey. We all need to sleep in our beds. Your mama is too old to sleep on a couch.”</p><p>“You did in Boston.”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a glare as she sat in the middle of the couch. “Let’s eat first and then we can discuss where we’ll sleep, okay?”</p><p>They all fell into silence, all eating at various paces. Agatha, the most delicate, Nicky, not far off, and Rio, ravenous now, very far from taking it slow or being anything close to delicate. But the food was finished, the trays piled up on the floor, and Rio found herself in her favourite position, her arms around both of her favourite people.</p><p>Nicky had laid half down, his hands clutching Rio’s arm as he leant back against her, and Agatha was in a similar position, though one hand was on Rio’s arm and the other on her knee. Rio wasn’t even sure what they were watching now because she was focused on Nicky’s soft giggles when anything happened on the screen, and Agatha’s gentle touches against her inner wrist.</p><p>Agatha soon shifted, pulling away and wordlessly pulling Rio away from Nicky. She made Rio sit against the edge of the couch, and then sat against Rio, opening her arms to Nicky for him to sit, in turn, against her.</p><p>From this position Rio could hold Agatha properly. She could nuzzle into her hair without Nicky seeing. She could nose against her ear and cheek without being caught. But nuzzling could only last so long when Rio was warm, content, happy.</p><p>She fell asleep before either of the other two and woke only when Agatha was nudging her awake, speaking her name in a soft whisper.</p><p>The room was dark now, darker than it had been before. The screen was off and Rio had no idea what time it was, only that it was late.</p><p>“Honey, come to bed. You fell asleep.”</p><p>Rio grunted as she rubbed at her eyes, “Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>“In bed already.”</p><p>“How long was I out?”</p><p>“A couple hours.”</p><p>Rio nodded stiffly as she sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the couch. It took her a second to make her body move again but soon she was following Agatha up the stairs. They walked to her bedroom and Rio made a beeline for the bed as Agatha prompted her to brush her teeth first.</p><p>She reluctantly did and then threw herself into the bed again, this time wriggling until she was half draped across Agatha and could press her face in against her neck.</p><p>“Tell me about Dempsey.”</p><p>“Mm’who?”</p><p>“The doctor?”</p><p>Rio huffed quietly and rolled over onto her back in the dark room, “He checked me over and said it was most likely psychological, that I should see a grief counsellor. I have an appointment next week.”</p><p>She felt Agatha nod against her, felt her wrap her arm across her middle. “How do you feel about that?”</p><p>Rio’s tired mind whirled with how to explain her complicated feelings about it. But she found the words soon enough: “Guilty that I want to not feel this way anymore, like it’s a betrayal or something. Scared it’ll be too hard to talk about. But I know I need to. I know it’s the right thing to do.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand had moved under her shirt, her fingers now drawing gentle patterns across her skin.</p><p>“I’m proud of you for doing it. For telling the truth.”</p><p>Rio breathed out heavily from her nose, letting her eyes close as she focused on Agatha’s touch.</p><p>“What about your therapy? You said you wanted to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha shifted then, her fingers freezing against her hip. Rio just lay still, listening to her breathing until Agatha spoke again. Her voice was even softer this time.</p><p>“I haven’t mentioned you yet. Or that, that I’m gay. We’ve focused on my mother for the most part. A little on Ralph.”</p><p>Rio nodded into the dark room, feeling her heart hammer in her chest. Agatha kissed her shoulder and then returned her head back against it.</p><p>“I always feel,” Agatha started again, her voice still soft, “raw when I leave. Exposed somehow. Even though I know… That it’ll help.”</p><p>“When is your next session?”</p><p>“Tomorrow.”</p><p>“Well, I’ll be here. You can be raw with me.”</p><p>“Is that an innuendo?”</p><p>“No,” Rio breathed truthfully, turning and leaning down to kiss the top of Agatha’s head. “I’ll be here to wrap you back up and hold you together.”</p><p>Agatha made a quiet noise from the base of her throat then. She shuffled up and kissed Rio’s neck, moving further until she could kiss her lips. “Look at us being all mentally healthy.”</p><p>Rio smiled, held Agatha’s face in the palm of her hand, “I’m proud of you too, you know. I know it can’t be easy. Opening up when you’ve never done it before.”</p><p>Something clouded over in blue eyes and Agatha moved back down again, breaking Rio’s hold on her. “It’s nothing.”</p><p>“It is. From what I know about your mom-…”</p><p>“She’s not my mom. She’s my mother. Birth-giver. Nothing else.”</p><p>Rio nodded to the ceiling. “Well, your mother then. It’s a lot to unpack. A lot of-…”</p><p>“I don’t need your praise, Rio.”</p><p>“I think you do.” Agatha sat up then, turning her back to Rio as she sat beside her. She reached up to pull her hair tie from her hair and let it tumble down her back. “You need to know how brave you’re being for-…”</p><p>“Enough. I don’t need it.”</p><p>Agatha had turned from her, was now laying just inches away but with her back to her. Rio felt as if she were lightyears away, instead of less than an arm’s length.</p><p>“Mi vida.”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Rio reached for Agatha’s side and was relieved when she didn’t push her away. She was quiet for a while, just holding on. When Agatha didn’t say anything else and didn’t protest further Rio shuffled down the bed and curled cautiously around her.</p><p>It was then that Agatha moved.</p><p>She took her hand and cradled it against her chest, letting Rio know she could hold her more closely again. No one said anything for a while, not until Rio had nudged in behind Agatha’s near, until she’d heard her take a long, deep breath.</p><p>“I was never allowed to laugh when I was young. Never allowed to shout or speak unless spoken to. Never allowed an opinion, a preference.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped as her hand was held tighter.</p><p>“I was slapped and denied food if I disobeyed. She had my horse shot because I ran away from home when I was twelve. I got as far as the next house over before they caught me.”</p><p>Rio shifted to hold Agatha closer, feeling heat rise in her body.</p><p>“I married Ralph because he’s an idiot. Ineffectual. A coward. I thought I could control him and get out from under my mother. I could, and I did. When Nicky was born, Ralph asked for a paternity test only, my mother made him, she tried to force my hand. When she saw his hair and his eyes she slapped me for the first time since my wedding day. I was holding Nicky.”</p><p>Rio could feel how tense Agatha was, how tight her body suddenly felt against her own.</p><p>“Nicky spent the first three months of his life alone with me up in the mountains in Oregon. Jen helped me hide, just like she’s going to now. My mother didn’t touch my baby for the first two years of his life.”</p><p>Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand, kissed the back of her neck.</p><p>“I’ve never been good enough. There’s always something she’s managed to find, to point out, to rally against. She says I was born evil and Nicky has inherited my sickness. When she cut his hair, that day I came back, I slapped <em>her</em>. I probably would have killed her if Nicky hadn’t been in the room and Jen hadn’t held me back.”</p><p>“She’ll do everything she can to make the divorce go in Ralph’s favour. In <em>her</em> favour. She’ll try to take my baby away. But I kept her away for years, I can keep her away again. I can keep him safe. With me. With us.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head just an inch, “That’s what I told my therapist.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know what to say or how to respond. All she could focus on was how small Agatha felt in her arms, how quiet her voice was, how she’d turned from her before she’d told her.</p><p>Death was perhaps too kind a fate for Evanora Harkness. After all, death had taken Miguel and Miguel had never raised a hand to his daughter, never denied her anything, never treated her as anything other than beloved.</p><p>Evanora deserved so much worse. She deserved to burn in hell, tortured by images of her daughter living a happy life with her son. Her son who was allowed to laugh and shout and speak and be a normal, happy child.</p><p>She deserved to know that she hadn’t been successful in making Agatha like her, not by any stretch of the imagination. She deserved to know that right now, the person who loved Agatha most in this world - second only to Nicky - was curled around her, silently vowing to destroy Evanora.</p><p>“One of the things I love the most about you is how good a mom you are.”</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha breathed, barely a whisper now. “You don’t have to.”</p><p>Rio ignored her, barely able to contain her love any longer. It burned her insides, usurping the anger she felt, razing it to the ground with its fury.</p><p>“I will do everything I can to keep you and Nicky safe and together.”</p><p>“Just being here is enough.”</p><p>“I mean it, Agatha. Whatever it takes. Whatever you need.”</p><p>Agatha turned then, forcing Rio to move back.</p><p>“And <em>I</em> mean it. You being here is enough. Coming home to you at the end of the day. Seeing you make Nicky smile or getting to sit with you on the couch. That’s all I want. It’s all I need.”</p><p>Rio’s whole body felt boneless. She was suddenly molten lava, suddenly all flesh but no real substance, just fiery, ravenous hatred. But Agatha didn’t seem to notice, she just held her hand on Rio’s cheek, she just smiled at her.</p><p>Rio would raze a million Evanoras to the ground to see that smile.</p><p>“Waiting for me is enough. Being here whilst I get through this is enough. <em>You</em> are enough.”</p><p>Rio gasped out. She’d stopped breathing. She’d stopped breathing and only Agatha could have made her remember how precious breath was. Something unnameable happened then. Something as ancient as time itself. Something took over Rio’s body.</p><p>She began to claw at her, began to clutch and tug until Rio was slipping below the blankets and pressing her whole self against Agatha.</p><p>She couldn’t get close enough. She began to wrestle, dug her nails in, tangled their legs. Agatha just allowed it, clutching Rio as she had a fit of desperation against her.</p><p>It couldn’t be controlled, inexplicable in its suddeness, in her rapaciousness. She had to bury herself in Agatha, had to be stuck to her, had to curl around her, bury in her, protect every inch of her.</p><p>Rio was panting now against Agatha’s neck, crying as she held her open mouth there, her body tense and tightly wound around Agatha’s. Agatha, limp and allowing, was crying silently into her hair. Rio just clung on until she felt the frenzy die. With the pads of her warm fingers she soothed over where she may have been too harsh earlier. With her lips she kissed over Agatha’s warmed chest and neck.</p><p>She stayed like that, trying to smooth over the damage she’d done, trying to love where she’d tried to latch.</p><p>And then she moved up again.</p><p>And then she saw the a sight too devastating to describe.</p><p>Rio choked on her words, “Mi vida.”</p><p>Agatha was still crying, her face screwed up, her lips delicately pouting. She was a soft pink, a watery glow about her. Rio turned her onto her back and hovered close over her, giving her some space to breathe whilst simultaneously letting her know she was there.</p><p>“Mi amor, talk to me.”</p><p>She was too far, there was too much distance. She leant back in and Agatha’s tears became her tears. Agatha’s breath became her breath.</p><p>Slowly, shyly, Agatha’s lips curled around her own. They began to kiss as if tasting the other for the first time. But their first kiss had been frantic, the result of weeks of tension and not being sure.</p><p>And this kiss? This kiss was slow and soft and surer than anything Rio had ever experienced in her almost thirty three years on this earth.</p><p>Earlier she’d been clawing and clutching at Agatha to feel every inch of her. And now she was guiding her through a kiss that healed something in them both.</p><p>When Rio peeled back to catch her breath Agatha tried to chase her, catching her lower lip and whimpering softly as she did.</p><p>When she let go, when Agatha relaxed back into the pillow, her eyes were wide and no longer crying. She was still pink, still watery. But she looked soft again, as though she’d lost herself and found herself again in Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“I’m afraid I’ll lose you.”</p><p>There it was. The simple fear Agatha kept repeating. The fear Rio knew she couldn’t make her forget by simply repeating she never would. The fear her mother had sowed into her from birth.</p><p>“You will never lose me. We will get through this. By Christmas we can be a family. A real one. Not pretend.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes closed and Rio could feel the tension easing in the body beneath her. She settled some more, traced the wet of Agatha’s tears with her thumb. Agatha just breathed through it, her fingers twitching their tender attentions against Rio’s lower back.</p><p>The woman before her looked so much like the Grecian statues so admired the word over. Her pale skin, her strong jaw. Her face was a conversation Rio always wanted to be a part of. It was expressive when it needed to be but silent, stoic when she desired. Her warm cheeks and her perfect nose, she was graced with beauty that was timeless, indescribable. The words for it were lost to modern tongues but Agatha spoke them with every silent look, every flash of mirth in her sea blue eyes, every turn of her head in Rio’s direction.</p><p>Rio could listen to the story of her beauty forever.</p><p>The more she looked, the more she craved. Agatha had been graced with it but Rio was blessed by it. It was a beatitude from a land far away, a time long since forgot.</p><p>Agatha was her blessing.</p><p>“Mi vida, if I thought it would help I’d suggest running away so the three of us could just live a quiet life in the woods.”</p><p>The hairline cracks appeared in the marble of Agatha’s face. She was trying to make herself smaller, trying to hide. But Rio couldn’t allow it, wouldn’t be witness to Agatha shutting herself away.</p><p>“Tell me why you’re afraid.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and said nothing but allowed Rio to press in, to nudge her nose tenderly into her cheek like a cautious puppy might. In the silence Rio’s mind churned over Agatha’s complicated reactions to things, to Rio’s love.</p><p>“You told me,” she whispered now, breathing the words out against Agatha’s temple where she’d just leant in to kiss her, “in Italy, you told me that one day I’d meet the woman I’d want to spend the rest of my life with and she’d be the luckiest woman alive.”</p><p>She moved down, maintaining contact with Agatha’s warm face, tracing her lips and now down until she could kiss Agatha, luxuriating in the feel of her kissing back.</p><p>“I want you to believe that now. To believe that forever. Because I met her years ago in a shitty bar in Chicago. Only it’s me who’s the lucky one. And I’ll work every day to be worthy of you and to make you believe that I want you, I want us, forever.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Forever is what we agreed. You can’t take it back now, okay? You can’t think that I don’t want it.”<br/>
Above her girlfriend, Rio took a deep breath, she felt the air fill her lungs and held it until she was ready to speak again, to spill her truth: “You are strong enough and good enough to protect Nicky through this divorce. And I will be strong enough to protect you both. Te amo, mi vida. Más que vida.”</p><p>After a while of soft kisses and whispered promises, Agatha calmed down enough to fall asleep in Rio’s arms. The two remained asleep until an alarm went off somewhere in the room.</p><p> </p><p><strong>TUESDAY</strong></p><p>Morning brought a renewed strength to the two of them. Agatha, unburdened now with the tales of her past and the therapy she’d been having, and Rio, sure as all shit with what she needed to do.</p><p>Rio was gone again before Nicky woke but that morning, before Alice arrived, they kickstarted a new tradition that would last the rest of the week. They made out, slowly, languidly, all tangled together in the bed. Then against the wall. Then by the front door.</p><p>Rio only peeled away from her girlfriend to open the door for Alice and she only stopped thinking about the prospect of more minutes spent kissing her girlfriend when she had to focus in on her lines.</p><p>Rio mostly spent the day waiting around until she was needed for the the dinner party scene. It was the first time she’d seen Agatha since she’d had her tongue down her throat that morning.</p><p>And visions of pulling her into her lap and really giving the crew something to film filled her brain.</p><p>But she remained professional. She hit her cues, said her lines, managed to not focus entirely on the woman next to her. Plus, about an hour in to filming, James had arrived on set.</p><p>The young, energetic actor made a beeline for Rio and unfortunately for her, she spent the next two hours with him in her lap instead. It took him an hour to calm down and only then did filming get to really resume.</p><p>Agatha helped. She was best at calming him. Something about Rio’s energy riled him up so she was useless at tempering his behaviour.</p><p>When the day was done Agatha managed to grab her for all of two minutes to tell her she’d be late that night due to her filming schedule and her filming later. So Rio agreed to take over from Nicky’s nanny, to get him a healthy (she took this under advisement) dinner, and get him ready for bed.</p><p>She even managed to steal the quickest of quick kisses.</p><p>Her evening was much better than her afternoon. It turned out parenting was easy when your kid was Nicholas River Harkness. All he wanted to do was to play basketball, ask Rio questions she was happy to answer, and eat whatever she gave him.</p><p>And she gave him a reasonably cooked omelette with a side of broccoli.</p><p>He didn’t complain. Especially when the next course was ice cream.</p><p>Even when she called bedtime at eight, he happily went to brush his teeth and change into his pyjamas. His only request was that Rio read to him. So she did.</p><p>And that’s how Agatha found them just after nine, both fast asleep on the bed, both with their faces turned to the side with their left arms flung above them. Rio with an open book about dinosaurs on her stomach.</p><p>Agatha tucked Nicky in and kissed his temple before she went around to softly nudge Rio awake. Rio grumbled some but soon followed Agatha out the room and yawned as she pulled the door to behind her.</p><p>“What time is it?”</p><p>“Time for me to fall asleep on you.”</p><p>“Hmm? How did it go?”</p><p>Agatha was already walking away from her. “I don’t want to talk tonight. I just want to sleep.”</p><p>Rio frowned some as she followed Agatha into her bedroom. She waited for her on the bed as Agatha went to brush her teeth and change into a pair of sleep shorts and Rio’s cowboy shirt.</p><p>“Mi amor? What happened?”</p><p>“I’m tired, Rio. Come to bed.”</p><p>Rio sighed but went to brush her own teeth and came back out soon enough. She simply slipped out of her sweats but kept her sweater on, already not wearing a bra. Agatha was waiting for her in the middle of the bed and the moment she got in Agatha was on top of her already.</p><p>Her familiar weight helped to calm Rio’s worries but she held her close regardless. Agatha said nothing for a while and then: “You were asleep in the same pose. Both with your arms up. Both with your mouths open.”</p><p>“My mouth was not open.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Rio sighed and kissed the top of Agatha’s head. “Do you want to talk about therapy?”</p><p>“Not tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand curled around her collar and Rio felt a flash of anxiety run through her at the simple gesture.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha breathed quietly into Rio’s chest, making the anxiety fan into a flame that engulfed Rio’s entire body. But she whispered it back.</p><p>Agatha fell asleep. Rio did too, a long time after, her head to the side, her mouth open.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p><p>The day started how days now would. After they were both minty fresh, they piled back into the bed and lost themselves in each other’s mouths. Rio had Agatha up against the door again when Alice knocked.</p><p>This time she’d made it as far as her hands beneath Agatha’s shirt, but for the most part it was chaste. They hadn’t even reached second base.</p><p>And Wednesday went much like Tuesday had. Only Rio squeezed in a run before she had to be on set. And found that the exercise helped with her anxiety more than ever.</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t spoken to her about what had happened in Therapy.</p><p>James was there again, for a longer period, on and off, because he was still little. But he was with Rio mostly, with her at the table. By her side, in her lap, shouting in her ear between takes.</p><p>Agatha did all she could to help.</p><p>But Rio couldn’t help but be reminded of how different this kid was to Nicky. How much she had enjoyed spending the evening one on one with Agatha’s son.</p><p>She didn’t get a chance to talk to Agatha about her desire to remain silent about therapy the night before but she remained so distracted all day by little James and Agatha’s constant, secret touches, that she almost didn’t worry about it at all.</p><p>By the time it was evening again and Rio arrived at Agatha’s house only five minutes after Agatha, the worries were back.</p><p>She played with Nicky until it was time for dinner - a much more delicious pasta compared with the omelette from the previous night. And then it was time to crash on the couch. Only this time Agatha had calls to take in her office.</p><p>So only dos patitos watched <em>101 Dalmations</em>.</p><p>“She’s a bit like grandmother.”</p><p>Rio raised her brows and turned to Nicky in surprise. “Cruella?”</p><p>Nicky looked shy suddenly, like he shouldn’t have said it.</p><p>“A little.”</p><p>Rio hummed, trying to think of a way to not call Evanora a raging bitch who she could totally see would skin puppies. She couldn’t think of anything so said nothing. Soon Nicky had made his way over to her and she instead tucked him under her arm, only hoping he knew that he’d be safe from any Cruellas with her.</p><p>That night Agatha didn’t want to talk about therapy again. They made out and Rio hit second base and she stayed there until they fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p><p>By morning, Rio felt like she was a teenager again.</p><p>She barely spent the requisite two minutes brushing her teeth and instead did a cursory once over, just to be polite, before she had Agatha up on the counter, both still holding their toothbrushes.</p><p>It had been years since she’d spent this much time kissing. It felt like relearning an old skill, getting back in touch with an old friend you forgot was such good company.</p><p>And Agatha was the best partner to practice with. They both dropped their toothbrushes in the sink with a clatter and Rio was now able to free roam her hands beneath Agatha’s shirt as Agatha wrapped her legs securely around her waist.</p><p>It was the R-rated version of the scene they’d shot three days ago. Only the roles were reversed and no man was standing in the corner eating a sandwich.</p><p>Agatha moaned readily, arched up desperately, kissed hungrily. And Rio had never been more turned on in her life. She began to fantasise as she rolled two perfect nipples between her fingers of fucking Agatha in this exact position when she was better again.</p><p>She thought of bending her over the sink, pulling her hair back until she was forced to watch herself take everything Rio would give her.</p><p>She had to rip herself away, panting and soaked through her underwear because she could no longer stand those fantasies not being a reality.</p><p>Agatha was panting too, the flush of her cheeks matching the flush across her neck. Her lips were swollen, her pout unaffected, simply the natural effect of making out solidly for twenty minutes.</p><p>“We should slow down,” Agatha said between soft breaths, “I-… I need to slow down.”</p><p>Rio could barely stand to hear it, unable to <em>not</em> think about what Agatha’s underwear might feel like if she reached to touch her.</p><p>“Yes. Me too. Me too.”</p><p>She placed her hands either side of Agatha’s hips and dropped her head to her chest, taking slow, deep breaths to try and calm her racing heart.</p><p>“How, my love, how are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I need to touch you. Properly.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha choked the word, gulping audibly as she scratched at Rio’s scalp from where she was perched above her. “I mean, within yourself?”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, trying to make her mind focus on an answer rather than her ability to see Agatha’s nipples through the thing fabric of her shirt.</p><p>“More myself, I think. Less… I don’t know, murky.”</p><p>Agatha moved her hands down to hold Rio’s face up and smiled softly, and Rio saw her large her pupils still her, how warm her aplomb felt against her skin.</p><p>“Good. Will you call your mom today? Alice said-…”</p><p>Rio huffed, nothing like the mention of Alice interfering and her mom to kill her boner. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha repeated, finishing her word with a kiss to Rio’s nose. “And tell her I send my best.”</p><p>“I’ll tell her you’re withholding sex.”</p><p>“Please don’t.”</p><p>Rio huffed again but Agatha was pushing her back now, sliding down onto the ground again.</p><p>“Alice will be here soon.”</p><p>Their decision to go slower didn’t last very long. By the time they were waiting for Alice’s arrival, they were making out again, Rio’s hands now comfortably holding Agatha’s waist and Agatha’s hands now tangled in Rio’s hair.</p><p>But Alice arrived and their day began properly.</p><p>Turns out the best part of Rio’s day had been the time when she thought she was going to die from not being inside Agatha, or at least touching her below the waist.</p><p>James was a pain in the ass again, clinging and jumping and shouting. Even Agatha couldn’t tame him and their only respite was when he was taken off set due to the god sent miracle of child labour laws.</p><p>But their dinner party scene was a complicated one, with lots of moving parts, lots of food, forks, and fraught energy between the characters. The one win for her day was that Rio could keep her hand on Agatha’s thigh, they were married after all.</p><p>Rio did call her mom though, on her way to Agatha’s in the car with Alice. Her mom was as pleased as she always was to hear from her, and this time they discussed the family for only five minutes and spent another ten talking about Miguel.</p><p>It was nice. It felt easier than she thought it might.</p><p>By the time evening came around Rio was mentally exhausted but physically she had enough energy to play ball with Nicky, creeping ever closer to infinity.</p><p>At dinner they ate at the table, an unfussy chicken salad, accompanied by well-deserved wine for Agatha and Rio, and a milkshake for Nicky. Agatha again had to hole up herself in the office and Rio took it upon herself to take Nicky in to say goodnight, to get him ready for bed, to read with him, and again to fall asleep beside him.</p><p>Agatha came to fetch her as she had before and in leaving, Rio saw on her watch that it was midnight. She sighed as she placed it down on the side, worried for Agatha’s late night and secretive hours spent in her office.</p><p>“How is everything going?”</p><p>“Mm? Fine.”</p><p>“How are you feeling about Saturday?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“You don’t want to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head against the pillow and Rio tried: “What you said about Ralph the other day, about destroying him because-…”</p><p>“I’d have destroyed him either way. I’ll just take more pleasure out of it because of what he did to you.”</p><p>Rio smiled sadly, deciding to let the topic lie and instead changing it: “I was thinking of taking Nicky to the park? There’s a small one off Riverside. I think we’d be secluded enough that-…”</p><p>“I trust you with him. I know you’ll keep him safe.”</p><p>Rio dropped her gaze and focused in on Agatha’s lips, “Will you be okay all day? Just you and your lawyers?”</p><p>“Jen’s insisting on being close by. I’ll be fine. I’ll be in the new house by early evening.”</p><p>“And I can stay?” Rio’s eyes darted back up, appealing to Agatha’s desire to have her close. “Please?”</p><p>“If they find us, Rio. If they find us, it won’t be a few paps sitting outside your house. It’ll be every paper and online publication the world over with vans and-…”</p><p>“But I can be there to help. To help with Nicky when-…”</p><p>“I’ve hired security, remember? They’ll be there on Sunday. We’ll stay hidden until Nicky has school, until work. You won’t need to worry.”</p><p>Rio shifted in the bed, tugging Agatha that much closer. “You know I will.”</p><p>“I’m telling you you don’t need to.”</p><p>“Look at Boston. Look at what happened there. You were swarmed and no one was around to help. That guy didn’t even turn up.”</p><p>“My love,” Agatha whispered, softening when Rio was beginning to show signs of panic. “I promise you we’ll be safe.”</p><p>“You only feel safe with me.”</p><p>“We’re tres patitos,” Agatha murmured, and attempt to soothe, now brushing her fingers delicately through Rio’s hair as Rio fought the shiver that threatened her body as her adrenaline kicked in.</p><p>“We can only be safe when all of us are safe. I want you safe, in your house, away from the circus.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and Agatha smiled sadly, “Please. Just this once. Just one night. I’ll call you all day Sunday, let you know we’re fine.”</p><p>Rio shivered, Agatha changed her hold on her, rolling them over until she was above her. She began to kiss over her face, and Rio clung to her as she felt the first of Agatha’s tears. But neither of them said anything and soon Agatha’s kisses had settled against her throat, soft and tender.</p><p>Rio fell asleep first this time. Her body shivered as she slept and Agatha tried to keep her warm but knew it was nothing to do with heat.</p><p> </p><p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p><p>On Friday both Agatha and Rio slept in. At least, they only woke up when Alice called Agatha and her cell vibrated obnoxiously on the bedside table.</p><p>In the hurry for Rio to leave, they missed their typical makeup session but Agatha managed to kiss Rio goodbye, to hold her close before she inevitably had to let go.</p><p>Rio hadn’t been in trouble with Alice, which was weird. Alice had instead seemed a little more tense and explained only when they were halfway to the set.</p><p>“Jen and I aren’t speaking.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“We had a fight about you two.”</p><p>Rio raised her browns and decided turning to focus on the road was a better idea than staring at her friend’s tense side-profile.</p><p>“Let me guess,” Rio said bitterly, “she thinks I’m going to fuck Agatha over.”</p><p>“No,” Alice said with a scoff, “she thinks Agatha’s going to fuck herself.”</p><p>Rio turned back then and raised her brows once more, “What does that-…?”</p><p>Alice sighed and flipped someone off who tried to overtake too close. “She thinks she’s not thinking straight and is more focused on you than-…”</p><p>“Agatha is putting Nicky first. We’ve discussed it. Everything is about keeping custody of Nicky.”</p><p>Alice just shook her head and after a second muttered, “I told her that. She’s just worried and I… I’m being stubborn.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Imagine all Agatha spoke about was Jen.”</p><p>Rio shook her head and sighed, looking down her her hands in her lap. “Alice, it’ll be hard for a while but-…”</p><p>“I want to propose but I’m putting it off because… well because of all this shit.”</p><p>Rio, a person who once had been privy to all of Alice’s decisions before she’d even considered them decisions, was taken aback by this. And, if she could admit it to herself, a little hurt.</p><p>“Have you bought a ring?”</p><p>“Not yet, I have been saving and-…”</p><p>“Do you need a salary increase? I can-…”</p><p>“Jesus, Rio. No. Listen to me. I’m saving, I have the cash, I just want to go with my best friend to a store and not have the world looking or following or-…” She sighed heavily, and Rio saw in Alice for the first time something that she’d been missing for weeks.</p><p>Alice was as broken as she was.</p><p>She reached for her friend and wrapped her fingers around her wrist. “I’m going to have my mom come visit soon. Will you stay with us?”</p><p>Alice’s tense little body relaxed an inch or two and her eyes softened, moving from the road briefly to meet Rio’s gaze. She nodded, her lips twitching into the affirmative but not making any sound.</p><p>Rio held her for the rest of the drive.</p><p>When they stopped she said, “Jen’s a lucky lady, you know.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Rio was shoved away and the gentle comfort that had settled in the little car dissolved as Alice began to bully Rio out of the door, making her bark her laughter and nearby crew all turn to see.</p><p>The day got better from there. Rio and Alice found a way to behave like normal friends might and neither of them bought up Agatha or Jen. Neither of them brought up how much they missed Miguel.</p><p>Filming went as smoothly as it could have gone that day. James kept making appearances between his tutoring and down time. Rio was “mama Rio” and was soon partially deaf in one ear because of that fact.</p><p>But Agatha was close, Agatha was her wife for the day. Pretend or not, it was nice to call her that.</p><p>By the time evening rolled around Rio was feeling less than the tired she’d felt the night before. Nicky wanted to play basketball so they played until dinner and then played some more after.</p><p>Agatha had calls to make anyway.</p><p>Rio was the new favourite to help with the bedtime routine and Nicky always removed his toys from her side before she could get comfortable and Rio always pretended not to notice because Nicky seemed to feel shy about even having toys in the first place.</p><p>One in particular looked very loved and Nicky always placed it on his shelf and patted its head before he scrambled back to the bed. The book on dinosaurs was finished now but Nicky liked reading about the Diplodocus with his long neck so they read that chapter again and Rio was just about to say goodnight - determined not to fall asleep again - when Agatha popped her head around the door.</p><p>“Both still awake?”</p><p>Rio hummed as she placed the book on the side and then grunted when Nicky threw his covers and himself over her.</p><p>“Sleeping, actually.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at all like she believed her son but she said nothing and instead sat on the bed by Rio’s thigh and placed her hand on his back. “Rio, can we have a sec?”</p><p>“If I can get this little duckling off me then yes.”</p><p>Nicky giggled and rolled off and rubbed at his tired eyes as he said, “Mm’g’night, Rio. Buenas noches.”</p><p>“Buenas noches, mellizo.”</p><p>Rio kissed his cheek, shot Agatha a quick smile and then slipped from the room to give the mother and son some space.</p><p>By the time Agatha returned to her room, Rio was tucked in the middle of the bed, waiting patiently for her to join. Agatha only smiled and slipped beneath the duvet to curl into Rio’s arms.</p><p>“You’re keeping him up too late.”</p><p>“Umm, do you know how cool dinosaurs are?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and rolled her eyes, “Yes, we’ve been reading that same book since he was six. I’m pretty sure he can recite the damn thing.”</p><p>“Well, I’ve only read it once now and I think-…”</p><p>Agatha hummed and interrupted Rio’s words by kissing her. “I think you should sleep.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio mumbled, “I’ll dream of dinosaurs. A land before time.”</p><p>“Dream of speeding up time, so we can do this <em>all the time</em>.”</p><p>“Argue about dinosaurs?”</p><p>“No, be together.”</p><p>Rio smiled and shuffled down so they could be face to face. She went to say something, something loving, something patient, something kind, but found words failed her as she drowned in deep blue.</p><p>When they fell asleep, they both dreamed of a time where they could read about dinosaurs every night and fall asleep, just like this, in each others arms.</p><p> </p><p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p><p>As if to make up for the fact that they’d barely kissed the day before, not five minutes after waking and barely bothering to brush her teeth, Rio was back on top of Agatha, pressing her up against the bathroom wall.</p><p>She’d decide the countertop was too dangerous.</p><p>But Agatha’s wrists were being held up against the wall so firmly that she’d dropped her toothbrush and it now lay destined for the trash by their feet.</p><p>The kiss today was furious, more feverish than it had been all week. Which meant it was dangerous too. Rio knew she wouldn’t be seeing Agatha until later and even then she wouldn’t have time alone with her. So she tried to put all she could into the kiss, trying to let Agatha know she was already feeling stronger, already healthier, already ready to protect her and her son.</p><p>Agatha moaned into Rio’s mouth as she arched against her and Rio soon introduced teeth where she’d previously only been using lips and tongue. It made Agatha protest, made her tug until Rio relented and she could use her hands to push Rio away.</p><p>She felt feral, like a rabid dog denied its treat.</p><p>All she wanted was Agatha, and yet, Agatha was everything she couldn’t have.</p><p>“No. Not-… not yet. Not today. I need… I have to think straight.”</p><p>Rio turned from her, running hers fingers through her hair and taking in a big, hopefully soothing breath. And then Agatha’s hands were sliding across her front, she was holding her the way she had when she’d held her for the first time.</p><p>On a jet ski in the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>Her body reacted now how it had reacted then: she was on fire.</p><p>Agatha kissed along her neck until she pressed her face in against her shoulder and Rio held over her hands and looked at the two of them in the mirror.</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Can you wear your shirt today? I’ll need it tonight.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, unable to see the sight before her anymore when she knew she’d need to leave Agatha and Nicky all alone, at the mercy of the world’s media.</p><p>“Mi vida.”</p><p>“Please, just, say you’ll wear it.”</p><p>Rio nodded and sighed out as Agatha moved slowly around her, finding her lips again in a soft kiss.</p><p>“I should go get Nicky up. I need to be at the lawyer’s office early. Will you have him up at the house by four? You have the address?”</p><p>Rio nodded, her eyes still closed until Agatha nudged their noses together and she fluttered her lashes until they were open, knowing what Agatha had been silently asking.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio whispered, watching the way Agatha’s sea blue eyes seemed to swirl with unshed emotion. “I can’t wait to start our lives together.”</p><p>Agatha’s face, carved from marble, was warm to the touch. Her cheeks were flushed still, her eyes soft, “Tell me one more time. Please. I need to hear you say it.”</p><p>“Para siempre, mi corazón. Te amo.” <em>Forever, my heart. I love you.</em></p><p>Agatha’s head ducked in the briefest of nods and then she kissed Rio again and against her lips she promised: “Forever. I love you too.”</p><p>It was hard to leave the little bathroom after that. But Agatha needed to say goodbye to Nicky and they both needed to start their days.</p><p>Down the stairs, both of them now dressed, Agatha in a casual yet smart pantsuit, and Rio in jeans and her shirt, they fussed around Nicky, making sure he was as happy as he could be.</p><p>Agatha told him to be good for Rio but Rio really didn’t think there was any other way he could be for her. She told him she’d packed a bag for him of all his most precious things and that she’d see him later that evening in their new house. She told him to do everything Rio said and to not leave her side.</p><p>She told him she loved him more than anything and would see him soon. And then she hugged him and Rio had to look away for fear she’d be unable to hide the emotion in her face.</p><p>But Agatha was soon hugging her and Rio sighed out, forgetting herself briefly and pressing her lips for too long against her cheek. But Agatha didn’t pull away. She held her close and only stepped back when Rio loosened her hold first.</p><p>They made eye contact and though they didn’t say it, Rio knew Agatha felt it. She loved her beyond words.</p><p>Her thumb had been rubbing over and over Agatha’s fingers of her right hand, holding them loosely, reluctant to let go but not brave enough to cling on. She looked down at the motion and held Agatha’s hand between them as her thumb found a new ring on Agatha’s finger.</p><p>“I can’t wear the diamond,” Agatha said softly, knowing Rio’s question before she asked it. “This is the wedding band. Only on my right hand because-…”</p><p>“Because it’s a pretend one but only for now.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once and Rio looked up and smiled sadly, unable to stop herself from pulling Agatha back in for a tight hug. She was crinkling her suit but that didn’t matter. Holding her close was more important that proof she owned an iron - or her housekeeper did.</p><p>But Rio had to let Agatha go.</p><p>And Agatha left with her own bag of precious things after kissing Nicky one last time and then it was just them, dos patitos, and the whole day ahead of them. Rio had already fixed her face into a smile and moved around to steal one of Nicky’s toast soldiers from his plate by the time the door closed on Agatha.</p><p>“So. I was thinking… we spend all day in the park, we come back here, we grab your bag, head out for burgers, then head to the new house? How does that sound?”</p><p>Rio had never seen Nicky so happy. So happy, in fact, that she was able to steal another soldier.</p><p>“Yes!! Yes that sounds like the best plan ever!”</p><p>Rio laughed, biting into the soldier like an old King might his turkey leg. “Excellent because I’d have been very upset if you’d have said no to basketball and burgers.”</p><p>“Can we get milkshakes too?”</p><p>“And ice cream.”</p><p>It was quite difficult to make Nicky eat the rest of his breakfast before it got cold then. The rapid fire questions that came Rio’s way made her pour herself a larger coffee, for fear he’d tired her out before they even got to the park.</p><p>But somehow, they made it.</p><p>Rio had kept true to her word and kept her shirt on for Agatha, hoping she wouldn’t get too sweaty in it and secretly hoping even then Agatha wouldn’t mind. Or maybe that she’d prefer it.</p><p>Nicky had opted for his Celtics jersey, or, more accurately, Rio’s old Celtics jersey. The one that was too big for him. The one that he basically hadn’t taken off since he’d borrowed it from Rio the first time they met.</p><p>But Rio insisted he also wore a sweater. She did, however, allow him to have it partially open so people could see the green of his jersey. Though she neglected to point out that people could already see the bottom of it sticking below the hem of the sweater, as big as it was.</p><p>As a finishing touch, he also put on Rio’s Celtics hat, just to really show the world who his favourite team was.</p><p>In the meantime, Rio had packed a bag full of snacks and water and grabbed a basketball from outside.</p><p>So, making sure to lock the door and then the gate behind them, Rio and her little mellizo, stepped out into the sunshine hand in hand, with Nicky still chatting away happily and Rio still answering as best she could.</p><p>Everything changed as soon as they were in the car.</p><p>Rio had helped to strap Nicky in, not because she thought he couldn’t do it himself but because she wanted to make sure Agatha’s son was as safe as safe could be.</p><p>But that was when she realised that her little hybrid wasn’t the safest place for him.</p><p>Agatha had been right all those weeks ago. Her car was too small, too unsafe.</p><p>She felt sick suddenly.</p><p>Fuck fuck fuck, Rio thought the moment she’d started the engine of her little hybrid. This car was a death trap. It was so small and so obviously not suitable to transport her precious cargo anywhere.</p><p>She was going to kill Agatha’s son.</p><p>She broke out into a cold sweat as Nicky swung his legs and continued to talk about basketball.</p><p>Managing to respond but not really thinking about anything other than what an idiot she was for sending back Agatha’s gift of a big, sturdy, admittedly garish, car, she kept her focus on the road.</p><p>Clearly her responses weren’t good enough.</p><p>“What’s wrong, melliza?”</p><p>“Oh. Um. Nothing. I’m just… just trying to get us there safely.”</p><p>“Am I talking too much?”</p><p>“No, baby. Never. Sorry. I. Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s okay, we can be quiet.”</p><p>Rio chewed on her lip and kept her eyes on the road. She was a good driver, always had been. She was conscientious and deliberate. Her reactions were fast and she never went too fast or too slow.</p><p>There was no reason to think she’d crash when she never had before. She’d not so much as dented her car.</p><p>She took a breath and quietly asked: “Are you excited about the park?”</p><p>Nicky turned to her and grinned and for the first time Rio, briefly, took her eyes off the road. His smile relaxed her.</p><p>“Yes! We have so far to go to hit infinity.”</p><p>Rio nodded and forced herself to relax. Nicky was safe with her. She was a good driver. She would keep him safe. He would be returned to Agatha in one piece.</p><p>She’d promised Agatha she’d keep her son safe. She kept her promises.</p><p>Nicky was soon spouting off again, the shy little boy he was in company completely missing now he was on a roll with his favourite person. Even Rio’s softer responses, the way she wouldn’t look at him and kept her eyes on the road, didn’t seem to phase him.</p><p>He was simply happy to be there.</p><p>And Rio would only be happy once she’d trashed this damn car and bought a new one. A big one. An expensive, full of mod-cons, gas-guzzler that would keep Nicky safe. She could think of nothing else until they were parked up safely and Agatha’s son was back on solid ground.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help it when she checked him over briefly, wondering if she’d taken the last few corners too sharply and without knowing it had thrown Nicky about when actually he’d been very secure in his seat.</p><p>Nicky blinked up at her, allowing the check with a shy smile.</p><p>“You okay, melliza? You look upset.”</p><p>“I’m okay. I’m just… just making sure you’re okay.”</p><p>Nicky frowned as his smile faded, his eyes scanning over Rio’s face for a while before he said: “Melliza? What’s wrong?”</p><p>Rio bit down in her lip and paused where she’d been adjusting Nicky’s zipper on his sweater, tugging it up a little to protect from the cold and then down again so he didn’t overheat.</p><p>“I just want to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>Nicky placed his hand over her own and made her stop. “Mama said you might worry.”</p><p>“She did?”</p><p>“Well, she told me last night,” Nicky shifted on the spot, “but I wasn’t supposed to tell you that.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched a little, “I won’t tell her you did.”</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky said softly, “only she said you might worry a little today and I was to be on my best behaviour for you so you don’t worry too much.”</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>Nicky was getting into it now, nodding his head enthusiastically as he said: “Yes and she said that I was to tell you that we are dos patitos today and we will have the best time and that I feel safe with you. Safe and happy.” He frowned as Rio smiled, “Seguro y feliz.”</p><p>He grinned when he remembered the words Agatha had taught him and Rio grinned right back at him, her heart rate hammering in her chest now for different reasons.</p><p>“Okay, mellizo. I guess if your mama says so then we will have the best time.”</p><p>“She is very smart.”</p><p>“Very smart.”</p><p>Nicky rocked up onto the balls of his feet and Rio straightened, taking his hand as she did.</p><p>Rio marched them away towards the empty basketball court and sat them both down on the mini bleachers set up to the side. The space around them was quiet, the sun was getting higher in the sky, though the air was cooler than usual for mid-March.</p><p>With her free hand she began to rummage in the tote bag for the cereal bars she’d packed earlier and when she found them she turned to pass one to Nicky and saw him measuring up his hand against Rio’s palm.</p><p>“One day your hand will be much bigger than mine.”</p><p>Nicky grinned up at her and filled the spaces between Rio’s fingers with his own, “But you’ll still hold my hand?”</p><p>“Oh I don’t think you’ll want me to.”</p><p>“No I always will! It’s soft and warm and it’s nice.”</p><p>Rio hummed and motioned for Nicky to take the offered bar. “For energy. We have a lot of points to get to infinity.”</p><p>Nicky decided holding her hand could wait in exchange for having enough energy to reach infinity. Rio smiled as he tucked into it and turned her gaze to the quiet surroundings, taking a bite of her own bar.</p><p>They ate in silence for two bites worth of the surprisingly delicious peanut butter flavoured bar until Nicky said something that was equally as surprising.</p><p>“My mama told me something else, melliza. Well, I told her something, I <em>asked</em> her something and she said that… she said I should tell you I love you.”</p><p>Rio almost choked.</p><p>Nicky patted her back in a manner that wouldn’t have made any difference at all if she had.</p><p>“She-…” Rio coughed, “She did?”</p><p>“Mama says it’s important to tell people you love them and… and also I think it’s nice to say so, I wanted to say it. My mama tells me everyday and I like it. So maybe you would like to hear it too. Because I do, I… so I wanted to say but I got nervous and mama said it would be okay.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, turning to the little boy with the big eyes and the hopeful grin. She opened her arm out and accepted him into a hug. Against his growing hair she whispered, “Yo también te amo, mellizo. Hasta el infinito.”</p><p>“Hasta el…?”</p><p>“Infinito. It means to infinity.”</p><p>Nicky nodded against her head and sighed out dramatically, “Hasta el infinito.”</p><p>“You sound upset, mellizo.”</p><p>“I just wish I’d said it sooner so then every night this week we could have said it.”</p><p>Rio placed her cereal bar down and held Nicky in a proper hug, “Then how about we promise to say it every day from now on?”</p><p>Nicky nodded again, “Okay, I’d like that.”</p><p>Rio hummed and gave Nicky a tight squeeze. Her gaze fell to a distant soccer game across the way and she lost herself in the sight of the tiny figures running about the place, surely having as good a time as she currently was. And all she was doing was sitting, holding her mellizo, knowing he loved her.</p><p>“Seguro y feliz,” Nicky whispered, “Dos patitos. Seguro y feliz.”</p><p>Rio turned her head and pressed a kiss to Nicky’s temple. “Dos patitos.”</p><p>The little boy in her arms pulled back and smiled his brilliant smile at her, dazzling her for a second. He placed a clumsy kiss to her cheek and Rio laughed, “Okay, okay, what about basketball? Are you ready to play?!”</p><p>Nicky grinned then and Rio laughed again as she stood with him and dragged him down to the court with the basketball from the car. She left behind their snacks and water for later on the bleachers.</p><p>On the court, with Nicky giggling and shouting, she wondered why she’d even been scared in the first place. They had the whole space to themselves, no paps, no fans, no one to have to protect Nicky from.</p><p>And for a while it was blissful.</p><p>Dos patitos running like wild animals around the deserted court. Rio could feel the pull of her body to the exercise. She could feel the rush of endorphins that came sooner now than they had been all week.</p><p>She’d been eating well, barely drinking, and she’d been sleeping better. Not to mention the calorie-killing make out sessions she’d been having.</p><p>She could feel that she was getting back to health again, less weak, sharper, more attuned to her body and her mind.</p><p>The first portion of their game lasted over an hour, then they stopped for water and snacks over at the bleachers. There were a few more people around now, a couple cars parked up. But no one was much interested in a woman and a child running like crazy people around a basketball court.</p><p>So Rio and Nicky sat happily with their snacks, blissed out still and unbothered by anyone near by.</p><p>Across the dusty little court there was someone with red hair leaning over her knees on the opposite bleachers, tapping away on her phone. But she was the closest person to them and she wasn’t a threat.</p><p>Rio had made sure to pack some fruit as well as the other chocolate and candy in the bag for fear Agatha might kill her for sending Nicky to the dentist with cavities. But the fruit got ignored because they both preferred the chocolate and Agatha wasn’t around to enforce the law.</p><p>Once refreshed they ran back onto the court and continued their quest to hit infinity points.</p><p>Play lasted for over an hour this time and even Rio was feeling the pangs of exhaustion and thirst as she shot the last hoop and bounced the ball back to Nicky.</p><p>“Time out, two secs. Give me your sweater, you must be so warm.”</p><p>She helped him shrug it off and swept his hair back from his brow, checking he wasn’t overheating after running around full pelt for so long.</p><p>“I’ll grab some water and some candy bars, okay? Keep practicing your jump shots.”</p><p>With a heavy, exhausted exhale, she turned from him and walked back to the side of the court and the bleachers. Placing Nicky’s now folded sweater down beside the bag, she first fished out her bottle and took a large, necessary gulp of water.</p><p>She could feel it trickle down her throat, and settle in her stomach. Perhaps she’d over-egged the feeling better a little. She took another mouthful and then grabbed Nicky’s and two chocolate bars from the bag, only feeling a little guilty that the apples in the bottom remained untouched.</p><p>And then she turned.</p><p>And her stomach dropped.</p><p>The red head from the opposite bleachers was now standing in the middle of the court with Nicky, bending down to get on his eye level.</p><p>Rio dropped everything in her arms and sprinted to his side, immediately pulling the little boy behind her.</p><p>Nicky gasped as he clung to her.</p><p>“Melliza!”</p><p>“Who the fuck are you and why are you talking to my kid?”</p><p>“Oh,” the woman straightened up. She was shorter than Rio by a few inches but was smirking as she looked her over, her eyes briefly flitting to Nicky peaking out from behind Rio’s hip. “I just wanted to say hello.”</p><p>Rio’s whole body felt hotter than it had felt even when she’d been tearing up the court earlier. She could feel her muscles tensing beneath her skin, either ready to fight or to run. But the woman before her seemed at ease, completely oblivious to Rio’s distress and the confusion of the little boy still hiding behind her.</p><p>The basketball had long since been forgotten and Nicky had his arms around Rio instead.</p><p>“Are you a journalist?”</p><p>“No,” the woman uttered, a vague look of amusement in her green eyes, “just a fan. I truly mean no harm.”</p><p>Her voice was sultry, pillow soft, and she looked Rio over again in a way that let Rio know she was coming on to her, or trying to, even with Nicky currently clutching at her. She sneered and took a step back, making Nicky take one too.</p><p>“You really don’t need to be worried.”</p><p>“You approached my kid and decided that-…”</p><p>“We were just getting to know one another, weren’t we, Nicky?” She looked back up at Rio and smiled, “I’m Natalie. I promise I mean no harm.”</p><p>“Melliza,” Nicky whispered, making Rio tilt her head slightly towards him but not taking her eyes off of the stranger. “She said she was a friend not, not a fan. Melliza she’s lying… Y-you’re lying!”</p><p>Nicky added the last part in a shout, leaning around Rio to look up at the woman who seemed absolutely nonplussed by the accusation. She simply raised her brows and looked expectantly up at Rio.</p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>Rio knew danger when she saw it. The woman had been watching them. She’d been waiting.</p><p>She’d lied to Nicky.</p><p>She didn’t waste another second.</p><p>She turned, gently prying Nicky off of her and ushering him ahead, keeping him out of view of the smirking stranger.</p><p>“Let’s go. Now. Quick.”</p><p>Nicky hurried along ahead of her but Rio wasn’t moving fast enough. She started to run, ushering Nicky along as quickly as she could.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Rio Vidal. Drive safe now.”</p><p>If Nicky hadn’t been there, or if Rio could have handed him over to Agatha in that moment, she’d have turned around and smacked the bitch. But he was here. Agatha wasn’t. So she didn’t. She just ran with him, got to her car, helped him into his seat and ignored his panicked questioning.</p><p>“Melliza? Melliza? Did I-…? Did I do something w-wrong?”</p><p>When he was strapped in, and Rio checked three times that he was, she jumped in the driver’s seat, turning only once to see the woman still standing there, now simply watching them from the centre of the court.</p><p>Rio put the keys in the ignition and pulled out of the parking lot.</p><p>“M-melliza?”</p><p>“You’re okay, baby. We’re okay. We’re okay.”</p><p>“She said-… She said you were her friend a-and I didn’t say anything to her, she already knew my name a-and she said she liked my hat a-and-…”</p><p>“It’s okay, mellizo. It’s okay. You did nothing wrong. Nothing at all.”</p><p>Nicky beside her was digging his fists into his eyes and Rio looked around in horror at the sight of him hiding his face below the peak of his cap.</p><p>“Nicky, I mean, I mean, mellizo. Baby. Please don’t cry. It wasn’t your fault. I shouldn’t have, fuck, I shouldn’t have left you and <em>she</em> shouldn’t have approached you.”</p><p>Rio smacked her horn, and growled in frustration. The very thing she’d promised Agatha and Nicky she could do she clearly couldn’t. She was inept, incompetent, immature.</p><p>And then a hand wrapped around her arm and Rio took a breath before she glanced at Nicky and saw in his face that he didn’t think any of those things. He still loved her. To infinity.</p><p>“Melliza?” He asked softly, his wide eyes watery, “Please don’t be sad. O-or angry. Can I have-… can we stop please? Can we? Please?”</p><p>Rio just swallowed, her throat feeling tight all of a sudden. She drove on a little further to put more distance between them and the stranger but soon pulled in along the next side street and parked up. Without saying anything she hopped out of the car and went around to Nicky’s side.</p><p>He’d already freed himself from his seatbelt by the time she got to him. He flung his arms around her neck and she did the same around his middle.</p><p>He was safe. He was unharmed. She’d kept him safe.</p><p>Nicky clung to her for more than five minutes, making her shoulder damp, but she couldn’t care about anything other than him being safe in her arms.</p><p>“I’m sorry, melliza.” He hiccuped softly, sniffing. “I thought I was doing the right thing. Mama says don’t talk to strangers a-and I don’t but she knew you a-and my name and said she was a friend a-and so I didn’t run because I-…”</p><p>“Shh,” Rio rushed out, rubbing soothing circles along Nicky’s back, “It’s okay. It’s okay. I shouldn’t have left you. I’m so sorry, Nicky.”</p><p>“M-mellizo,” Nicky corrected with a sniff, now pulling back and frowning where he looked down at the mess he’d made on Rio’s shirt. “It’s okay, you protected me. You took me away from the lady and I’m safe now. We’re both safe now. I-I-I want you to be safe with me too.”</p><p>He began to cry again and Rio pulled him right back in, holding him so fiercely she worried she might be hurting him. But he didn’t protest, he just cried quietly against her until all that was left were soft sniffles and gentle hiccups.</p><p>Rio continued to rub his back, trying to think back on how long she’d left him, how long he’d been vulnerable and exposed for. How angry Agatha would be when she told her.</p><p>But she’d endure Agatha’s wrath. Because Nicky was safe. That was all that mattered.</p><p>“Some people,” Rio said as softly as she could, not wanting Nicky to feel like he was in any trouble, “some people will know your name, and my name too, and your mama’s, and even if they say they’re friends it doesn’t mean they are okay, mi angel?”</p><p>Nicky just nodded against her, “Mama said so too. She says all the time. I forgot. I forgot.”</p><p>“I know, baby. It can be confusing. It’s okay. It’s okay.”</p><p>Only when Nicky’s sniffing had died down enough, only when he was holding onto her instead of clutching, did Rio pull back again. She gently removed his hat and wiped over his face until it was as dry as she could make it and she held him up to look her in the eye.</p><p>He smiled weakly and Rio smiled the same.</p><p>“Let’s go grab your bag and get you to the new house.”</p><p>“Okay, melliza. That… sounds good. You’re not mad?”</p><p>“Never mad at you.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio jumped into the car with him again. She checked his seatbelt three times once more and then put the keys in the ignition. The drive back was somehow less tense than the drive to the basketball court.</p><p>Perhaps because the big bad had happened. Perhaps because nothing else could possibly go wrong.</p><p>Perhaps because Nicky’s hand was holding her arm.</p><p>She parked up outside Agatha’s house and took in a deep breath. Nicky’s hand moved to her own on the wheel. She turned to him and he smiled, his cheeks a little pink from the earlier tears.</p><p>“You okay, melliza?”</p><p>“Are <em>you</em> okay, mellizo?”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio nodded too. She squeezed his hand and then released it so she could jump out and run around to get Nicky’s door. His seatbelt was already undone again and Nicky launched himself into Rio’s arms.</p><p>It was a desperate hug, a drier one than before. But Rio heaved him out of the car and held him as close as possible before she dropped him gently down again.</p><p>But away from Rio’s arms, out of the car, Nicky was tense again. This little boy couldn’t have been more different than the little boy he’d been before Rio had been an idiot. His little hand wasn’t holding hers anymore, it was <em>clutching</em>. He was squeezing the life out of it and she didn’t even know if he realised.</p><p>But Rio made long, fast strides towards Agatha’s house, making Nicky run alongside her to keep up. Inside was safe. Inside meant that no one would come to try and talk to the boy she’d been asked to look after for the day.</p><p>The boy who she’d left alone for all of ten seconds and had suddenly been approached by a stranger. She should have known. She should have done better.</p><p>They made it through the gate after Rio tapped in the code and Rio already felt herself begin to calm. But Nicky’s hold remained secure.</p><p>“Okay, kid,” she uttered in as calm a voice as she could, “Grab your bag and we’ll head back to the new house, okay? You excited?”</p><p>“Yeah, melliza.”</p><p>Nicky’s voice was quiet still, and Rio stopped before they got to the front door. She turned him to face her and dropped to one knee before him. “Baby, what happened in the park, it wasn’t your fault, okay? That lady shouldn’t have approached you. I’m sorry you got scared. You did nothing wrong. So, let’s head in, grab your bag, and then we’ll get burgers and ice cream, okay?”</p><p>Rio held Nicky’s sides and smiled hopefully up at the little boy who’s frown was slowly morphing into a shy smile. “You’re still not mad?”</p><p>“At you? Never.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and Rio smiled a little more, “So? Burgers and ice cream?”</p><p>“And movies?”</p><p>“And movies.”</p><p>Nicky nodded and his shy smile became a pleased grin as he launched himself at Rio and she grunted and then lifted him into the air with an exaggerated groan that made Nicky giggle.</p><p>He didn’t feel as heavy as he’d felt a week ago and just as Rio was wondering whether she was stronger now or if the emotions of the day had fuelled her body the door beside them opened.</p><p>Rio span with an expectant grin. Because who else but Agatha would be opening her own door?</p><p>Only it wasn’t Agatha.</p><p>It was the person Rio despised more than anyone else in the world. The person who'd tried to destroy her vida, who'd cut her mellizo's hair.</p><p>It was Evanora Harkness.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>A chill ran through Rio’s basketball-warmed body.</p><p>Of all the people in all the world, she hadn’t expected <em>her</em>. Agatha, yes. Her housekeeper? Maybe. Jen? Potentially. Even <em>Alice</em> wouldn’t have been as big a shock.</p><p>Hell, even <em>Wanda</em> wouldn’t have been as surprising.</p><p>But then, if the few Psych classes she took in College could have told her anything it was that abusers, narcissists, they thrived on their victim’s misery. Perhaps Evanora could just feel Agatha’s stress and fear and she simply manifested here, ready to feed off of it.</p><p>Rio had to shake her brain, had to make herself focus. Because it didn’t matter <em>why</em> she was here. It mattered that she <em>was</em> and that Nicky, who’d just relaxed, who’d just thrown himself at Rio, excited for burgers and ice cream and movies, was now tense and frightened in her arms.</p><p>Nicky was all that mattered.</p><p>The little boy adjusted himself in her hold to look over his shoulder just as Evanora said: “Nicholas. Come inside. Now.”</p><p>Rio’s grip on Nicky tightened and she stepped back, stumbling slightly as she fell down the small step of the porch. She managed to stand tall, to keep Nicky in her arms.</p><p>The witch before her just stared at her grandson, refusing to meet Rio’s shocked gaze.</p><p>She was tall, perhaps an inch taller than Agatha, so not as tall as Rio. Her long silvery hair was piled in a neat bun on top of her head. She was beautiful, there was no doubt about it. But sharp, her features all inclined to the dangerous, rather than the welcoming.</p><p>Agatha’s beauty was different. Completely so.</p><p>And Rio realised in an instant that, just like Nicky was nothing like his father, Agatha was nothing like her mother.</p><p>“Nicholas,” Evanora repeated, “I will not ask again. Get away from this woman.”</p><p>Evanora held out a bony hand towards them and Rio stepped back again.</p><p>Whether real or imagined Rio felt like she could feel Nicky’s heart hammering against her chest but she didn’t let go. She didn’t even loosen her hold.</p><p>She’d hold him forever, risk her muscles atrophying in this position just to keep him away from this woman.</p><p>And Nicky didn’t let go either.</p><p>His left arm, wrapped around her neck for leverage, adjusted so his fingers could bury in her short hair, tangling himself to her. It reminded Rio of what this woman had done to this little boy, of why he was currently growing his hair out. She held Nicky closer.</p><p>“Grandmother,” Nicky said quietly, “this is Rio. My… melliza.”</p><p>“Está bien, mellizo,” Rio murmured, speaking her dad’s language in a reflex, the words soothing just in the speaking of them, to her at least. She hoped Nicky understood, hoped he took comfort too in the language that she always returned to, the words that took her home.</p><p>Nicky turned to her. His cap was touching her forehead he was so close. She could feel his warm, fast breath across her cheeks and the look in his wide eyes sent shock waves through her body. He wasn’t scared, he was terrified. “Está bien,” she whispered again, giving Nicky a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>“Do you speak English?”</p><p>It wasn’t even subtle, the microaggression. Rio blinked and looked around to Evanora, seeing that she was looking at her for the first time. Her eyes were blue, but not like Agatha’s. They were an ice blue, almost unreal in their brightness. They had none of Agatha’s warmth, none of her depth.</p><p>And Rio realised that she was no longer beautiful. Her beauty disappeared the moment she saw the hatred in her blue eyes. This woman was twisted evil and there was nothing soft, nothing kind about her.</p><p>Rio swallowed. Adjusted her hold, making sure Nicky was secure in her arms. He was getting heavier but she wouldn’t drop him, she wouldn’t let him know he was anything other than safe in her arms.</p><p>Seguro hasta el infinito.</p><p>All Agatha had asked her to do was to look after her son. And as she felt Nicky’s fingers twist and tangle more securely in the hair at the base of her head, she couldn’t help but think: <em>our son</em>.</p><p>Her namesake.</p><p>Her mellizo.</p><p>The boy who loved her and wished he’d been able to say it every day.</p><p>“Grandmother,” Nicky’s cheek was practically against Rio’s now, she could feel the warmth of it, the growing heat as he continued bravely on, “Rio is, she-…”</p><p>Evanora took a step towards them and Rio took another step backwards. She’d narrowly missed grabbing Nicky’s arm and Nicky gasped quietly. Rio was suddenly under no illusion as to how frightened he was. His hold on her hair tightened and Rio would have endured the sharp pain of it for a thousand lifetimes if it meant she could also feel now how she felt with his cheek against her own.</p><p>Agatha had named him for her. She’d birthed this miracle of a child and forged him through love to create this dulce ángel clinging to her in her arms.</p><p>He was proof that Evanora had no real power over Agatha. She had none over Nicky.</p><p>She sure as shit had none over Rio.</p><p>Evanora wouldn’t get in their way. She stepped forwards and Nicky must have been fearful she was going to pass him off because he buried closer, tightened his hold of her hair. He was tugging it now with every desperate grasp and twist of his fingers, though Rio knew he wasn’t meaning to.</p><p>He was just frightened, and it made Rio feel stronger than she’d felt in weeks. She held him tighter. Nicky pressed closer. He suddenly wasn’t as heavy.</p><p>Evanora had the good sense, because it sure as shit wasn’t manners, to step aside and let Rio into the house. But she found her voice just as Rio was crossing the entranceway.</p><p>“You are <em>trespassing!</em>”</p><p>The venom in Evanora’s tone made her hold on Nicky tighten until she was worried she was hurting the boy. But he didn’t protest and kept pressed flush against her, moving in her arms only to turn back and look at his grandmother. Rio quickened her steps as Evanora shouted: “I’m calling the police!”</p><p>Empty threats, she repeated to herself. Empty threats. Agatha had given her the passcode, the key, she’d told her to look after her son for the day. She had every right to be here.</p><p>Nicky wanted her here. He’d asked for her to be here.</p><p>And how the hell was Evanora here?!</p><p>She got to the bottom of the stairs and bent to try and place Nicky down. But he held on.</p><p>Rio felt like she could no longer breathe. She straightened up, readjusted him.</p><p>“No me voy. Estaré aquí enseguida. ¿Puedes subir a buscar tu mochila? ¿Me entiendes? Estaré aquí enseguida. Ve a buscar tu mochila, mellizo.” <em>I'm not leaving. i'll be right here. Can you go upstairs and get your bag? Do you understand me? I'll be right here. Go get your bag, twin.</em></p><p>All the while Nicky looked panicked, looked wide-eyed and frightened. Rio knew he wouldn’t want to let go but she didn’t trust herself to be at the top of the stairs with Evanora close by. She’d push her down them and then she’d lose Nicky forever.</p><p>She nodded slowly, hoping Nicky understood her words, at least the context of them, the soft plea for him to run and get his bag, to get away from his grandmother for even two minutes.</p><p>It seemed like he did. Nicky reluctantly let go, his feet were on the floor but his hands were still in her hair. So Rio was down on his level, hovering between a crouch and a cry. She held his sides, held him firmly, locked eyes with her twin.</p><p>In a quieter voice than before, just for Nicky, she whispered, “Tres patitos.”</p><p>She felt his fingers flex against her scalp, felt him start to untangle himself from her. But slowly, cautiously. Even as Rio nodded encouragingly again when his hands fell to her shoulders, even when she gave him a gentle squeeze, he didn’t want to let go.</p><p>Evanora spoke from just over her shoulder. “Nicholas, come to me. This woman should not be here. It seems your mother needs to learn who she should and should not be associating with.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clicked but she kept her eyes on Nicky, tried to keep them soft. “Okay, mellizo?” She lowered her voice even further. “¿Me etiendes?” <em>Do you understand?</em></p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder and Nicky’s hands flew back to her hair, his eyes breaking their stare and looking up to his grandmother again. “Baby,” she whispered at the same time Evanora barked: “Nicholas.”</p><p>Rio began to pry Nicky’s hands from her hair as the little boy looked torn, look panicked. And Rio began to feel the panic rising in her own chest. She needed Agatha and she needed to get Nicky out of here.</p><p>“Esta bien, mellizo. Rápidamente.” She nodded towards the stairs and Nicky finally loosened his grip, looked at her one last time, and then began to stumble his way up the stairs.</p><p>She watched as he used his hands to help him up, as he kept looking back at her, as his little body tried its hardest to carry him as fast as it could.</p><p>But she couldn’t keep looking. Evanora had growled and heaved Rio around, making her face her. Rio stumbled where she’d been crouched. She fell backwards and caught herself last second, jamming her right palm onto the floor to catch herself.</p><p>She heard Nicky gasp out and looked as he began to run back down to her but she shook her head no and the boy stopped in the middle of the stairs.</p><p>“Nicholas. Here now.”</p><p>Rio grimaced as she pushed herself up and stood to her full height. “Esta bien, mellizo. Rápidamente.”</p><p>Nicky looked unsure but Rio nodded again and he turned to face back up the stairs. When he was out of sight Rio’s head was tugged backwards, a sharp, vicious movement that made her gasp in shock and pain.</p><p>She fought to keep her face neutral and made to grab at Evanora but the old woman removed her hand. She’d got the reaction she wanted.</p><p>She was nothing like Agatha, in the way she looked or the way she behaved. Agatha’s furies were bright, a sun with infinite storms. But Evanora was different. Her fury was dark, like oil bleeding across an ocean, infecting and forever changing everything in its path.</p><p>Only Rio wouldn’t let her poison anywhere near Nicky. She could try, she could inject it into Rio’s veins and drown her in it but she wouldn’t touch that boy. Not while Rio still had air in her lungs and eyes to see.</p><p>“Listen to me,” Evanora’s hand moved to her shoulder again and she felt the threat of her sharp nails but Rio chose not to flinch. “You will stay away from my grandson, and you will stay away from my daughter. You and your <em>filth</em>. Do you <em>understand</em> me?”</p><p>Rio inclined her head just a fraction, no longer attempting to keep her face neutral. She pulled her shoulder back and Evanora raised her brows. Clearly she was expecting a “yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Rio had read her right because her next words were: “I see your parents dragged you up.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed again and violence was on the tip of her tongue until she heard the heavy footsteps of a frantic little boy hurrying his way back to her. She turned from Evanora and looked up to see Nicky with a backpack too large for his small frame and a familiar looking cuddly toy in the form of some sort of floppy animal in his clutches.</p><p>“Ten cuidado, mellizo,” <em>be careful,</em> Rio called out as Nicky raced towards her.</p><p>“Nicholas,” Evanora barked again, just as Nicky flew past the first two steps. Her voice was practically shaking with rage now, “I forbid you to go anywhere with this feral woman. You are to stay with your grandmother until your mother gets home. We all need to have a little family talk.”</p><p>Rio had started up the stairs already, her arms open to grab Nicky before he could fall in his haste. He threw himself at Rio and she just about managed to keep them upright. His backpack worked as a sort of opposing force that meant she didn’t fall over backwards. He was almost impossible to hold, so she half-held, half-led him down the stairs.</p><p>But he was safe. He wouldn’t fall. Rio had him.</p><p>Back on solid ground now, Nicky pressed close and squashed his toy between them but kept his eyes on his grandmother. “I-I want to stay with Rio.”</p><p>“Out of the question,” Evanora snapped, reaching a hand towards Nicky as Rio turned to look at her, cradling Nicky’s head against her as she did.</p><p>“Dile adiós a tu abuela,” <em>say goodbye to your grandmother</em>, Rio uttered as calmly as she could, looking back at Nicky now who felt so tense against her.</p><p>Evanora scoffed and stepped closer but Rio stepped her and Nicky away, unwilling to let the woman touch the boy.</p><p>“You cannot take him from me, from this house.” Every word was spat, every consonant perfectly enunciated, every vowel rounded and whole. But no real woman with any class or high ground of any kind would have spoken like that.</p><p>Rio ducked her head down to kiss the top of Nicky’s head and whispered a quick, and what she hoped was reassuring, “Te tengo, mellizo.” <em>I’ve got you.</em></p><p>She tried to guide him now, tried to direct him around his grandmother so they could leave.</p><p>And Nicky tightened his hold then let go so he could begin moving with her. But she’d been too slow, she’d underestimated Evanora. Or perhaps she just couldn’t comprehend that anyone would hurt a kid.</p><p>Nicky’s grandmother had reached between them as Nicky had begun to pull away. He was slow, reluctant to move, but he was doing it.</p><p>He was being brave and Rio was so proud that he trusted her in that moment that she didn’t react in time.</p><p>The old witch had secured her claws around Nicky’s ear, had made him yell in shock and pain. She twisted it, tugged his head backwards.</p><p><em>“Just like your mother.”</em></p><p>Evanora had been a coiled snake up until that moment. A cobra standing tall, primed to strike. And the strike had been precise, vicious, deadly.</p><p>Her words were spat at a little boy so terrified and so innocent. And Rio saw red.</p><p>She reacted quickly this time. She grabbed Evanora’s wrist and wrenched her hand off of Nicky’s ear, throwing the crone’s arm away without mercy. She could have ripped it from its socket for all she cared. The old woman gasped and held her wrist up like Rio had burned it.</p><p>“<em>Don’t fucking touch him</em>.”</p><p>Evanora glowered.</p><p>Nicky was back to hugging her, back to clinging to her, back to trying to crawl into her skin.</p><p>“So the mongrel can speak the language of its betters?” Evanora’s laugh was high, more a cackle than anything else, but Rio didn’t stick around to watch her eyes flame in delight.</p><p>She was grabbing Nicky, trying to be firm but gentle, turning him in front of her and hurrying him as quickly as she could towards the door. She could hear her heartbeat in her ears, could feel her body curling towards Nicky, trying to form some sort of barrier between him and his grandmother even as they ran.</p><p>She’d touched him. She’d <em>hurt</em> him. She was going to kill her.</p><p>“This is kidnapping! You cannot take my grandson away from me!”</p><p>If Nicky weren’t there she might have turned around and <em>actually</em> killed the woman. But Nicky <em>was</em> there. So Nicky was instead the priority.</p><p>They reached the door, Rio leaning to help Nicky open it when Evanora’s voice sounded again, closer than it had been before. She’d been following. She was determined.</p><p>“Take your hands off of him!”</p><p>The door was open, Nicky had taken his first step out.</p><p>Rio was grabbed back, half-turned now away from the little boy.</p><p>Evanora had her claws in her forearm and Rio bared her teeth and raised her fist as Evanora clung to her arm. Her sharp talons were purposefully pressing as hard as she could. But Rio didn’t cry out. She didn’t flinch even as they broke skin.</p><p>She wouldn’t give Evanora the satisfaction.</p><p>“You have a sickness! You have infected my child with your filth. I will not let you infect my grandson, you you… <em>Mexican DOG</em>.”</p><p>Spit flew form Evanora’s lips and landed across Rio’s cheek. She fell from her brain. Everything stopped until it started again.</p><p>Until Nicky brought her back to life.</p><p>“NO! No! Let go! Let go of her!”</p><p>Nicky had joined the fray, trying to tug Rio’s arm away from Evanora but she wouldn’t release her hold and Rio wasn’t attempting to pull away. She just let her cling, let her think she had the upper hand.</p><p>But she’d lost already.</p><p>Rio had Agatha.</p><p>Rio had Nicky.</p><p>She stared into eyes of brightest blue and with a mouth full of hatred she said:</p><p>“You are not worthy of either of them.”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes widened infinitesimally and she pressed her nails in harder. But the pain of it was nothing to Rio’s loathing of the woman before her.</p><p>She wouldn’t give in. She wouldn’t cower or back down.</p><p>This woman was the reason that for almost forty years Agatha had hidden herself away, had denied herself the chance to be happy. This woman was scum, she was poison, and Rio would not let her win.</p><p>“Melliza, melliza,” Nicky began to insist, his hands grabbing Rio’s arm, still trying to pull her free of his grandmother’s hold. Rio didn’t look round but if she had she’d have seen tears falling silently from his eyes as he continued to insist before her, trying to tug her arm back still, “Está bien, melliza. Estoy aquí. Estoy aquí.” <em>It’s okay. I am here. I am here.</em></p><p>Evanora’s bright eyes flashed at the sound of her grandson speaking Rio’s language, the language he’d been learning so he could speak with her in the words of her beloved papa. The language that represented everything that Evanora was not.</p><p>The language that contained their love for one another. The language that made them a family, a brood. It had made them what they were now: tres patitos.</p><p>She saw something register on Evanora’s face as she looked between Rio’s dark gaze down to the face of Nicky, his own eyes wide, but the very reflection of his melliza’s.</p><p>Whether she recognised the stark similarity or she simply didn’t know how else to proceed, she released her hold.</p><p>With the loosening of Evanora’s grip, Rio’s arm flew back and Nicky kept a hold on her, beginning to tug her out the door. She felt the warm trickle of blood against her wrist as she turned to usher Nicky out. Nicky was practically dragging her now, holding her injured arm with that same clutching grip.</p><p>She wiped her face of Evanora’s venom and made a solemn vow: she’d not let Nicky see his grandmother ever again.</p><p>She raced with him, trying to help him by holding his backpack up as he ran with it. They must have looked insane, an Oscar Winner and a tiny boy with a big backpack chasing up the street. But they made it to Rio’s car without seeing anyone else.</p><p>Rio turned to check over her shoulder as she ripped Nicky’s door open. The street was empty. Evanora hadn’t followed.</p><p>Rio helped Nicky into his seat, made sure his belt was on, that he was secure, and placed the backpack down by his feet, not wanting to waste time getting it in the back.</p><p>She checked his ear, made sure he wasn’t bleeding. It was red, hot to the touch, but she hadn’t broken skin.</p><p>“Melliza, melliza,” Nicky chanted her nickname, trying to grab at her even as she pulled away. She didn’t have time to reassure him. She only had time to get them out, to get them as far away as possible.</p><p>She jumped into her side of the car, barely able to breathe.</p><p>“You’re bleeding!”</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay.”</p><p>Rio turned the engine on before she’d even secured her own belt and pulled from the curb as fast as she could.</p><p>“Melliza, you’re bleeding!”</p><p>“I know, baby. It’s okay. I’m okay.”</p><p>“No, no, Rio! She <em>hurt</em> you!”</p><p>Rio could feel her pulse in her throat but she had to keep going, had to get Nicky as far away as possible. She had to get to the house, the hideaway, had to get Nicky safe.</p><p>She’d fucked up. Twice. She’d exposed him to an over-familiar stranger and now she’d not been able to keep him from his evil bitch grandmother. Agatha would never trust her again. She’d never leave her alone with him.</p><p>Her head began to thump. The pain she hadn’t experienced in days now was back. Tenfold.</p><p>Nicky beside her was trying to get to her, trying to reach as his desperation took over. He was crying but Rio couldn’t comfort him. She had to keep driving, had to get them safe before she started to see any colours.</p><p>“R-Rio! Your arm! You’re hurt!”</p><p>Rio shook her head, shook it as if she were shaking off something rather than denying it. Her arm did hurt. It stung, the bitch had buried her claws in as deep as she could manage for the pure thrill of watching Rio suffer.</p><p>Punishment, Rio realised as she overtook a slow-moving truck.</p><p>The promise Agatha had been brought up with. Be too loud: punishment. Have opinions: punishment. Defy your mother in any way: punishment.</p><p>Love someone other than the straight white man I forced you to marry: punishment.</p><p>Something in Rio’s peripheral flashed and she turned to see but there wasn’t a car beside her.</p><p>“Melliza?” Nicky was breathless, desperate, his hand curling cautiously around her arm.</p><p>Rio looked down at it, saw the fierce red marks across her inner forearm where Evanora had plunged her talons. Four. Four gashes across her skin, all bloody and raw.</p><p>Nicky’s fingers were curled just by them, a stark contrast to his grandmother. Soft, gentle, cautious.</p><p>She looked back to the road again.</p><p>“Si, cariño?”</p><p>Nicky sniffed, “Why does, why does she hate you? Why did she hurt you?”</p><p>“It’s complicated, sweetheart.”</p><p>Nicky was silent for a while and Rio was fighting with her foot, feeling too trigger happy on the gas.</p><p>“I hate her.”</p><p>Nicky was sniffing again, and Rio glanced at him as he used his free hand to wipe at his eyes. He looked miserable, blotchy from tears. She took a breath and moved her arm to take his hand, her eyes already back on the road.</p><p>Nicky continued to sniff quietly, and Rio could see from the corner of her eye that he kept wiping his eyes so she knew he was still crying. But Rio kept her eyes on the road, kept checking the rear view mirror every so often just to make sure they weren’t being followed.</p><p>She had two options now, take Nicky directly to the hill house purchased to keep him hidden, to keep him out of harm’s way, or take him someplace else.</p><p>Anywhere else.</p><p>It was a decision she didn’t want to have to make. A decision she felt like she <em>couldn’t</em> make.</p><p>She glanced at Nicky again and felt his fingers curl more tightly around her hand. He was looking down at her arm and she caught his frightened stare.</p><p>Something about the way his face was now formed reminded her of Agatha. And she knew what she had to do.</p><p>She had to trust that the house would remain their sanctuary. High up in the Bird Streets in the hills, far away from the witch with the sharp claws and venomous tongue.</p><p>She looked back at the road. She swallowed. She made her decision.</p><p>They drove on in silence for a little while longer, Rio focused in on driving as safely as she could but fast, always pushing that little bit just to get them to their destination sooner. In her peripheral vision she could see Nicky clutching at the toy she’d noticed earlier and she glanced at it before she turned back. She was still in a steel deathtrap after all, she had to be extra careful.</p><p>“What’s their name?”</p><p>Nicky was silent for a second and then said, “Scratchy. I just sleep with him sometimes. I got him when I was little. I didn’t want him left with grandmother.”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, keeping her eyes on the road.</p><p>“He’ll be happy you took him.”</p><p>“Melliza,” Nicky’s voice was quiet still, almost drowned out by the hammering of her heart. “Can you call my mama, please? I don’t want her to get hurt and I want her to fix your arm and… and I want her to be with us.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, of course. I-…”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and glanced at the screen on the console between them. She didn’t know where her phone was. Somewhere in her bag which was by Nicky’s feet and now under his backpack.</p><p>“Can you get me my phone? Do you know how to use it?”</p><p>Nicky scrambled down to reach her bag and just about managed to shift his backpack but couldn’t quite get to it and Rio flew a hand out to make him sit up again. The last thing she needed was for him to hit his head in his haste to get to her phone. Or worse.</p><p>“Wait, wait. We’ll call her when we get in, okay? I promise. As soon as we’re home.”</p><p>She cursed silently for not having thought of it sooner. Of course Nicky would want his mom. Of course she should have called his mom.</p><p>Of course they needed Agatha.</p><p>But Nicky had her hand again and had placed Scratchy in her lap. She glanced down at it, recognising now that it was clearly a rabbit. He had floppy ears and that well-loved look most kids toys were never blessed with.</p><p>Nicky clearly loved him, had clearly held him many times, cuddled him all through his childhood. She imagined Nicky as a baby with the pristine version of Scratchy by his side in his crib.</p><p>And then another flash happened and she looked to see where it had come from but again saw nothing.</p><p>Nicky as a baby had reminded her that he still <em>was</em> a baby. A baby who had just been grabbed by his grandmother. A baby who had valiantly defended her, who had tried to save her even when he’d been terrified.</p><p>“Melliza?” Rio glanced Nicky’s way. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Rio swallowed the lump that had long ago lodged in her throat and nodded, “Let’s just get home, okay? Are you excited to see your new house?”</p><p>“Does my grandmother know where it is?”</p><p>“No, baby. Only us. Only us, your mama, and Jen, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded slowly, and Rio looked back at him as he focused on her arm. “And Alice? She can know too.”</p><p>“Alice can know too,” she agreed quietly, focusing back in on the road.</p><p>“Alice looks at me sometimes,” Nicky whispered, his free hand moving to touch by one of Rio’s cuts. It didn’t hurt but she looked down to see what he was doing. He was just looking, just curious. His brows pulled tightly together in a sad frown and Rio wondered whether he was still trying to understand how someone could do what his grandmother had did.</p><p>The apple had fallen very far from the poisoned tree.</p><p>“She looks at you?”</p><p>Rio knew what Nicky meant but she was too caught up on getting them to the house safely, on fighting the pain in her head, on avoiding flashing lights.</p><p>Nicky sniffed, “I don’t think she likes me.”</p><p>Rio bit down on the inside of her cheek, she stared out the front window, she cleared her throat quietly, “Did you know I’ve known Alice since I was eighteen? Almost half my life?”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded, keeping her eyes forward even as she could feel Nicky looking up at her. “So she knows my face really well. Really, really well. And I think when she looks at you she’s actually just looking because-…”</p><p>“Because we look a little the same.”</p><p>Rio smiled a little and glanced at Nicky. “Exactly, mellizo.”</p><p>Nicky’s hand flexed against her arm and then he held her hand in two of his. “Maybe more than a little, you know. Maybe that’s why my grandmother was so…”</p><p>Rio stuck her tongue in her cheek as she took a bend, wending their way up now into the hills. Nicky was wiser than his years. He had his mom’s intellect, her desire to learn, to know more than she was offered.</p><p>She remained silent, let him think his thoughts for a little while.</p><p>The further into the hills they got the more she felt like she could breathe. But she didn’t have the SatNav on. She had to keep a close eye on the street signs.</p><p>“Mama will be upset,” Nicky whispered, and Rio could feel his eyes on her again. She held his hands a little tighter.</p><p>“Only because she’ll be worried about you, mellizo. But she’ll be okay. We’ll be okay.”</p><p>She took a turn up a steeper hill.</p><p>“She’ll be upset that you’re hurt and that,” Rio paused, realising they were on the right street. She slowed down, feeling her heart rate slow alongside the engine. “that you got scared.”</p><p>“And that you’re bleeding,” Nicky added so quietly Rio almost missed it as she concentrated.</p><p>“Sí, mellizo.” She was distracted, too intent on getting to the right house. There weren’t many on the street, in fact, she didn’t see one for a while and soon became worried she’d forgotten the address.</p><p>But then there it was, cresting just over the break of the hill. From the looks of it, it was a mission revival style house. White and terracotta, not quite the Spanish style of Rio’s house across town. Rio pulled up to the large gate and leant out to input a code, her own birthday, chosen because who would guess that knowing the day Rio Vidal first breathed life into the world would be the key needed to access Agatha Harkness and her son.</p><p>She pulled in slowly, on high alert for anyone else suddenly appearing. But it was just the house. Just Nicky, Rio, Scratchy, and the house.</p><p>Rio parked up, she went to help Nicky, and found that more than that was impossible now the boy had his arms around her neck and his face pressed in against her shoulder. She relaxed enough to not hurry him along, to not insist they get moving.</p><p>She relaxed enough to hold him for as long as he needed held and only when he felt ready did she begin to pull back. Her heart was in her throat, the pain in her head subsiding with each second Nicky clung to her, only to be vanquished entirely by his next words: “Te amo, melliza. Está bien.”</p><p>“Nicholas River Harkness,” she said slowly, deliberately, wanting him to understand her completely. She pulled back and Nicky’s brows knit together as if he were afraid he were in trouble. But Rio just wanted to say his full name, wanted to speak aloud the pieces of him that were Agatha and the tiny piece of him that was her.</p><p>“I love you too. Very much. And I am so proud of you for being so brave. I promise I’ll keep you safe. You and your mama.”</p><p>Nicky nodded slowly and took an audible breath in before he said: “Sí. Entiendo. Lo sé.”</p><p>Rio didn’t have to force herself to smile. Nicky looked worried still, his eyes ever-wide, but his lips trembled into a half-smile too and she kissed his cheek as a seal of their agreement.</p><p>Rio loved him. She’d keep him safe.</p><p>She hurried him then, grabbing his bag and her own. They made their way to the front door together and Rio found that the closer they got, the closer Nicky got. But she held his hand firmly, and with her non-dominant hand she found the keys Agatha had left her.</p><p>She fumbled in her haste but she managed it.</p><p>She let them in, she expected Nicky to go ahead but he stayed back. So she stepped inside first.</p><p>The house smelled different, unlike Agatha’s actual home. It hadn’t been lived in by her yet so Rio didn’t know why she was expecting to have Agatha’s stamp all over it. But then she turned her head and on the console table where she placed her keys was a framed photograph of Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>And in front of it, lay a light blue origami flower.</p><p>Rio swallowed, knowing Agatha had left it for her.</p><p>But Nicky hadn’t moved yet and she knew he was waiting for her to do so. She looked up, looked into the quiet house. They needed to call Agatha to let her know what had happened but that they were safe but first Rio needed to make sure they were.</p><p>She shouldered Nicky’s backpack and walked him through to find the living room and found it to be open, airy, a pretty space with prettier furnishings. Money couldn’t buy taste but Agatha had both in droves.</p><p>They didn’t stop there. She took them instead deeper into the house, passing a guest bathroom, the chef’s kitchen, and through again until she found a smaller family room. It was decorated just as well as the first lounge but was cosier, and she felt safer already.</p><p>She placed Nicky’s backpack down by the coffee table and settled with him close beside her on the couch. But something still didn’t feel right.</p><p>She stood and Nicky stood too. She’d turned to tell him to wait on the couch but saw his face and said nothing.</p><p>Safety was paramount but reassurance was a close second. A very close second judging by the fact that Nicky had been silent since they’d stepped into the house and was still clutching her hand.</p><p>So she walked with him round each room of the lower floor of the house and with his help she closed every blind and every drape. No one would see in. No human eyes, no long lens, no flying drone.</p><p>They’d be safe.</p><p>Only then did she take Nicky back to the couch. Only then did she offer him a drink or some snacks.</p><p>He refused both and was soon crawling into her lap.</p><p>There, in the dark house high up in the hills of Hollywood, Rio Vidal sat with her frightened mellizo. Nicky was in her lap, his arms around her neck, his head resting against her shoulder. She held him close, held him securely, his little knees pointing up to the sky and tucked in against her side.</p><p>He was safe now. No one knew where they were. No one could see in.<br/>
She leant over when Nicky was comfortable and with the tips of her fingers managed to grab the strap of her cross-body black bag. She pulled it onto the couch with them and fished out her cell.</p><p>When the screen lit she saw that she had the usual number of texts and calls but none from Agatha or Jen. Good. Nothing had happened on their end.</p><p>Only five texts from Alice appeared and one missed call.</p><p>She didn’t check them.</p><p>She instead pressed to dial Agatha and held the phone to her ear. Nicky shuffled a bit to sit up more.</p><p>Agatha answered after one ring.</p><p>“Rio,” she said her name on an inhale and Rio could feel the worry in her voice.</p><p>“We’re safe,” she reassured quickly, needing Agatha to know that at least. “We’re at the house. Nicky is right here with me.”</p><p>“What’s happened?” Agatha knew. Of course she did. Why else would Rio, a woman who never picked up her phone, choose to pick up her phone to call Agatha when she knew she was busy.</p><p>She took a breath, felt Nicky tangle his fingers in her hair.</p><p>“Your mother was at the house. We’re fine, we-…”</p><p>“Put Nicky on.”</p><p>Rio blinked. It wasn’t usual for Agatha to dismiss her like that. Something settled in her stomach as she passed the phone to Nicky and whispered: “Your mama.”</p><p>Perhaps Agatha was mad. Perhaps she was done with her. Perhaps…</p><p>But Nicky had begun to speak a mile a minute and she realised what it was instantly. Rio would tell half-truths, seeking to inform but to placate, to soften. Nicky would tell the whole truth, unencumbered by the burden of guilt, not frightened of what Agatha might say to him, simply determined to get her here sooner.</p><p>“Mama, she was just in the house and she tried to get me to stay with her but I didn’t want to and Rio wouldn’t let her and, and,” he took two sharp breaths and Rio kissed his temple. “And Rio got me to the stairs but she kept coming and was saying bad things to Rio and, and I went up the stairs but then she pushed Rio but Rio told me to go so I ran I ran so fast and I got my bag and Scratchy and came back down and Rio was waiting for me and then grandmother grabbed my ear and Rio shouted at her and then we kept going even as she kept shouting at us to stop but then then she grabbed Rio and and she’s bleeding mama she hurt her arm but she wouldn’t let go but I tried to make her and and she called her she she called her a dog then we got away and we drove we drove up to here and we’ve closed all the blinds so it’s just us and we want you with us please come please come now we want you mama I want you here please don’t go home please don’t go home.”</p><p>Nicky was crying again and Rio waited with bated breath to hear what Agatha would say on the other end of the line. She pulled Nicky close, cradled his head, covering the ear that had been grabbed by Evanora with her hand. Agatha’s voice was faded, and Ro knew she’d be moving already, would have wrapped up the meeting with a simple look to Jen and would be on her way.</p><p>“I’m coming, honey. You stay right there with Rio. She’ll keep you so safe. I love you, I’m coming. Pass the phone back to Rio, honey.”</p><p>Nicky did as he was told and buried back in against her. Rio took a deep breath before she placed the phone to her ear and as soon as she had she heard Agatha’s sharp voice: “You’re hurt.”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“That isn’t what Nicky said. What did she-…”</p><p>Rio shook her head and held Nicky that bit tighter, feeling him silent cry into her shirt. “Just get back as quickly as you can.”</p><p>“He said you were bleeding.”</p><p>“It’s healed. I promise I’m okay.”</p><p>In the background she heard Jen’s voice and Alice’s name being spoken. Agatha said nothing for a second and then whispered, “He’s okay?”</p><p>“He’s okay.”</p><p>“You’re okay?”</p><p>“I’m okay.”</p><p>“Tell me what she said.”</p><p>Rio shook her head silently again, unable to even think the words she’d said, let alone repeat them with Nicky close.</p><p>“No. Come back, drive safe. We’ll see you soon.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha insisted but Rio could barely stand to hear her voice and not see her face. She closed her eyes, felt Nicky shuffle up until he could lean in and speak to his mama too.</p><p>“Mama hurry please. Please hurry.”</p><p>She heard Agatha’s breath, heard her struggle with it. Then: “I’m coming. I’ll be there soon. Don’t worry, honey. I’m coming.”</p><p>“Drive safe,” Rio whispered and before Agatha could say anything else, she hung up.</p><p>Nicky hugged her again and Rio held him through it, wondering what he was feeling and whether Agatha had ever been more scared or angry in her life. She didn’t think so, assumed she must be on the verge of erupting.</p><p>It would come. She knew it would. It was just whether it was directed solely at Evanora or whether Rio would be burned by the flames.</p><p>Nicky eventually settled down against her again and Rio felt like she could breathe with him close but felt pain with every breath.</p><p>What if Agatha realised she was incompetent. What is she found her to be all those things she’d accused her of being: not ready, a child, immature.</p><p>She sighed quietly and closed her eyes as she rested back into the cushions.</p><p>Her headache was knocking again.</p><p>They just had to wait for Agatha.</p><p>Rio just had to wait to see how long it would be before Nicky was ripped away from her and Agatha broke it all off.</p><p>As they sat there in the near-darkness, Nicky was quieter than she’d ever known him to be. He just held on, toyed with the ends of her hair. It took her back to having him against her when Agatha had been asleep and Nicky had been attempting to fool her into thinking he was.</p><p>Only no one was fooling anyone anymore. Everything was out in the open, raw and bloody like the  untreated wounds on Rio’s wrist and forearm.</p><p>As time ticked on she checked in on Nicky every so often, making sure he knew he was safe, that his mama was still coming, that she was still here. Every soft utterance in Spanish was met with a gentle head nod from the boy but he made no sound.</p><p>By the time Rio heard the front door being opened, she’d petrified around the little boy. Her bones had cemented in their position, her muscles frozen in their protective hold. After all, she had Agatha’s heart in her lap. He was safe in her arms. She had to keep him safe, had to keep him protected, and so she didn’t move. Even when everything ached, even when she had to fight the urge to fidget, to stretch, to tear the paint from the walls with her fingernails just to feel try to rid her body of the anger she felt.</p><p>She remained still. She held Nicky, protected Agatha’s heart.</p><p>By her reckoning it had been close to forty minutes before there was noise again in the silent house. No more than an hour. No less than thirty.</p><p>She heard frantic footsteps and Jen’s voice shouting Agatha’s name.</p><p>And then.</p><p>There she was. Standing in the entrance to the dark family room Rio had holed them up in. At some point in the day she must have shed her blazer because it was no longer on her tense frame. She was wearing her glasses, her hair twice the volume it had been when she’d left that morning, evidence of her hysteria, evidence of her fear.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks were pale beneath the large-frames but creeping down her neck and across what could be seen of her chest through her white shirt, Agatha was flushed. Her sleeves were rolled up and Rio knew it must have been a nervous impulse, something to do as she shouted at Jen to drive faster, for more gas! More gas!</p><p>And her eyes, her eyes were what she focused on next, what she couldn’t look away from. Storms of terror were raging in them.</p><p>Agatha was drowning even as she stood on solid ground.</p><p>Rio’s frozen hold on Nicky broke open as he struggled from her lap and flew across the space to get to his mama. Rio watched as he tried to climb up her, as Agatha bent to catch him, as she struggled to lift the desperate child into the air.</p><p>Rio couldn’t move. She could no longer look.</p>
