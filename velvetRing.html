<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio was in that dreamy, hazy space between sleep and wakefulness when her phone buzzed.</p><p>She had put her ringer on for her alarm before bed like she always did but hadn’t remembered to put her phone on airplane mode.</p><p>She groaned groggily before forcing one eye open, squinting hard against the bright light of the screen in the black of her room.</p><p>It was a message from a parent on the app she used to find childcare work.</p><p>Rio was studying her Masters in Biology, but she worked as a nanny for most of her time. Her usual family had just moved away, leaving her jobless and heartbroken, having formed a close bond with the girl she used to look after.</p><p>Right now, she was desperate for any work she could get, bills piling up and already two weeks behind on rent. Her flatmate and best friend, Alice, had already offered twice to cover her for the month, but she couldn’t accept.</p><p>Rio Vidal didn’t like to owe anyone anything.</p><p>The message was from ‘Ralph’, a father 1.6 miles away.</p><p>
<em>Hi Rio, you look like a great fit for our family. We have one lovely little boy called Nicky (6) who we need help with three days a week. Would this be something you’re interested in?</em>
</p><p>Rio navigated to the man’s profile and squinted at his photo. A selfie taken on a walk with Nicky on his shoulders – the boy was sweet enough looking.</p><p>To the side of the image was a brown blur that looked like long hair.</p><p>It was 22:58, and kind of late to reply, but Rio did it anyway.</p><p>
<em>Sure, sounds good. Would you want me to come over and meet him soon?</em>
</p><p>A few more messages back and forth and it was decided. Rio would go to watch Nicky for a few hours that Friday morning.</p><hr/><p>Rio dressed for the occasion with her usual lackadaisical attitude. Today’s outfit was her signature black jean and long sleeve shirt combo, dark boots matching the smear of eyeliner on her waterline.</p><p>She grabbed a piece of toast from Alice’s plate on her way through the kitchen and out of the flat.</p><p>‘Hey!’ her friend protested half-heartedly, reaching out a hand to swat at Rio’s behind.</p><p>‘Buh-byeeeee,’ Rio called, deliberately swinging her hips as she sauntered out of sight, toast dangling from one side of her mouth.</p><p>Ralph’s house was a decent thirty-minute walk, plenty of time for Rio to plug in her airpods and hit play on her ‘Autumn’ playlist. Oh, the sweet sting of Phoebe Bridgers on a freezing cold morning.</p><p>A tentative knock on the door (she always convinced herself she had the wrong house) led to audible thudding footsteps pounding down the stairs inside. Rio smiled in spite of herself, then quickly smoothed it off her face.</p><p>Ralph opened the door without meeting her eyes, one arm on the doorjamb and the other gripping the back of a little boy’s head, keeping him from escaping.</p><p>‘Hi,’ Rio cooed, not using a baby voice because <em>fuck that shit</em>, but just a soft one. ‘You must be Nicky?’</p><p>Nicky beamed immediately, reaching for her hand.</p><p>Rio dropped to a crouch and took his hand gently.</p><p>‘A pleasure to make your acquaintance, good sir.’</p><p>Nicky shook her hand, face serious and momentarily adult.</p><p>Rio dropped the pretence and shot him a wink before standing up again, her left knee popping audibly. She really needed to make good on that New Year’s resolution of joining the gym. Ralph was watching her with barely disguised interest.</p><p>Rio suppressed a little curl of disgust in her belly and extended her hand to Nicky’s father.</p><p>‘Hi Ralph, I’m-,’</p><p>‘Rio,’ Nicky shouted, turning and running into the house with the reckless abandon only small children possess, narrowly avoiding tripping over a Lego house at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>‘Mama, Rio’s here!’ he all but screamed.</p><p>Rio stepped into the house, unzipping and shucking off her boots in a pile as was her way, before remembering herself and neatening them up.</p><p>Ralph began walking down the corridor, deeper into the heart of the house. He was saying something to Rio over his shoulder, making idle small talk, but she was hardly listening.</p><p>Her senses were assailed by the heavenly scent of freshly baked brownies, and she was getting lightheaded from how many deep inhales she had taken through her nose. She barely resisted the urge to swear.</p><p>Ralph (and her nose) led her into a small living area with a conjoined kitchen.</p><p>Back to the room, there was a woman standing at the sink, washing up the brownie batter bowl.</p><p><em>Ah</em>, Rio thought, <em>the owner of all that dark, wild, wavy hair.</em></p><p>Nicky was clinging to his mother’s leg, thumb creeping its way into his mouth as his initial excitement faded and nervous shyness took over.</p><p>His mother dried her hands on the towel next to the sink and turned around.</p><p>‘Rio, this is Nicky’s mom, Agatha.’ Ralph said, gesturing at his wife without looking at her, reading something on his phone.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t wearing any make-up, eyes soft and tired, and there was flour on her sweater and a smudge of brownie batter on her upper lip.</p><p>‘Hi,’ she said softly, smiling a little uncertainly at Rio.</p><p>Agatha was <em>beautiful</em>.</p><p>And Rio was <em>fucked</em>.</p><hr/><p>Agatha disappeared upstairs, presumably to shower and change, and Rio was very much okay with having a beat to recollect herself. Ralph made a song and dance about brewing her a coffee in their cafetiere, and by 9:30, she was alone with Nicky.</p><p>‘What do you wanna do, buddy?’ she asked carefully, lowering herself to his height again.</p><p>Nicky looked up at her with his father’s chocolatey-brown eyes and smiled a slow grin.</p><p>‘Lego!’ he exclaimed, before charging back down the corridor to the living room, slipping where one of his socks had come down.</p><p>The living room was an apt name for it, and it was instantly Rio’s favourite room in the house.</p><p>The kitchen and dining area were impersonal, but this room was fully decorated, co-ordinated throws on each couch, stripy blue bows tying the curtains back and exposing the view of the street.</p><p>Art covered each wall, one side totally dedicated to floral paintings, instantly endearing to Rio, who loved flowers. She had three different flower tattoos.</p><p>A giant mirror with a gilded, golden edge opened up the space and reflected all the natural light back into the room.</p><p>Rio had a feeling it was all Agatha.</p><p>Interestingly, there weren’t any family photos up, just the art, and a detailed pencil sketch of Nicky, which was very good, but didn’t look exactly like him.</p><p>Whilst Rio took in her surroundings, Nicky was busy pulling a box out from the drawer under the television.</p><p>Without pomp or circumstance, he upended the entire thing onto the carpet, close to a thousand tiny Lego pieces spilling everywhere. His head snapped up to test Rio’s reaction, and she shielded her smile.</p><p>‘Let’s play,’ she said, and Nicky beamed.</p><hr/><p>Alice pounced on Rio as soon as her key turned in the door of their shared flat.</p><p>‘Well?’ she said expectantly, eyebrow cocked.</p><p>Before she had even opened her mouth to respond, Rio found herself blushing stupidly.</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. ‘Rio….’</p><p>Rio let her head fall onto Alice’s shoulder with a groan, burying her face in her red hair and mumbling into her ear.</p><p>‘My loser lesbian rating just went up five points.’</p><p>Alice took hold of her elbows and steered her into their living room, guiding her down gently into a sitting position before flopping down herself.</p><p>‘So,’ she deadpanned. ‘The mom’s hot.’</p><p>Rio flushed again, hand snapping out to thwack Alice’s elbow. Was she really that obvious? That much of a fucking cliché?</p><p>She groaned, peeking out at her friend from between her fingers.</p><p>‘Well yes. But, worse.’ she replied, drawing out the sound of the ‘s’. Alice stared expectantly.</p><p>‘Alice, she’s <em>beautiful</em>.’</p><p>‘Oh jeez,’ Alice said, eyes bright with sympathy. ‘Yeah, that is worse.’</p><p>And that was only day one.</p><hr/><p>Morning, Nicky’s house. Two weeks in.</p><p>Rio had been pleasantly surprised by Agatha at the door that day, Ralph away at some squash club. Agatha had barely supressed an eye-roll when she imparted this information.</p><p>So it was Nicky’s mother who made her coffee, and brought out a mini half-pint carton of oat milk with it, setting everything out on the table with the care of a child playing at a tea party.</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s squint of confusion at the milk.</p><p>‘Oh sorry, do you take it black?’ Agatha asked, her left front tooth sneaking out to worry at her bottom lip.</p><p>‘No, I-’ Rio flushed. ‘I told Ralph that yes, but I didn’t think you guys would have any plant milk.’</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, which prompted Rio to keep talking.</p><p>‘I actually like it, like, stupidly milky.’</p><p>She cursed herself for her babbling, but Agatha’s face lit up a bit as she looked back at Rio.</p><p>‘Same.’</p><p>They shared a brief moment then, a millisecond of direct eye contact, before Nicky clambered into his mother’s lap and announced himself loudly.</p><p>‘I want a Nicky coffee.’</p><p>Agatha immediately busied herself with fussing over her son, letting him cling to her neck as she shuffled into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio trailed behind them, standing out of place in the small kitchen, before leaning her weight against the counter.</p><p>A ‘Nicky coffee’ turned out to be a warm milk with a spoonful of malt powder. Agatha took special care to show Rio just how to make it, exactly 38 seconds in the microwave, and something about the gesture made her chest tighten.</p><p>Here was a mother who loved her son very much. It almost hurt to look at. <em>Almost</em>.</p><p>When everyone had a hot drink, they settled back at the table, Rio’s long legs bunched up comically as she perched on Nicky’s highchair, just because he’d told her to. Agatha had looked pleased at that.</p><p>Rio found herself telling Agatha about her studying, about Alice, and her other nannying experience. The whole time she was talking, she was distantly aware that she wanted to stop, that she wanted to hear about Agatha instead. She wanted to know everything about her, everything she’d thought about so far that day, what she dreamed about last night. She wanted to ask these questions. But she just couldn’t stop talking.</p><p>Agatha listened to it all with interest that was seemingly unfeigned, balancing Nicky on her lap as he occasionally interjected with his own funny commentary. When Rio’s stupid run-away mouth finally took a break, as she forced herself to take sips of her coffee, Agatha asked the question she spent her life trying to avoid.</p><p>‘And family? Do you-,’ Agatha paused, trailing off as she noted Rio’s subtle change of facial expression. Her cheeks were warm, had been for twenty minutes, but she felt them burning now.</p><p>‘I- sorry.’ Agatha said lamely, before ostentatiously busying herself with Nicky, wiping at a non-existent milk dribble on his cheek.</p><p>Rio’s mouth was opening and closing like a stupid fish, and for the life of her she couldn’t think how to save the moment.</p><p>Agatha made the decision for her, standing up with a tiny moan of discomfort as she settled Nicky down. Rio’s eyes tracked every movement.</p><p>‘Well, I’d better get some work done,’ she said, meeting Rio’s gaze once more. ‘Give me a shout if you need anything?’</p><p>The soft look on her face left the unspoken implied.</p><p>
<em>You or Nicky.</em>
</p><p>Rio nodded quickly, looking down into her mug so her hair covered her pink face. She was such a fucking oversharer, and now she’d made things weird, and Agatha thought she was damaged goods. And why should she care anyway?</p><p>She’s my boss, Rio reminded herself, hopping up to grab pens and paper for Nicky. And once more for good measure, <em>she’s my boss.</em></p><hr/><p>Agatha was in Rio’s dream that night.</p><p>It wasn’t immediately clear it was her. Rio dreamt she was lying back on her bed, supporting somebody’s full body weight as they lay with their head on her chest. She shifted under the sheets, fully clothed and just on the wrong side of too warm, in the pyjamas she’d put on for bed, confusion bunching up her features.</p><p>The woman lying on top of her was naked, resting on her stomach, face tucked out of sight as she slept on Rio.</p><p>She realised it was Agatha because of her hair. That thick, gorgeous hair was spilling all around her, enveloping her head like a halo.</p><p>Rio knelt forward the smallest bit, careful not to wake her. She pressed the tip of her nose very gently to Agatha’s hairline, inhaled deeply, and brought her palm up from under the sheet to rest against her lower back. At the feel of her heated, bare skin, Rio let out a tiny mewl of want.</p><p>Then she woke up.</p><p>Disoriented, pulse beating hard between her legs, Rio sat up. She was actually panting. <em>Fuck.</em></p><hr/><p>Lunchtime coffee with Agatha became routine. It was actually the highlight of Rio’s day, not that she admitted it to anyone other than herself. She loved Nicky, loved playing with him, but that precious hour of the day while he napped, perched at the table with Agatha, ever-cold fingers clutching a steaming mug of coffee, that was everything.</p><p>Rio was learning things about her, drawing them out like a fisherman slowly winding in their line.</p><p>She learned that Agatha practiced tarot (obsessively), how she liked her toast (essentially hot bread), what she studied at college (English Lit), what she liked to read (fantasy and horror), and her favourite herbal tea (lavender + aniseed).</p><p>Rio collected these little tidbits, tiny pieces of Agatha, and tucked them neatly away in that pocket of skin over her breastbone that the older woman was starting to occupy.</p><p>One particularly memorable morning, Agatha asked about Rio’s tattoos.</p><p>Rio had noticed her noticing them, the visible ones, and had been waiting for Agatha to bring it up. She had been expecting it, preparing for it, but when it came, it still took her by surprise.</p><p>Instead of just asking, Agatha’s hand slid across the table, took Rio’s in hers, and in one deft movement, flipped it over so the black lines were visible. She traced a thumb over Rio’s inner wrist, making her shiver minutely. Agatha pretended not to notice.</p><p>‘What do these mean?’ she asked quietly, eyes flicking to Rio’s, blue encircling black.</p><p>She kept her fingers pressed to Rio’s tattoo, thumb resting right over her pulse. There was no way she couldn’t feel how fast it was going, thrumming under her skin like an erratic drumbeat.</p><p>‘Uh-,’ Rio started dumbly, before clearing her throat. ‘They’re poppies.’</p><p>Rio blushed. Obviously, Agatha knew that. She smiled at Rio kindly, encouraging her to keep talking.</p><p>‘To me they mean – well in flower language-’ (another blush) ‘they can symbolise messages sent in dreams. I guess, I believe that dreams <em>do</em> have meaning. I think I take a lot of guidance from them.’</p><p>Rio took hold of Agatha’s hand then, clasping it for a brief, blessed moment before gently removing it from her arm and placing it down on the table. She turned her palm back over, and pulled her t-shirt up until her inner elbow was visible.</p><p>‘And these… they’re lilies.’</p><p>Rio hesitated, but Agatha was staring at her skin with interest, fingers twitching like she wanted to touch her here too. Rio desperately wanted her to.</p><p>‘They mean, well, they have a lot of meanings, but to me they’re about loss.’</p><p>Agatha’s eyes crinkled in sympathy as she looked back up at Rio. Rio took a deep breath and continued.</p><p>‘You once asked me about family, but- I- I don’t have one. There’s actually no record of where I came from, like I just spawned or something. I grew up in the care system. I guess that’s one of the things that drew me to working with children.’</p><p>Agatha’s expression didn’t change as Rio was talking, simply nodding in understanding. Instead of probing for more like most people would, or offering some lame apology, she gestured back to the ink on Rio’s skin.</p><p>‘You said you had four?’ she prompted.</p><p>Rio pulled the neck of her shirt to the side and showed Agatha the third one, just below her collarbone.</p><p>‘Not flowers?’</p><p>‘Uh-no. It’s the three stages of a woman’s life.’ Rio pointed at the first figure. ‘The maiden.’</p><p>Agatha’s eyes followed the trace of her finger with interest.</p><p>‘The mother,’ Rio said, quieter now, pad of her finger brushing the second figure, complete with swollen belly.</p><p>‘And, the crone,’ she finished, pointing to the final woman drawn on her skin, shorter than the other two, and curved over like she was bending.</p><p>‘Ah, yes, the crone. That’s me.’</p><p>‘No, Agatha, you’re like-’</p><p>Rio cut herself off there and Agatha raised an eyebrow in question. When Rio didn’t continue, she moved on.</p><p>‘Your fourth?’</p><p>Rio’s cheeks darkened further and she shook her head slightly.</p><p>‘Uh- the fourth one’s on my ribs. So I can’t show you.’</p><p>Rio was pretty fucking shameless but there were limits, and that included taking her shirt off in front of her employer. No matter how pretty she was.</p><p>Agatha surprised her then with a wicked smirk and an eyebrow raise.</p><p>‘Wanna see mine?’</p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open as she stared back at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha Harkness, suburban housewife and mother, had a hidden tattoo.</p><p>Without waiting for Rio’s response, Agatha shifted her weight in the chair and unceremoniously pulled her sweater up, exposing the entire plane of bare skin beneath her bra, and a tiny sliver of ink above it.</p><p>Rio’s brain short-circuited.</p><p>‘Can you see it?’ she asked, peeking back over her shoulder to look at Rio.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up a moment too late, and she swallowed around her dry mouth.</p><p>‘Uh-,’ she said, voice coming out in a kind of cracked whisper. She coughed a little. ‘Not quite.’</p><p>Before she could think better of it, Rio leant forward, instantly overwhelmed with being in Agatha’s space, clasped the bottom of the sweater and raised it up to her shoulders.</p><p>A decent crop of goosebumps sprang up on Agatha’s neck. Rio couldn’t stop staring at them.</p><p>When Agatha spoke, after a beat, her voice was low.</p><p>‘Now?’</p><p>Rio tore her gaze away from Agatha’s neck and took in the tattoo.</p><p>It was right in the middle of her shoulder blades, stark and dark against Agatha’s pale, freckled skin.</p><p>It was pretty fucking cool actually. Agatha had a tarot card inked on her, a skull peering out from a black cloak. The insignia read ‘Death.’</p><p>With a sharp tug, Agatha covered herself and whipped round to face Rio again.</p><p>At Rio’s incredulous expression she gave a small smirk.</p><p>‘I was a pretty morbid 18 year old,’ she said, by way of explanation.</p><p>Rio was distantly aware that her mouth was still open, stuck around some vowel her throat was trying to produce. She shut it with a snap, tucking her hair behind her ears in a nervous gesture.</p><p>Agatha stood up abruptly, dusting invisible crumbs onto the floor.</p><p>‘Was that Nicky?’ she asked, voice back to normal.</p><p>Rio scrambled up like she’d been caught doing something wrong and dashed into the living room without a backward glance.</p><p>Nicky was fast asleep on the sofa, silent.</p><p>Rio caught her own gaze in the mirror, face aflame. She walked right up to her reflection, and leaned forward until her burning forehead was pressed against the cool glass.</p><hr/><p>It was Tuesday, the best day of Rio’s week.</p><p>Agatha had yoga class, so she was greeted by Ralph each Tuesday morning.</p><p>She always spent that first hour playing with Nicky on his bedroom floor, tucked up on the cushion by the radiator, head leant back on the window.</p><p>Her reasoning was this: on Tuesdays, after yoga, Agatha came in through the back gate. Which afforded Rio a perfect view of her from Nicky’s room.</p><p>They waited for her together, knees on the floor as if in prayer, noses pressed to the glass, breath fogging up the window.</p><p>To make Nicky laugh, Rio drew stars and smiley faces in the condensation.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha would come through the gate, and Nicky would knock like mad on the window.</p><p>She’d look up, startled, her face breaking into an easy smile as she saw her son waving through the glass. Then her eyes would flick to Rio’s, returning the wave and beaming up at them.</p><p>Best part of Rio’s week.</p><p>And that was to say nothing of the tight yoga pants Agatha wore, the cropped vests with her sports bra visible through the thin material, toned arms out and bare.</p><p>This week, Agatha came through the gate as usual, a few minutes late. Nicky had grown bored with waiting for his mom and was playing with a train across the room.</p><p>So it was only Rio watching from the window as Agatha opened the gate, only Rio she looked up at and saw, despite the lack of knocking.</p><p>Rio’s heart seized. They held eyes for a moment, before Agatha smirked.</p><p>She turned around slowly, drawing out the anticipation for something Rio couldn’t understand yet.</p><p>And then she did.</p><p>Agatha was wearing tight navy yoga pants that looked almost velvety. Across her ass was the word <em>‘Naughty’</em> in rhinestones. She bent down ostentatiously to relock the garden gate, making sure Rio had seen them.</p><p>Rio did not close her mouth in time, and Agatha caught her dumbfounded look like a victory ball, winning smile plastered on as she sauntered through the garden.</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
<em> </em>
</p><p>Rio waxed poetic to Alice about those pants for forty minutes that evening.</p><hr/><p>In the first week of November, Agatha turned 40.</p><p>Rio didn’t know it was her birthday until she showed up for work that morning, Nicky visible through the living room window, bouncing up and down in excitement.</p><p>He flung open the door with a massive grin opening up his face and jumped without a second thought into Rio’s arms.</p><p>‘Rio!’ he all but roared.</p><p>Rio laughed, catching him easily and bringing him up to rest on her hip.</p><p>‘What is it buddy?’ she asked, jogging him once, twice, three times, just to hear him laugh.</p><p>‘It’s Mama’s birthday!’ he squealed, wriggling out of Rio’s grasp and tearing away to the kitchen.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard against the sudden lump in her throat. She ducked her head around the corner.</p><p>The living room was strung up with banners and handmade paper chains, four helium balloons standing guard in each corner. ‘Happy 40<sup>th</sup>’ emblazoned on each.</p><p>Rio’s stupid heart stuttered when she entered the kitchen after Nicky and saw Agatha.</p><p>She was wearing jeans with a handsewn gingham patch on the left thigh, barefoot and singing to herself as she wiped down the counter with a dishrag. No sweater today, just a vest top, despite the cold air outside. One strap was hanging off her shoulder, exposing her bra band.</p><p>‘Hi,’ Rio breathed, unable to tear her eyes away or to keep the reverence from her voice.</p><p>‘Oh, hi Rio!’ Agatha chirped, uncharacteristic excitement on her face. She was wearing carefully applied makeup, a soft red lipstick and a dark rim around her blue eyes.</p><p>‘Happy birthday,’ Rio said softly, pulse skipping in her neck.</p><p>Agatha blushed, picking up Nicky for something to do with her hands.</p><p>‘Why didn-’ Rio began, at the very same moment Agatha said ‘Ralph and I-’</p><p>‘Sorry,’ Agatha smiled at her kindly. ‘You go.’</p><p>Rio hated the whiny tone which came out her mouth. ‘Why didn’t you tell me it was your birthday?’</p><p>Agatha looked taken aback. ‘I didn’t think you’d-, I mean, I didn’t know that you cared.’</p><p>A beat.</p><p>‘I do care.’ Rio replied, speaking slowly to ensure Agatha took her meaning. ‘<em>I care</em>.’</p><p>The moment was broken by Ralph entering the room, wearing leggings for some unexplained reason.</p><p>‘Oh, hey Rio. Agatha and I are taking the day off work, we’ll be back at 5. Big 4-0, you know how it is.’</p><p>Ralph pronounced 40 like ‘four-oh’, and the very action of it annoyed Rio.</p><p>‘Yeah, no problem. We’ll have fun, right Nick?’</p><p>Rio kept her eyes on Nicky and jammed her hand into her back pocket to grip her phone for something to squeeze. Nicky dropped out of Agatha’s arms and crossed the room to her, taking her hand solemnly.</p><p>Even the six-year-old could sense the uncomfortable energy in the room.</p><p>Rio and Nicky watched them get in the car and drive away from the living room window, knees tucked up and pressed together on the sofa. Rio didn’t know why her stomach had sunk so low.</p><p>‘What shall we do then, bud?’ she asked Agatha’s little boy.</p><p>He tipped his head back and regarded her from beneath his eyelashes, in an expression that reminded Rio of his mom.</p><p>‘Let’s make Mama a birthday cake.’</p><hr/><p>The light in Agatha’s eyes that had been there on her birthday morning was dead and gone when she got back with Ralph.</p><p>He seemed totally unaware, undeserving arm slung around her shoulders.</p><p>Nestled at Agatha’s throat was a necklace that hadn’t been there this morning, a gaudy letter ‘R’, studded with diamantes.</p><p>Rio berated herself for the traitorous twist in her chest.</p><p>‘Mama!’ Nicky flung himself at her.</p><p>‘Me and Rio made you a cake!’</p><p>Agatha beamed, cradling her son’s face in her hands. ‘Really?’</p><p>Her eyes snapped up from Nicky’s to Rio’s and they softened.</p><p><em>Thank you</em>, she mouthed at Rio, a secret message just for her.</p><p>Instantly, the four hours of stress, mess and Nicky’s sugar high from licking the icing spoon were worth it.</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the pink tinging her cheeks as she shyly showed Agatha their cake. It was chocolate, with vanilla buttercream frosting slathered all over it, and Nicky’s messy drawl reading ‘Mama is 40!’. His choice.</p><p>Rio had added her own little touches, a dusting of edible glitter to represent Agatha’s spirituality, and she had even spent Nicky’s nap time, tweezers in hand, picking out every purple and green heart from the sprinkles to decorate the edges. They were Agatha’s favourite colours.</p><p>Silently, under the table, she felt Agatha’s hand take hers, and she laced their fingers together for a quick squeeze. Rio’s traitorous heart lurched.</p><p>Ralph walked in and Agatha dropped her hand like a hot stone.</p><p>Rio hadn’t taken a single bite of cake yet, but she felt violently sick.</p><hr/><p>An hour later, and the cake was demolished in the centre of the table. Agatha had let Nicky cut it up, and he’d just scooped servings out in random places. The effect was that it looked like someone had punched directly through the centre of it.</p><p>Rio checked her phone with a tiny bit of apprehension. It was nearing 6.30, and she’d officially finished ‘work’ at 5. Alice would be wondering where she was.</p><p>Making conversation with Nicky’s parents was pleasant enough, but a completely different experience to talking to Agatha one-on-one. It was like she had several walls up in front of Ralph that weren’t there alone. Rio wondered if she ever let them down around him.</p><p>‘Rio,’ Agatha addressed her suddenly, breaking her out of her reverie.</p><p>‘Would you like a glass of wine?’ she asked, gesturing towards the kitchen.</p><p>‘Uh-,’ Rio hesitated, checking her phone again. ‘Yeah, that would be nice. I’ve just got to text my flatmate.’</p><p>Agatha nodded and pushed back from the table to get the drinks from the kitchen. She caught Rio’s eyes and inclined them very subtly and slightly towards the open door.</p><p>Rio caught her drift immediately, springing up herself and shooting a quick text to Alice as she did.</p><p>
<em>Back late </em>
</p><p>Alice sent back the eye-roll emoji.</p><p>
<em>Bring back dinner.</em>
</p><p>Rio smirked and pocketed her phone. Agatha was hovering by her chair, and she cleared her throat.</p><p>‘Uh- let me help you with glasses,’ Rio said, trying for a casual tone.</p><p>Ralph was oblivious, talking to Nicky about something in an obnoxious baby voice, completely inappropriate for the boy’s age.</p><p>Rio followed behind Agatha, waiting in the doorway as she reached up to the cupboard to pull down three wine glasses. Her shirt rode up at her lower back as she did.</p><p>Rio went to the fridge and took out the wine, swallowing against the tension simmering between them.</p><p>She brought the wine over to where Agatha was standing, watching her. Her fingers were clasped around her necklace, worrying at it where it lay against her skin.</p><p>‘Nice necklace,’ Rio offered lamely.</p><p>Agatha gave her a sharp look and dropped it.</p><p>‘I hate it.’</p><p>To Rio’s great surprise, tears welled up in the corner of her eyes. She stood there frozen, unsure of what to do.</p><p>‘Hey-’ she began, and Agatha let out a quiet shushing noise Rio had heard her use on Nicky. The older woman swayed forward as if she’d already had a glass or two. Then, without ceremony, she leaned her forehead against Rio’s shoulder, allowing her to support Agatha’s body weight.</p><p>Rio froze, then recovered, threading her fingers into Agatha’s hair and pulling her close into a hug. At the first touch of her hair, Agatha moaned, a tiny broken noise into Rio’s ear, just for her.</p><p>‘Thank you,’ Agatha whispered, hot breath fanning out over Rio’s neck.</p><p>‘I’m sorry.’ Rio heard herself say. She felt very far away from her body.</p><p>‘For what?’</p><p>Agatha turned her head as she asked the question, the tip of her nose touching Rio’s neck, right where her pulse point was hammering.</p><p>‘Uh-,’ Rio’s voice came out strangled. ‘I didn’t get you a present.’</p><p>Agatha smiled, and Rio felt rather than saw it.</p><p>‘You did.’ Agatha said. ‘You did.’</p><hr/><p>When Rio got home, Chinese food held out in front of her like a peace offering, Alice regarded her with a stern look.</p><p>‘Rio…’ she said, gesturing at the mirror in the hallway. ‘Look at yourself.’</p><p>Rio flinched, handing Alice the food, unwrapping her scarf and turning to stare at her reflection.</p><p>Her eyes were wide and bright, lit up like she had been watching fireworks.</p><p>The November cold, a day of blushes and her glass of wine had stained her cheeks permanently pink, and she was getting lines by her eyes from smiling so hard.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked over to Alice’s in the mirror.</p><p>‘Be careful, okay?’ her friend admonished.</p><p>Rio nodded, but secretly she thought it might be too late.</p><hr/><p>Rio was helping Nicky into his puffer coat when Agatha came down the stairs, brow creased with stress.</p><p>‘Hey,’ Rio said, smiling up at her. ‘We’re just heading to the park.’</p><p>Agatha nodded distractedly, pulling out her phone.</p><p>Rio swallowed down the rebuttal, busying herself with slipping Nicky’s shoes on, one welly at a time. She was so focused she didn’t notice Agatha jamming her own feet into trainers and pulling on a jacket.</p><p>‘Let’s go.’ Agatha said, a statement not a question.</p><p>Rio caught the serious tone in her words.</p><p>‘Yes ma’am!’ she joked, saluting at Agatha’s back to make Nicky laugh.</p><p>Nicky was beside himself with excitement, insisting on holding both Agatha and Rio’s hands, one each.</p><p>They walked down the pavement as a trio, occasionally using their combined strength to swing Nicky into the air.</p><p>‘You ok?’ Rio ventured, catching Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>The right side of her mouth was downturned slightly, and her tooth kept sneaking out to bite at her lip.</p><p>Agatha levelled a look at her, wordlessly answering.</p><p>Rio turned her attention back to Agatha’s son. If she wouldn’t talk about what was wrong, Rio would just make sure she had a ton of fun.</p><p>The park was pretty close to desolate when they got there, freezing air keeping the children at bay. There were a couple of older kids throwing a ball around, bundled up with scarves and hats.</p><p>Nicky dropped their hands, running straight for the swings. Rio couldn’t suppress her smile at his clear joy. She turned to Agatha, trying to share the moment, but her boss wasn’t looking back, eyes fixed on her son and a wistful smile playing at her lips.</p><p>‘Mama! Rio!’ called Nicky.</p><p>They reached the swings and Rio began to push Nicky, out of habit.</p><p>Agatha didn’t join in, simply standing there with her hands tucked into her pockets, gazing off into the distance.</p><p><em>You are so beautiful, </em>Rio thought, trying hard to will the sentence into Agatha’s head. This was something she did often. Far more often than she should.</p><p>‘Let’s play house!’ Nicky cheered, racing for the little clubhouse in the centre of the park.</p><p>Rio followed him, not checking behind her so she didn’t seem so desperate for Agatha’s attention.</p><p>She crouched down next to the house that Nicky had already entered and peered through the window at him.</p><p>‘Knock, knock!’ she said jovially, pretending to knock at the door and delighting Nicky.</p><p>He was busying himself with something on the floor, fiddling with it.</p><p>Rio glanced around her shoulder and saw that Agatha looked more present now, watching them with a barely-there smile.</p><p>‘Mama,’ Nicky called, leaning out of the mini-window.</p><p>‘Here’s your ring,’ he said, presenting Agatha with the stalk of a leaf tied up to form a circle.</p><p>Agatha’s face lit up, the way only Nicky could make it, and she slipped it onto her fourth finger on her left hand, right over her wedding band.</p><p>‘Rio,’ came the voice from inside the house, and Rio’s heart did a funny little leap. She thought she knew what this game was.</p><p>‘Your ring, Rio.’ Nicky said solemnly, passing Rio an identical leaf stalk.</p><p>She mirrored Agatha’s actions, pushing it up her finger until it rested by her knuckle.</p><p>‘Nicky?’ Agatha broke the silence.</p><p>‘Yes, Mama?’ came the reply, Nicky’s head poking out of the window.</p><p>‘Are me and Rio married in this game?’</p><p>Nicky beamed. ‘Yes.’</p><p>Rio was blushing <em>so</em> stupidly hard, eyes trained on the ground.</p><p>Now Agatha had found Nicky out, he would not shut up. His next words made Rio’s stomach drop to her toes.</p><p>‘Rio wants you,’ he stated matter-of-factly, peering up at his mom, child’s mind not understanding the layered meaning of the words.</p><p>‘Uh-’ Rio stammered, clearing her throat like a fish out of water.</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow, smirking at Rio’s hot cheeks.</p><p>‘Oh, really?’</p><p>Nicky nodded seriously, looking between them.</p><p>‘She told me.’</p><p>Rio suddenly felt very sick. She knew what Nicky was talking about.</p><p>Last week, he had been having a rare temper tantrum, kicking out against Rio and screaming for Agatha. They had been home alone, so Rio had no choice but to calm him on her own.</p><p>After ten minutes or so of holding the boy while he cried, he finally calmed down enough to talk.</p><p>‘I want Mama,’ he had sobbed, his tears soaking Rio’s hoodie.</p><p>Rio had held him tight, rocking him back and forth on her lap.</p><p>‘Me too, buddy. Your mama’s amazing. Best mama in the world.’</p><p>Never in her life did she think Nicky had even understood her, let alone remembered those whispered words.</p><p>Agatha’s face was bright with the first real positive emotion Rio had seen on it all day.</p><p>She leaned in close to Rio, practically purring as she teased her. A lock of her hair was tangled in her jacket zip, and it was too much.</p><p>‘<em>Do</em> tell.’</p><p>Rio’s skin felt like it was being warmed in front of a furnace, and she cursed her tendency to blush. She opened and closed her mouth, unable to come up with anything to say.</p><p>Agatha just <em>kept fucking teasing.</em></p><p>‘No, go on. What did you tell my son?’</p><p>Rio’s mouth shut hard and she tore at the stalk around her finger, dropping the imaginary ring to the ground.</p><p>‘I was just comforting him, okay?’ she snapped, words coming out a bit harsher than she’d intended.</p><p>Agatha’s face flashed with something that looked like hurt, and Nicky stared between them.</p><p>‘You can go early, if you want.’ Agatha said, all lightness gone from her tone. ‘I’ll take him home.’</p><p>Rio swallowed down the sudden bile threatening to rise from her throat.</p><p>‘Great, thanks.’ She knelt down and ruffled Nicky’s hair. ‘Bye, kid.’</p><p>She turned on her heel and walked away, without another word, blood simmering hot under her skin.</p><p>What the fuck was <em>that</em>?</p><hr/><p>Rio spends all weekend in bed.</p><p>She can’t stop thinking about what happened in the park, and she has decided to make it everybody’s problem. And for her, everybody is Alice.</p><p>‘Why hasn’t she textedddd?’ Rio groaned, leaning her head back against her pillow.</p><p>Alice was perched at the end of her bed, cross-legged, knees poking out through the rips in her jeans.</p><p>‘Dude, stop.’</p><p>‘I’m sorry but, surely she was in the wrong in that situation?’</p><p>‘Rio, we’ve been through this over fifty times.’</p><p>‘Ugh.’ Rio threw a teddy at Alice’s head. ‘You’re no help.’</p><p>‘If only she would-’ Rio’s phone buzzes, and she’s on it like a flash.</p><p>‘Ohmygod.’</p><p>‘Let me guess,’ Alice deadpanned, so done with Rio’s shit. ‘She texted.’</p><p>She had.</p><p>
<em>Hey Rio, hope you’ve had a nice weekend. I’m sorry about Friday, Nicky can be a wind-up sometimes. Would you like to babysit for us Monday evening?</em>
</p><p>Rio scoffed. ‘She blamed it on the fucking kid.’</p><p>‘Lemme see.’ Alice reached for her phone, skimming quickly over the text.</p><p>‘Look, she’s apologised, you can both move on.’ Then she winced, looking up at her best friend. ‘Date night Monday?’</p><p>Rio mock-gagged, hiding her disappointment.</p><p>‘At least I’ll see her looking hot,’ she smirked.</p><p>‘Yeah, for <em>him</em>.’</p><p>Rio’s face hardened.</p><p>‘Fuck you, Alice.'</p><p>Alice raised her hands up, palms out in surrender, backing out of the room.</p><p>‘Just keeping it real. You’re digging your own grave, Vidal.’</p><p>Rio scoffed, phone buzzing for a second time.</p><p>It was Agatha again, and she’d sent a link.</p><p>
<em>P.S This reminded me of you</em>
</p><p>It was a link to an article about flower language. Rio flushed in spite of herself. Her poppies and lilies were on there, as well as her third tattoo, the one Agatha didn’t know about.</p><p>Red rose – for passion and lust.</p><p>The thought of Agatha reading that made Rio’s stomach flip hard.</p><hr/><p>Rio showed up at exactly 6.47 pm on Monday night.</p><p>God showed her the tiniest bit of grace in sending Ralph to answer the door, to give her a moment to collect herself.</p><p>‘Hey, Rio. Good weekend?’ Ralph asked over his shoulder as he went into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio let herself in, kicking off her shoes and closing the door behind her.</p><p>‘Yep!’ she replied, a little too chirpily, tone betraying her anxiety.</p><p>She levelled her gaze at Ralph’s retreating back, narrowing her eyes and trying to send a telepathic message.</p><p>
<em>I hate you so much.</em>
</p><p>‘Nick’s in bed, and the wife is just settling him. We’ll be off in five, so make yourself at home.’</p><p>Rio hummed her thanks, then turned around and rolled her eyes hard at the wall. The way Ralph talked about Agatha was disgusting.</p><p>She was walking to the sofa on her phone, reading some stupid tweet Alice had sent her, when her chest collided with something solid and warm. Her phone dropped to the floor, clatter loud in the quiet house.</p><p>‘Oh shit-,’</p><p>‘I’m so sorry,’ Agatha’s warm hands gripped Rio’s elbows.</p><p>‘I wasn’t looking where I was going. Is your phone okay?’</p><p>This last was said as Agatha bent down to the floor to pick it up, affording Rio a pretty fucking perfect view down the front of her black dress. Her bra was red.</p><p>Rio drew in a shaky inhale as Agatha straightened back up, face tinged pink from the sudden change in blood flow.</p><p>She was devastatingly gorgeous.</p><p>Her skin was bare and clean, lashes long and thick with mascara, and lips painted a deep red. Rio couldn’t stop staring at them.</p><p>‘Uh-,’ she tried, forcing her eyes back up to Agatha’s blue ones.</p><p>‘You look-,’</p><p>
<em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p><em> </em>‘Agatha,’ and her voice was steady now, clear and low, just for Agatha’s ears. ‘You look amazing.’</p><p>Agatha dipped her head in a self-deprecating smile and opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, they were interrupted by Ralph’s baritone behind them.</p><p>‘You wore that dress last time,’ Ralph said, tone caught in that space between serious and teasing.</p><p>Rio’s fist clenched with the effort of keeping her hand at her side.</p><p><em>‘Ralph,’</em> Agatha reprimanded, and good for her, talking back to the piece of shit.</p><p>‘Just joking, my love.’</p><p>Rio looked pointedly down at her phone as Ralph drew Agatha into a painfully awkward side-hug and grasped her hand like a child clawing at an iPad.</p><p>‘Bye,’ Rio said noncommittally, refusing to tear her eyes away from her phone as the couple backed out of the front door.</p><p>There was a crack splitting her screen in two from camera to midway down, where she rested her thumb.</p><p>She found she did not mind.</p><hr/><p>Rio stayed on the sofa for an hour, scrolling through the Harkness family Disney+ profiles, stupid lovesick heart staring at Agatha’s profile, looking at what she was watching.</p><p>Then curiosity won out.</p><p>Before she could think better of it, she headed upstairs, plausible deniability telling herself she was going to the bathroom.</p><p>But instead of making a right before Nicky’s bedroom, she turned the corner after the stairs, and pushed open the door of Agatha and Ralph’s bedroom.</p><p>The left side of the space was almost bare, uncluttered and plain. Must be Ralph’s.</p><p>Agatha’s side was a mess in a way that made total sense for its owner.</p><p>Nicky’s toys and books littered the floor, and the bed was unmade.</p><p>Several dresses were draped over the chair, presumably Agatha’s rejects for date night.</p><p>A feeling of dread crept into Rio’s stomach, and she began to back away.</p><p>
<em>What the fuck was she doing?</em>
</p><p>Right before she left the room, she saw two things.</p><p>Agatha’s eye mask, peeking out from under her pillow.</p><p>And on the bedside table, a book Rio had recommended to her.</p><hr/><p>When they got back, Ralph was drunk.</p><p>Rio had listened for three minutes to the sound of keys jingling and jamming in the lock before she took pity on them and got up to open the door from the inside.</p><p>‘Hey.’</p><p>Ralph surged in as soon as she’d undone the door latch.</p><p>‘Rio!’ Spoken too loudly, too excitedly.</p><p>‘Shh,’ Rio said, holding her index finger to her lips. ‘Wouldn’t want to wake Nicky.’</p><p>‘Oh, right, of course. Well, I’m heading up. Agatha will see you out.’</p><p>With that, he turned and started up the stairs, swaying with the effort.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath and turned around.</p><p>Agatha was watching her from the doorway, eyes dark and a little wild. Rio let the moment drag out, tension simmering between them like a live wire. Agatha was the one to break the silence.</p><p><em>‘Rio,</em>’ she whispered, and the way she said it made Rio’s entire lower body spark with heat.</p><p>Rio stood there staring, then took a step closer.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, pressing herself into the door, tipping her chin up as if to dare Rio to enter her space.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio replied in kind, struggling to keep her voice level.</p><p>Another step forward, and this close she could see smudges on Agatha’s face. It took her a second to realise it was her lipstick smeared where Ralph had kissed her.</p><p>This brought Rio to a violent halt, and she leaned a palm on the wall to steady herself, a kind of protection from the woman in front of her.</p><p>‘I’m gonna call an Uber.’ Rio stated, offering Agatha the chance to pretend nothing was happening.</p><p>‘Okay,’ Agatha said in a small voice. ‘I’ll wait down here with you.’</p><p>Rio booked an Uber. 4 minutes away.</p><p>She shrugged on her jacket and zipped it up, bending down awkwardly to slip her shoes on, which brought her face to face with Agatha’s knees.</p><p>From down here, Rio could see her inner thighs.</p><p>She made a tiny noise of exertion and/or want as she hauled herself back up, and Agatha was really not making that much of an effort not to stare.</p><p>‘Uh- it’s um- two minutes away, so I’m gonna-’</p><p>Rio gestured for the door, stepping close to Agatha for a second as she made to open it.</p><p>‘Oh, right yes, sorry.’</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the way, body brushing Rio’s arm for the barest second before she was gone.</p><p>Rio turned around to say bye, but Agatha was right behind her still, just a few inches too close.</p><p>With her heels on, their mouths were level.</p><p>‘I’ll come out and wait with you.’</p><p>The door shut with an audible click as Agatha and Rio stepped out into the cold, Agatha’s arms instantly sneaking up to hug herself.</p><p>‘Seriously, it’s fine,’ Rio tried to protest. ‘You’re cold.’</p><p>A hand reached up to Agatha’s bare arm to accentuate her point by tracing her gooseflesh, but her fingers lingered on the hot skin.</p><p>Agatha caught her eyes, a dangerous look passing between them.</p><p>Rio was terrified the other woman would say something that would break her resolve and make her press Agatha up against the door and cover her mouth with her own. Even her name in that breathy voice again would suffice.</p><p>But when she did speak it was with a voice momentarily free from lust.</p><p>‘I don’t love him.’ Agatha said simply, at the very same moment a car pulled up on the gravel in front of them.</p><p>Before Rio could respond, she had turned back around.</p><p>‘Goodnight Rio.’</p><p>She was inside the house seconds later, and Rio inside the taxi that was taking her home. As it should be.</p><hr/><p>When Rio turned up at the Harkness house, two weeks before Christmas, all the lights were off in the living room except for the glow emanating from the tree.</p><p>Agatha opened the door to her, smiling instantly when she saw Rio.</p><p>‘Hi,’ she said sweetly, almost shy with it.</p><p>‘Hey,’ Rio responded, heart in her throat.</p><p>Agatha was bare-faced, clad in flannel pyjama pants and an oversized jumper. There were three holes in it at the neckline. Her hair was up in a ponytail that looked as if it had been neat when fresh, but had been lain on for an hour or so.</p><p>‘Okay, so, Nicky isn’t feeling super well today, and Ralph is away for work, so I thought I could use a second pair of hands.’</p><p>Agatha was talking over her shoulder, already walking into the living room, where the multicoloured lights on the tree reflected onto her face in the dark.</p><p>Rio turned the corner and clutched her hands to her chest dramatically when she saw Nicky. He was bundled up in multiple blankets, his favourite furry one and even the electric one Rio had taken to reading under in her lunch breaks.</p><p>In front of him was a plate stacked high with toast and various bits of half-nibbled fruit.</p><p>‘Rioooo,’ he whined. ‘I’m sick.’</p><p>‘I see that, buddy.’</p><p>Rio crossed the room to ruffle his hair.</p><p>‘So, what are we watching?’</p><p>Rio expected Agatha to go upstairs then, get ready for her day and leave her caring for Nicky. To her surprise and delight, Agatha slipped under the heated blanket, socked toes peeking out where it was angled wrong.</p><p>Rio joined her in silence, skin thrumming with the delicious thrill of time spent alone with Agatha.</p><p>She couldn’t stop smiling, lips quirking up every time she thought about the fact Agatha had essentially wanted to invite her for a movie day.</p><p>They sat either side of the little boy, whose occasional sneezing and coughing broke the silence. They were watching Frozen, and Nicky was enraptured.</p><p>‘I love this movie.’ Agatha said quietly, turning to Rio above Nicky’s head.</p><p>‘Same, I was like, totally in love with Elsa when I was younger.’</p><p>Rio blushed at her admission, at the allusion to her interest in women.</p><p>‘Elsa, huh?’ Agatha teased. ‘You like a blonde?’</p><p>Rio smirked.</p><p>‘Not lately.’</p><p>Now it was Agatha’s turn for flushed cheeks, and she glanced away, down at her lap.</p><p>They refocused on the movie, the opening notes of ‘<em>Let it Go</em>’ filtering through the sound system and making Nicky bounce with excitement.</p><p>‘I love this part!’</p><p>Rio was ridiculously endeared by Agatha singing along under her breath.</p><p>At the climax of the song, when Elsa tosses her crown to the side and undoes her hair, Rio shifted to whisper to Agatha.</p><p>‘This part had little me going crazy.’</p><p>As she did, her arm dropped down to half-encircle Nicky’s head, half lean against the top of the sofa. Her fingertips brushed Agatha’s ponytail and she pulled her hand back as if she’d been burned.</p><p>With stoic calmness, Agatha reached behind her and caught Rio’s hand, drawing it back around her and Nicky, gaze fixed pointedly on the screen.</p><p>Rio’s stomach gave a sick lurch, and suddenly Elsa was the last thing on her mind.</p><p>She kept her hand heroically still for five whole minutes before moving her thumb the tiniest bit, an experiment. It brushed the back of Agatha’s neck, where her hair was drawn up and off her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha exhaled the barest puff of air, and Rio pressed more firmly, very deliberately stroking her neck now.</p><p>Agatha moved, and Rio braced herself for the sting of rejection, but she was simply tipping her neck to the left, allowing Rio more skin.</p><p>Rio whimpered inaudibly, shifting against the sudden pulse between her legs.</p><p><em>Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, </em>her brain supplied helpfully.</p><p>She chanced a look down at Nicky, who was fast asleep. Before she could overthink it, she withdrew her hand. Agatha’s eyes met hers, wide and dark with something Rio hadn’t seen in them since that night she’d been drunk at the door, now softening into hurt.</p><p>‘I’m gonna put Nicky in bed.’</p><p>Agatha could only nod, readjusting her position on the sofa.</p><p>‘Okay.’</p><p>Rio dashed up the stairs two at a time, a sleeping Nicky in her arms. She took a moment to tuck him into bed, making sure he had his favourite teddy in his arms, and drawing the duvet up to his neck.</p><p>‘Sweet dreams, kiddo.’</p><p>She practically flew down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha was sitting right where she left her, gaze on the screen where Anna and Kristoff were riding in the sleigh together.</p><p>Rio settled back under the blanket silently.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, and Rio was terrified she’d ruined the moment forever.</p><p>Five painful, tense minutes later, Rio’s hand found its way round the back of the couch again, fingertips just barely tracing Agatha’s shoulder, over her jumper.</p><p>Agatha shifted closer, making Rio’s thumb press into her neck again.</p><p>Her fingers curled round something hard and cool. Ralph’s necklace.</p><p>Rio picked up the ‘R’, turning it over in her hand. The bottom was warmed through from Agatha’s skin. She gave it a sharp tug, drawing a gasp out of Agatha.</p><p>‘It drives me crazy seeing you wear this.’</p><p>The subtext was clear. The R was for Rio now.</p><p><em>‘Rio,’</em> Agatha said, low and breathy, reaching under the blanket to grasp Rio’s other hand in her own.</p><p>Rio’s entire palm came up to hold the back of her neck, and she slipped down the sofa until her lips were ghosting over Agatha’s skin.</p><p>She squeezed Agatha’s hand, once and hard, desperate for some confirmation from the older woman.</p><p>Agatha squeezed back, and Rio’s mouth made hot contact with her neck.</p><p>An instant moan spilled from her lips, and she began to pant gently.</p><p><em>‘Fuck,’</em> Agatha groaned as Rio’s fingers curled into her ponytail, exposing her neck further.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio whispered against her skin. ‘You have no idea how badly I-’</p><p>Nicky began to cry from upstairs.</p><p>Agatha was up and standing by the door like a shot, eyes trained on the wall in front of her.</p><p>‘Rio, I should- uh- you can see yourself out. See you soon, okay?’</p><p>Rio walked home with her underwear hot and wet against her cold skin.</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio hears nothing for three days and is just about hanging onto her final scrap of dignity and self-control when Agatha finally texts. She’s archived and unarchived their chat a hundred times in some sort of half-hearted way to get some power back, so she doesn’t see the message straight away.</p><p>When she clicks on her archived messages, sick hope rising in her chest once again, she nearly drops her phone. She still hasn’t had the screen fixed from when Agatha cracked it.</p><p>Agatha has written this:</p><p>
<em>Sorry, N is still sick. See you next week </em>
</p><p>No emoji, no kiss, not even a full stop.</p><p>Rio melts into a puddle on the floor. It’s clear that Agatha regrets everything that happened between them and is trying to find a way to let her go gently.</p><p>She archives the message, tears burning at the corner of her eyes.</p><p>
<em>Fuck Agatha.</em>
</p><p>This situation was just as much her as it was Rio.</p><p>‘Alice,’ Rio called from her position on the floor. Her head was lying half on a throw pillow, and half on the chocolate wrapper she had misery-eaten last night.</p><p>Her best friend’s head ducked round the corner.</p><p>‘Yep?’</p><p>One look at Rio’s crumpled face revealed all.</p><p>‘Oh, Rio.’</p><p>She came into Rio’s room, crouching next to her and sliding the pillow under her head completely.</p><p>‘The boss again?’ she probed gently.</p><p>Rio choked back a sob-scream and turned her face into the cool fabric.</p><p>She said nothing, didn’t trust her own voice right now.</p><p>Alice lay down next to her, tucking Rio’s hair behind her ear and planting an overdramatic kiss on her forehead.</p><p>‘There, there,’ she whispered, cradling Rio in her arms.</p><p>Rio didn’t even have the heart to pretend it was Agatha holding her this way.</p><hr/><p>Tuesday morning, and Rio’s stomach was sick with nerves.</p><p>It was her first time seeing Agatha since she’d kissed her neck, a memory she replayed over and over in the days since.</p><p>It was clear from the older woman’s text demeanour that she wanted to forget about the whole thing, but Rio needed to see her to be sure.</p><p>Instead of waiting upstairs to catch her eye as she came in from yoga, Rio took Nicky into the garden to play. She knew Agatha would try to avoid her, and she wanted to catch her off guard.</p><p>And she did.</p><p>Agatha had just barely got the gate open when Rio was in front of her, Nicky distracted with his tractor on the grass.</p><p>‘Hi.’</p><p>Agatha jumped, widened eyes flicking to the window out of habit.</p><p>She was wearing a purple jumper over her workout clothes, hair up in a ponytail just like when Rio last saw her.</p><p>‘Rio…’</p><p>Rio waited patiently, crossing her arms. Here it comes.</p><p>‘I can’t-’</p><p>Rio cut her off. ‘I was so sorry to hear about Nicky being so sick all week.’</p><p>Nicky looked up.</p><p>‘I was only sick for a day. Silly Rio.’</p><p>Rio smirked, having caught Agatha in her lie.</p><p>Agatha’s hand found her elbow, drawing her in close so she could speak lowly into her ear.</p><p>‘Not here, Rio, okay?’</p><p>Rio hated how her breath hitched at their close proximity, and the warmth of Agatha’s breath on the side of her neck.</p><p>‘Where?’ Rio hissed, pulling away until their eyes met.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, just shook her head almost imperceptibly, and walked past Rio to her son.</p><p>‘Nicky, baby!’</p><p>She gave his hair a ruffle before continuing into the house without a backward glance.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio called after her. ‘Where?’</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn around.</p><hr/><p>Days passed in a kind of haze for Rio, her Biology studies completely disregarded as she tried to handle how she was feeling about Agatha.</p><p>She was barely eating, barely sleeping, barely able to function, and Alice was worried.</p><p>Rio began to loiter around all the places she knew Agatha frequented, her favourite shops and cafés. She would wake up early, spend an hour getting ready – making herself up perfectly in case she ran into Agatha.</p><p>On Friday, Rio woke up at 6 to start getting ready. She chose a black button up and mini skirt with a deep red blazer, tights and boots. She lined her eyes with kohl, put in chunky gold hoops and rolled her shirt up until it exposed the tattoo on her wrist.</p><p>She was going to try and catch Agatha at a coffee shop she’d told Rio about just two weeks ago.</p><p>It was fairly new, the coffee was good and strong, and it was still unknown enough that the queue wasn’t out the door.</p><p>The café opened at 8, and Rio was outside at 7:58. Waiting.</p><p>As soon as the sign was turned to ‘Open’, Rio headed inside, ordering an oat latte and going to sit at the back of the shop where she had a perfect view of the door.</p><p>Agatha was right, the coffee was good. Each time the bell above the door rang to signal a new customer, Rio’s head snapped up in anticipation. Her neck was starting to hurt.</p><p>At 8:40, her coffee was long gone and she was starting to give up, gathering her blazer from the back of her chair to go home.</p><p>At 8:41, Agatha walked in.</p><p>Rio sat back down abruptly, chair scraping with the force of her weight.</p><p>The café wasn’t empty anymore, but it was still quiet enough that the noise drew Agatha’s attention to her. Rio braced herself for the rebuff, but Agatha’s face broke into an easy smile, and she crossed the room to her in three quick strides.</p><p>‘Rio, thank god.’</p><p>Rio stared at her, stunned. <em>J</em><em>esus, she’s so beautiful.</em></p><p>She was wearing a cream pullover and navy slacks, cropped just above her ankle. Her gorgeous wavy hair was down, spilling all over her shoulders.</p><p>At Rio’s failure to form a response, Agatha grinned, taking the seat next to hers gingerly.</p><p>‘Finally. I thought you’d never come.’</p><p>‘W-What?’ Rio eventually managed. ‘How’d you know I’d look for you here?’</p><p>Agatha’s smile widened, and she put on a silly witchy voice, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>‘I saw it in the leaves.’</p><p>Rio didn’t laugh.</p><p>‘Agatha, I’ve been going crazy-’</p><p>Agatha interrupted her. ‘You wanna go somewhere? To talk?’</p><p>Rio looked at her incredulously. ‘We are… somewhere.’</p><p>‘I don’t want to have this conversation in public, Rio.’</p><p>‘Ok, what about y-’</p><p>‘Not at mine, either. Come on.’</p><p>Agatha extended a hand to her, and Rio clasped onto it like a life raft.</p><hr/><p>They ended up in a hotel lobby, despite all Agatha’s insistence that she just wanted to ‘talk’.</p><p>Rio was hardly aware of what was happening, brain stuck on the feel of Agatha’s hand in hers, skipping back to it repeatedly like a broken record. When Agatha let go of her and gave her some space, they were in a single room. Agatha locked the door.</p><p>Rio stared at the bed in front of them, shaking.</p><p>Agatha guided her to the edge of the bed, before sitting down on the armchair opposite.</p><p>‘Look, Rio, relax. I just want to talk in private.’</p><p>Rio cleared her throat for the first time in the better part of half an hour.</p><p>‘Agatha. What are you doing?’</p><p>Agatha tipped her head back in the armchair until it hit the wall, exposing the plane of her throat to Rio’s greedy eyes.</p><p>‘I don’t know. I really don’t. You surprised me.’</p><p>‘You think you didn’t surprise me? I’m the one trying to earn a living here. Imagine <em>my </em>surprise when my new client’s mom is-’</p><p>Rio cut herself off, swallowing the rest of her sentence.</p><p>‘Is what?’ Agatha smirked at her, and Rio wanted nothing more to wipe it off.</p><p>‘Agatha, I have thought about nothing else but you for two months.’</p><p>Agatha simply stared, fingers tracing the pattern on the arm of the chair, eyes willing Rio to continue.</p><p>‘My flatmate has put a ban on any discussion of your hair.’</p><p>‘My hair?’ Agatha made a funny face, nose scrunching up. ‘What about my hair?’</p><p>Rio slipped off the edge of the bed and shuffled towards Agatha on her knees, not stopping until she was directly at her feet.</p><p>With a sharp inhale, she pushed herself up until they were at eye level, a breath away from each other’s mouths.</p><p>Agatha stared openly at her lips, pupils blackening.</p><p>Without a word, Rio smoothed her hands up Agatha’s thighs, squeezing her legs right below the beginning of her hips, continuing their ascent until she reached Agatha’s neck. When she had the older woman’s face cradled in her hands, she searched for permission in her gaze.</p><p>Agatha’s hands came up to cover her own, and Rio thought she’d push her away. But Agatha gave her hands a firm clasp, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>With that, Rio finally, <em>finally</em>, slid her fingers into Agatha’s hair, palms splayed. She barely suppressed a moan as she got two big fistfuls of it, not pulling, just holding it reverently.</p><p>Her thumbs stroked Agatha’s scalp as her nose bumped forward to inhale at her hairline, just like she’d dreamed about. She told Agatha this.</p><p>‘I dreamed about this.’</p><p>‘You dreamed about me?’</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened on Agatha’s hair, pulling slightly at the roots, making her gasp into the space between their mouths.</p><p>‘I don’t dream about anything else.’</p><p>‘Rio-’ Agatha heaved out. ‘Let go, please.’</p><p>Rio withdrew her hands like she’d been burned. ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I thought-’</p><p>‘You can’t touch me, okay? I can’t touch you. Because of Ralph, and Nicky. Do you understand?’</p><p>Rio’s entire world shattered. She swallowed hard against the lump in her throat. ‘Agatha-’</p><p>‘But that doesn’t mean I can’t watch you.’</p><p>Agatha settled back into the armchair, gesturing towards the bed.</p><p>‘Rio, please. Show me what you do when you dream about me.’</p><p>Rio turned silently, hands shaking as she unbuttoned her blazer and sat back down on the bed.</p><p>‘Agatha, are you sure?’</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were trained on her fingers where they were undoing her final button.</p><p>‘Please.’</p><p>Rio pushed the blazer off her shoulders and lifted her shirt up in one fell movement. She was wearing a black bra, embossed with lace, and Agatha let out the barest whimper when she saw it.</p><p>She thumbed open the button of her skirt, at her hip.</p><p>‘Leave that on.’</p><p>Rio flushed, but did as she was told, sliding her tights down her tan legs, Agatha swallowing up every uncovered inch.</p><p>Finally, she kicked off her boots into the usual haphazard pile, leaving her clad in only her bra and miniskirt.</p><p>‘Okay,’ Agatha breathed, voice wavering. ‘Now flip your skirt up.’</p><p>Rio’s face was burning as she did so, revealing pink cotton panties to Agatha’s hungry eyes. In the middle of them was the beginnings of a wet spot.</p><p>‘Jesus,’ whispered Agatha.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, and somehow found the will to speak.</p><p>‘No, just me.’</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicked up to hers, and Rio was dumbfounded by the look of pure want written all over it.</p><p>‘Show me.’ Agatha demanded, leaning forward now, chin resting on her hands, elbows on her knees.</p><p>Rio snaked her hand down her body, trailing her fingers over her lower stomach as she stared at the woman in front of her. <em>Holy shit, this was really happening.</em><em> </em></p><p>Her fingers dipped under the waistband of her underwear, sliding home into wet heat, the shuddery gasp she made echoing in the soundless room.</p><p>‘<em>Agatha,’</em> she moaned, flopping back onto the bed until her head was just shy of the pillows, hand working at herself furiously, eyes screwed shut.</p><p>When she opened them, Agatha was standing over her at the edge of the bed, face full of wonder. She’d moved completely silently. Rio tore her hand away from herself, embarrassed, unsure.</p><p>‘Okay, new rules.’ Agatha’s voice was strangled, throaty. ‘I get to touch you.’</p><p>Rio tucked her hands underneath her back immediately, staring up at her in a show of total submission, making it clear she would obey.</p><p>The words were barely out of Agatha’s mouth before she was dropping down onto the bed, body covering Rio’s.</p><p>The sudden weight of the woman on top of her, breast to breast, made Rio moan.</p><p>‘Can I kiss you?’ she begged, arching up off the bed to press into Agatha further.</p><p>Agatha looked like she was considering it.</p><p>‘No kissing. Ralph-’</p><p>‘Don’t say his fucking name right now,’ Rio growled, baring her teeth at Agatha like a feral cat.</p><p>Agatha bit back a smirk. ‘How about this? You can touch my hair.’</p><p>Rio whined immediately, hands flying up to thread through Agatha’s hair for the second blessed time that morning.</p><p>
<em>Jesus, it probably wasn’t even 10am.</em>
</p><p>‘So beautiful,’ Rio whispered, fingers smoothing through it.</p><p>‘It’s just hair,’ Agatha smiled at her reverence.</p><p>Rio let go of it, curling her hands around Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>‘You’re beautiful.’</p><p>Agatha flushed, cheeks pinkening.</p><p>‘Less talking.’</p><p>Rio slammed her mouth shut, pretending to zip it up.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and smoothed her palm down the side of Rio’s neck, lowering her mouth to suck hotly at the bare skin.</p><p>Rio groaned, body writhing at the sensation.</p><p>‘Fuck, <em>please</em>.’</p><p>‘I’m getting there,’ Agatha said wryly against her skin, palming Rio’s chest. ‘Let’s get this off.’</p><p>Agatha slipped her fingers under Rio’s neck, using her entire right hand to raise her head and upper body off the bed, and the other to unclasp her bra in one swift motion.</p><p>She let go abruptly, and Rio thudded back down, breath leaving her in a whine.</p><p>Agatha was on her like a dog with a scent, tearing off her bra and flinging it to the side.</p><p>Instead of going straight for her nipples like Rio expected, Agatha lay down next to her, turning her over slightly to graze her hands up the side of her body.</p><p>‘Where is it?’ she rasped, scratching her nails lightly over Rio’s ribs.</p><p>Rio gasped, incapable of speech, rolling over to bare her other side to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha hummed, her warm hands squeezing at Rio’s side as she traced over the tattoo. Three red roses, black lines clear and dark against Rio’s overheated skin.</p><p>Agatha dropped her mouth to it, kissing each one before tracing a leaf with her tongue.</p><p>‘Beautiful.’</p><p>Rio gripped the back of her head, thighs pressed together and mouth twisted shut with the effort not to moan.</p><p>‘Agatha, please.’</p><p>Agatha smiled against her, turning her onto her back again and kissing over her stomach.</p><p>‘Let me take care of you, Rio.’</p><p>Rio gasped, sure she was dreaming, as Agatha unbuttoned her skirt and slid it down her legs, leaving her in her panties.</p><p>The wet spot was painfully visible now, soaking the entire gusset, slick escaping out to coat her inner thighs.</p><p>Agatha stared, dipping her head close and inhaling deeply.</p><p>‘For me?’</p><p>Rio whimpered, shifting uncomfortably where the cool air of the room made the damp fabric stick to her skin.</p><p>‘Please,’ she whispered, caressing Agatha’s head with all the softness she did not feel right now.</p><p>Without warning, Agatha’s head dipped down and planted a kiss on Rio’s underwear, right over her clit.</p><p><em>‘Fuck,’ </em>Rio whined, arching off the bed.</p><p>Agatha hooked her fingers under the waistband, drawing them down and off Rio’s body.</p><p>At the sight of Rio bare and wet beneath her, she heaved in a breath, face red and warm.</p><p>‘One sec.’</p><p>She withdrew, standing up again as she tore off her jumper, leaving her in just a white tank top, no bra, hard nipples pebbling the fabric. Rio stared, unable to tear her eyes off the lithe muscles in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>True to her word, in another second Agatha was back between her legs, hands holding Rio’s thighs apart.</p><p>‘Agatha, if you don’t touch me soon, I’ll probably come just from looking at you.’ Rio’s own voice surprised her, scratchy and low.</p><p>Agatha smirked wickedly, bent down and licked a careful stripe up Rio’s slit. She used her left thumb to lift her hood and unceremoniously sucked Rio’s entire clit into her mouth, making her scream and buck her hips up.</p><p>All of the hundreds of times Rio had imagined sex with Agatha, none of them had involved this. She always thought she’d be the one taking her apart, making her come with her mouth and fingers.</p><p>But Agatha had her on the edge within moments, licking and eating at her with total abandon, moaning against her overheated flesh.</p><p><em>‘Agatha,’ </em>Rio moaned, just to say her name again, and Agatha slid two fingers inside her, curling them hard until they found the spongy, ridged area that made Rio gasp.</p><p>She didn’t thrust in and out, simply rubbing the pads of her middle and fourth fingertips firmly against that spot, making Rio see stars as her tongue danced across her clit.</p><p>Rio felt her body seizing all too soon, and she tangled her fingers into Agatha’s hair to warn her, but Agatha just kept going, reaching up to grip Rio’s breast as she worked her over.</p><p>‘Gonna come,’ Rio managed to pant, seconds before the pleasure exploded in her lower belly, ripping through her like a violent wave as she ground down against Agatha’s fingers, soaking them completely.</p><p>Agatha kept fucking her through her orgasm, pinching her nipple to heighten the feeling, prolonging it as she gave Rio’s clit little kitten licks.</p><p>She didn’t stop until Rio tugged hard on her hair to bring her face away, chin smeared with slick, smile wild.</p><p>She curled against Rio to hold her through the aftershocks, murmuring in her ear as Rio trembled against her.</p><p>When she had come down enough to speak, Rio turned to face Agatha, eyes big and pleading.</p><p>‘Divorce him.’</p><p>Agatha laughed, wiping her chin with the back of her left hand.</p><p>‘Rio.’</p><p>‘No, I’m serious. Divorce him.’</p><p>When Agatha didn’t say anything, only smiling and tucking Rio’s hair behind her ear, she continued.</p><p>‘Agatha, you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen in my life, and that’s the least interesting thing about you. You deserve the best.’</p><p>‘And that’s you?’ Agatha teased, hiding her blush at Rio’s compliments.</p><p>‘No, no. I don’t deserve you. You’re perfect, Agatha. You’re a goddess.’</p><p>Rio cringed at herself, post-orgasm truth serum working its magic.</p><p>‘Careful, Rio,’ Agatha admonished, winking to show she was teasing, thumb brushing over Rio’s cheek.</p><p>‘If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you’ve fallen a little in love with me.’</p><p>Rio swallowed, gazing into blue eyes as she reached down to clasp Agatha’s left hand, bringing it up to her lips and sucking the fingers she’d just been fucked with into her mouth, playing for time.</p><p>Agatha moaned as Rio’s tongue curled around them, cleaning them up. When she was done, she had a response ready.</p><p>‘In love with your mouth, maybe,’ Rio deadpanned. That wasn’t your first time with a woman, was it.’ A statement, not a question.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks pinked, two high splotches of colour.</p><p>‘No.’</p><p>‘Who was she?’ Rio asked, instantly jealous.</p><p>‘It was a long time ago,’ Agatha sighed. ‘I was younger than you are now.’</p><p>‘Divorce him.’ Rio repeated, captivated by the woman next to her.</p><p>‘And what?’ Agatha rolled her eyes. ‘Shack up with my 26-year-old nanny?’</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, biting back the sting of hurt.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ she whispered. ‘You’re not going to like this.’</p><p>‘What now?’</p><p>‘I’m 25.’ Rio finished, smirking hard.</p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh.</p><p>‘Fuck, Rio. You’re so young.’</p><p>When Rio didn’t respond, she spoke again.</p><p>‘We’re not actually married, you know. Me and Ralph.’</p><p>Rio twisted in her arms to face her fully.</p><p>‘What?’</p><p>‘Didn’t you ever wonder why my name is still Harkness, and not Bohner?’</p><p>‘Bohner? Ralph’s surname is… <em>Bohner</em>?’</p><p>Rio couldn’t help it, she burst out laughing, making Agatha smile in return.</p><p>‘Jesus, Agatha, thank god you didn’t marry him.’</p><p>‘He’s not even Nicky’s real father.’</p><p>That made Rio start, and she scrambled up to lean against the headboard, pulling the sheets tight around herself.</p><p>‘What?’</p><p>‘I was pregnant when we met. I used a donor. Ralph came along, and he wanted to “help me out”. I was too hormonal and desperate to argue with him. That’s why this is complicated, Rio. He’s Nicky’s dad, he helped raise Nicky.’</p><p>‘So what, he’s your knight in shining armour or whatever? That’s a load of crap, Agatha, you shouldn’t stay with someone because they “helped you out”. You should be with someone who loves you, and who <em>you</em> love.’</p><p>Rio’s voice cracked on this last, and she looked away.</p><p>‘Rio,’ Agatha whispered, reaching for her.</p><p>‘Are you going to let me return the favour?’ Rio asked, gazing pointedly down at Agatha’s body, to the junction where her thighs were crossed to alleviate the pressure between them.</p><p>‘I’m sorry, Rio. I can’t cross that boundary right now.’</p><p>‘Boundary? You didn’t seem to care much for <em>boundaries</em>, when you were fucking me, oh, ten minutes ago?’ Rio’s voice was raised now, anger pushing through the cloud of hurt.</p><p>‘Rio, I’m sorry.’</p><p>Rio was up and out of the bed in a moment, pulling on her bra and doing it up behind her with a practiced hand.</p><p>‘Tell Nicky I’ll miss him. Call me when you’ve cut the crap.’</p><p>Another minute, Agatha staring up at her from the bed, face creased with emotion, eyes scrunching up as she held back tears.</p><p>Rio finished getting dressed, zipping up her boots with trembling hands. <em>What the fuck was she doing?</em><em> </em></p><p>But it was too late to take her words back, and with a regretful look over her shoulder at Agatha, she stepped out of the room, terrified she’d never see her again.</p><p>She was more than a little in love.</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio spent the next three weeks in varying stages of hysteria and grief.</p><p>The first week she spent crying her eyes out, heaving over the toilet as she made herself sick with heartache. Alice held her hair back every time, soothing her with gentle shushing noises.</p><p>Alice would tuck her into bed, trying to say the right thing, find the words to comfort Rio.</p><p>She alternated between consoling and stern.</p><p>‘Rio, you must have known you could never be with her.’</p><p>This made Rio cry even more, and Alice had to change tactics.</p><p>‘I’m sorry, babe. You don’t deserve to be treated like this. You’re gonna find someone better.’</p><p>Worse.</p><p>Because Rio knew, she <em>knew </em>that Agatha was the one for her.</p><p>They hadn’t even kissed yet, but Rio could feel it deep in her bones, a kind of mystical psychic knowledge. She, Rio Vidal, was born to be with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Maybe Agatha’s witchiness was rubbing off on her.</p><p>Week two, and Rio was able to get out of bed for a few hours at a time, eat bigger meals, even leave the house.</p><p>In week three, she started studying again, despite the fact it was the final week before the Christmas holidays, and therefore too late to make any real progress with her work before her exams.</p><p>On the Thursday, Alice set her up on a date.</p><p>She went reluctantly, making herself up for the first time in the better part of a month, packing concealer on to cover her deep eyebags. She avoided wearing a skirt, the memory of the hotel with Agatha still painfully fresh.</p><p>Suit it was.</p><p>When she was finished, she didn’t even recognise herself in the mirror. She looked like an actually functioning adult, complete with hair twisted up into a claw clip.</p><p>God, she looked like she worked for the fucking government or something.</p><p>Rio gave herself credit for the fact she stepped into the restaurant, made it to her chair and sat down before balking.</p><p>Her date was fine. Average. Normal. Not Agatha.</p><p>Her hair was blonde.</p><p>Rio reacted to these things with all the sensibility she could muster, which involved getting shitfaced off half a bottle of wine with her dinner. To her date’s credit, she didn’t say anything about how fast Rio was downing each glass, eyes scrunched up against the harsh taste of the red.</p><p>An hour in, Rio was drunk. <em>Definitely</em> drunk. She’d made a pointed effort not to send any signals to her date that this was going to go anyway other than going home separately to pass out in bed, but she didn’t seem to be getting it. She kept extending her leg to caress Rio’s under the table, making her cringe, and think stupidly, nonsensically, of Agatha.</p><p>
<em>Agatha.</em>
</p><p>Agatha, who was walking into the restaurant with Ralph, totally oblivious to Rio’s presence.</p><p>She straightened up immediately in her chair, making her date’s heel drop to the floor with an uncomfortably loud clop.</p><p>‘What?’ she asked, following Rio’s gaze.</p><p>Rio was straining to see Agatha, eyes hazy and unfocused from the wine, hair beginning to fall in strands out of the claw clip and frame her flushed face.</p><p>She looked fucking flawless, of course, wearing that same black dress Ralph had complained about what felt like forever ago. Rio couldn’t help the flash of pride at that. Her hair, mercifully, was tied back in a low bun at the base of her neck.</p><p>Agatha and Ralph sat down, making the barest effort to read the menu before launching into conversation. Ralph’s back was to Rio, meaning she had a full view of Agatha’s stunning face, and approximately ten seconds before she was noticed.</p><p>They were talking lowly, inaudible over the din of clinking cutlery and plates scraping, no matter how hard Rio’s ears strained.</p><p>She felt her heart splitting clean in two, the stitches she’d painstakingly sewn through the crack bursting apart again.</p><p>‘Nothing. Just thought I saw someone I knew.’</p><p>She forced her gaze back to her date, tears threatening her eyes.</p><p>She didn’t know what hurt more, the fact Agatha and Ralph were very clearly still together, or that the absence of Nicky meant they had found a new babysitter.</p><p>She forced herself to lift her fork, push food into her mouth, smile at whatever dumb joke the girl was telling her. She felt like an actor working as an extra in the background of a scene. Playing at reality.</p><hr/><p>Rio <em>felt</em> the very moment Agatha noticed her.</p><p>The mere weight of her gaze made the hair on Rio’s neck stand on end, made her nipples draw tight senselessly, as if they remembered her, and her toes curl hard in her shoes.</p><p>Rio let two beats pass before she lost all self-control, looked up, and allowed her gaze to meet Agatha’s.</p><p>A pulse passed between them as their eyes met, the sheer force of Rio’s desire and love for Agatha making her physically wince.</p><p>Agatha stared, mouth open the tiniest bit, pink of her tongue darting out to wet her lower lip, before she looked away.</p><p>Gaze dropped, just like that, like Rio was nothing to her.</p><p>The worst part was, it was true.</p><hr/><p>By December 23<sup>rd</sup>, Rio had bought Alice exactly four presents, Nicky three, and for Agatha, there was just one. There was no-one else.</p><p>Rio was proud of her self-control, in only getting Agatha one gift. Alice said it didn’t count, considering the fact she’d painstakingly handmade it over the course of at least 11 hours. Rio disagreed.</p><p>‘Rio, I love you, but there’s literally no way you’re gonna get to give it to her. You know that, right?’</p><p>They were sitting in the living room, some shitty Christmas movie on the screen, exchanging gifts before Alice went home that evening.</p><p>‘It’s not about that,’ Rio responded, voice despondent, chin on her knees. She was very interested in one specific section of the carpet.</p><p>‘It’s just the principle.’</p><p>Alice leaned her head on Rio’s shoulder, red hair blending with Rio’s own.</p><p>‘You’re literally crashing out.’ Then softer, ‘I’m sorry I can’t stay for Christmas.’ She sounded genuine in a way that made Rio’s chest clench.</p><p>‘It’s ok, Al. I know you want to spend it with your mom.’</p><p>Rio was going to be alone this year.</p><p>They said goodbye a few hours later, Rio fighting tears the moment Alice looked away, pulling on her hat.</p><p>‘Merry Christmas, Rio.’ Alice said, cupping Rio’s cheek. ‘I hope you get your Christmas wish.’</p><p>The first tear escaped then, slipping down Rio’s face onto Alice’s hand.</p><p>‘Thanks,’ Rio whispered, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>She lay her forehead against the wood, inhaling deeply to calm herself. When she was definitely, completely alone, she sank down onto the doorstep, tears drying in tracks, staining her face.</p><p>‘I won’t.’</p><hr/><p>When Agatha calls on Christmas Eve, Rio has downed an entire bottle of wine on her own.</p><p>She’s lying on the floor of her bedroom in her underwear and an old long-sleeved shirt, smoking a cigarette, a sock tied over the smoke detector.</p><p>She’s playing music so loudly she almost misses the call. Almost.</p><p>When she sees Agatha’s name lighting up her phone in the dark of the room, her heart seizes violently. Rio scrambles up, dropping the lit cigarette onto her bare thigh with a hiss. She answers the call.</p><p>‘Shit,’ she says, as her opener.</p><p>‘Rio?’ Agatha sounds hazy, far-off.</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond for a second, head reeling.</p><p>‘Are you okay?’</p><p>The concern in Agatha’s tone makes her heave into the back of her hand.</p><p>‘What is it?’ Rio says, voice all hard and flinty, as much as she can manage.</p><p>‘Um,’ Agatha whispers, and she’s choked up.</p><p>‘Are <em>you</em> okay?’ Rio asks, feigned toughness gone.</p><p>‘Nicky,’ Agatha manages, and Rio’s heart stops.</p><p>‘What, what, is he alright?’</p><p>Rio can hear Agatha’s smile.</p><p>‘He’s fine, Rio. He was wondering if you’d like to come over.’</p><p>‘He was? Now?’ Rio asked, rubbing at her face with her palm, wincing at the smell of smoke staining her fingers.</p><p>‘I was too. Yes, now. If you would.’ Agatha says, close and guarded.</p><p>‘Okay,’ Rio says instantly, struggling to her feet. The sudden movement made her lurch. She was <em>too fucking drunk</em> for this.</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell Agatha, but the opposite sentiment came out.</p><p>‘Give me an hour.’</p><p>She hung up before Agatha could say anything else, dropping her phone onto her unmade bed and stumbling violently as she made for the bathroom.</p><p>Shower.</p><hr/><p>Rio stared at herself in the circle of mirror she’d cleared from steam.</p><p>She didn’t <em>look</em> drunk.</p><p>The hot water had helped, brought some colour and life to her face again. But that could have just been talking to Agatha.</p><p>She got dressed in a hurry, time running out.</p><p>It was 5pm, and she had no intention of getting dressed up to (probably) get her heart broken again. So she put on sweatpants and called it a day, twisting her wet hair into a knot and securing it with the same claw clip she’d worn the last time she saw Agatha.</p><p>Rio hesitated by the door, keys in her hand. After a moment’s internal deliberation she turned back and crossed into the living room to pick up the bag of gifts she thought she’d never give.</p><p><em>Here goes nothing</em>, she thought as she locked up behind her.</p><hr/><p>Rio stood outside Agatha’s door for the first time in weeks, cheeks flushed from the cold and the brisk walk there. Okay so, maybe it was a light jog. She refused to call it a run.</p><p>The door opened with a bang as Nicky tore it open.</p><p>‘Rio!’</p><p>He jumped into her arms before she could react, and she just barely caught him in time. Rio held him close, spinning him around as he squealed with joy.</p><p>‘Hi buddy!’</p><p>‘Are those presents?’ he asked, honed in on Rio’s bag even from his position on her hip.</p><p>Rio laughed, her first genuine one in what felt like forever.</p><p>‘The blue ones are yours.’</p><p>Nicky pushed off her unceremoniously, reaching for the gifts.</p><p>‘Hi.’ Agatha’s voice was soft, and Rio had to physically prepare her entire body before turning her head to face her.</p><p>‘Hi yourself,’ Rio said gently. Agatha was such a vision, leaning in the doorway in a dressing gown, feet bare on the wooden floor. Her hair was in <em>braids</em>.</p><p>‘Come in,’ Agatha urged, reaching out to clasp her by the elbow. ‘Don’t let my son keep you outside all evening.’</p><p>Nicky was beaming, arms full of Rio’s gifts. Without a word he ran behind Agatha into the house, straight into the living room.</p><p>‘We’d better catch him, or he’s going to open those.’</p><p>‘Yeah,’ Rio replied dumbly, unable to tear her eyes away from the woman in front of her.</p><p>She followed Agatha into the house, vision still all blurred round the edges.</p><p>The living room was much the same, a few new decorations on the tree maybe. Rio tried not to look at the sofa.</p><p>Nicky was settled in front of the TV, sipping on a hot chocolate.</p><p>‘Rio, you want a cocoa?’ Agatha asked, gesturing at his mug.</p><p>‘Yes, please.’</p><p>‘Come into the kitchen, I’ll make you one.’</p><p>Rio set her things down by the sofa, padding after Agatha like a loyal dog, refusing to leave her side. What was she <em>doing</em>?</p><p>The kitchen counter was a mess, dusted with hot chocolate powder.</p><p>Agatha turned to face her properly, her hands wringing in front of her the only visible tell of her anxiety.</p><p>‘Um,’ she said quietly, just like she had on the phone not even an hour earlier.</p><p>When Rio smiled, she continued.</p><p>‘The chocolate doesn’t have milk in it, and I got you oat whipped cream.’</p><p><em>Holy fuck</em>, Rio thought<em>. I’m in love with her.</em></p><p>‘Thank you,’ she said, forcing the reverence out of her voice. She was meant to be annoyed with her.</p><p>There was awkward silence then, too much to say so everything went unspoken. After a minute or two, Agatha was handing her a steaming mug, adorned with a huge pile of whipped cream and a smiley face drawn with chocolate sauce. It made Rio smile too.</p><p>Rio took a sip and bit back a moan. It was heaven in a cup.</p><p>‘Fuck, this is <em>so</em> good Agatha.’</p><p>Rio drank again, meeting Agatha’s eyes over the mug.</p><p>She was flushing, gaze darting to the floor as she tucked her hair behind her ear. Too late, Rio realised what that had sounded like.</p><p>To escape the moment, she forced herself to ask the one thing she had been wondering since she got here. The one thing she did not want to ask.</p><p>‘Where’s Ralph?’</p><p>Agatha looked up then, an unrecognisable emotion on her face.</p><p>‘He’s at his parents’ house.’</p><p>Rio nodded, satisfied with this at least. She didn’t think she ever wanted to see him again.</p><p>They made their way back into the living room, tension coiled between them like a live wire. Rio had a feeling it was going to go unresolved, just fizzle away into nothing.</p><p><em>What am I doing here? </em>she asked herself again, gaze fixed on the back of Agatha’s head where her two braids revealed the line of her scalp.</p><hr/><p>Two hours later, and Rio had finally relaxed.</p><p>She was a long way from sober, her and Agatha were still on the hot chocolate, but about three mugs ago they’d started mixing whiskey in too. It was fun.</p><p>Nicky had adored his presents from Rio, insisting on wearing his new gloves and his hat even indoors where the fire was warming the room. His little cheeks were red from the heat, but he refused to take them off.</p><p>The combination of excitement and warmth had made him tired, his eyes drooping as he struggled to keep them open.</p><p>‘Let me take you up, bud.’ Rio offered him her hand, and he took it eagerly.</p><p>She carried him up the stairs, trying not to remember the last time she’d done this with him, Agatha waiting on the sofa downstairs.</p><p>When she came back down, feeling pretty warm herself, Agatha had cleared away the wrapping paper from Nicky’s gifts.</p><p>Rio stared at her for a second, face hot from the fire and the whiskey.</p><p>Agatha looked nervous.</p><p>She gestured to the place next to her on the sofa, asking Rio with her eyes to take a seat.</p><p>She did, perching gingerly on the edge so as not to get to close to the older woman.</p><p>‘Hey,’ she said, reaching to tangle her fingers in Rio’s.</p><p>Hating herself, Rio pulled her hand back, forcing herself to meet Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>‘You hurt me, Agatha.’</p><p>‘I know, I’m so sorry.’</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, pulse stuttering in her wrists.</p><p>‘I was so confused.’ Agatha explained, worrying at her bottom lip with her tooth.</p><p>‘You think I wasn’t?’ Rio replied, voice rising a little against her will.</p><p>‘Ralph-’ Agatha began.</p><p>‘Holy fuck,’ Rio growled. ‘What I wouldn’t do to never hear you say that man’s name again.’</p><p>Despite herself, Agatha smirked at that.</p><p>‘What I was saying, is that Ralph-’</p><p>An exasperated sigh from Rio, before she crowded in close to Agatha, a breath away. Her right hand came up to grip Agatha’s neck from the side, cutting her off with a whimper. Agatha’s eyes dropped to Rio’s mouth, pupils darkening visibly.</p><p>‘Don’t say it again.’ Rio implored, voice rough as she stared wantonly at Agatha’s mouth. There was a tiny chocolate mark on her upper lip.</p><p>‘We broke up.’ Agatha eked out, scarcely a whisper.</p><p>‘What?’ Rio sat back, dropping Agatha’s face and mouth falling open in shock.</p><p>‘I came home from the hotel and broke up with him.’</p><p>Rio was just staring, stunned.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ she said slowly, tasting the word. ‘I’ve literally been going insane for three weeks.’</p><p>Agatha smirked. ‘You said that before.’</p><p>‘No,’ Rio admonished. ‘It’s not funny.’</p><p>Agatha’s face dropped, her expression twisting into one of sadness.</p><p>She grasped Rio’s hands. Rio let her this time.</p><p>‘I’m truly sorry. I needed to give Nicky time to adjust to being here without his dad.’</p><p>Then, quieter. ‘I needed time to understand my feelings for you.’</p><p>Rio whimpered, the pain threatening to spill out in the form of tears.</p><p>‘I saw you, at the restaurant. You were on a date with him.’ She spat the word ‘date’.</p><p>Agatha’s hands slipped further up Rio’s arms until she was gripping her elbows, forcibly turning Rio to face her.</p><p>She reached up to brush the tears from Rio’s eyelashes with the pads of her fingers.</p><p>‘Rio. <em>Sweetheart</em>.’</p><p>Rio let out an embarrassing noise somewhere between a whine and a sob.</p><p>‘We were discussing custody of Nicky.’</p><p>‘Really?’ Rio asked, voice wobbly.</p><p>‘Really. Come here.’</p><p>Agatha tugged her forwards until she was half-leaning, half lying on top of her.</p><p>Rio moaned happily, instantly burrowing her face into Agatha’s shoulder, nosing at the skin of her neck.</p><p>Agatha drew her close, hands running up and down her back to soothe her.</p><p>When she had calmed, Rio pushed herself up on her elbows to look into Agatha’s face. Without a word, she reached forward, brushing a finger down Agatha’s warm cheek.</p><p>As if on instinct, Agatha’s mouth parted, like she wanted Rio to put her finger inside. Rio filed that information away for later.</p><p>Instead, she thumbed at the tie holding Agatha’s right braid together, sliding it off completely. With agonising slowness, she pulled gently at each section of hair to loose it from the plait.</p><p>By the time the entire braid was unravelled, Rio was breathing heavily, breath coming out in little puffs that hit the side of Agatha’s face. Agatha was in much the same state, shifting beneath her as she worked, pupils dark and hungry.</p><p>Rio slid her entire hand through Agatha’s free hair, clasping it lightly. Agatha let out a low whine as her grip tightened, using her leverage to tip Agatha’s head back against the arm of the sofa.</p><p>Just when Agatha thought she couldn’t wait another second, Rio began to undo her other braid, unravelling it with the same excruciating care.</p><p>When Agatha’s hair was completely loose, splayed over Rio’s hands like a prize she’d won, she pressed her lips to Agatha’s forehead, nose to her hairline and inhaled.</p><p>God, Agatha was <em>shaking</em>.</p><p>Rio placed the tiniest kiss there, before turning Agatha’s head this way and that, kissing at her face wherever her mouth could reach, dragging her nose against Agatha’s cheekbones.</p><p>‘Jesus, Rio,’ Agatha heaved out, and her voice sent something hot and electric straight into Rio’s gut.</p><p>‘Just fucking <em>kiss me</em> already.’</p><p>Rio drew back, smirk playing on her lips.</p><p>‘Bossy,’ she said, then dipped her head down and kissed Agatha hard on the mouth, moaning instantly at finally, <em>finally, </em>tasting her.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open, gasping into Rio’s like she was her only source of oxygen.</p><p>Rio sucked hard on her bottom lip, like she’d been dreaming about for months, eyes drawn to it every time Agatha worried at the skin there.</p><p>Agatha’s hands were scrabbling for purchase on Rio’s back, gripping at her shoulders as she tried to bring their bodies ever closer. As she shifted beneath her, she accidentally brought her thigh up between Rio’s, making her groan and pull away for a second, breathing heavily.</p><p>There was a strand of saliva connecting their mouths, and Rio couldn’t stop staring.</p><p>‘Fuck,’ someone said, and Rio was only distantly aware it was her.</p><p>Agatha leaned up, grasping at Rio’s jaw and tugging her back down, not to kiss her, but to whisper in her ear as she pressed her thigh upwards again.</p><p>Rio made a strangled sound into her shoulder, and Agatha slipped her hand into the pocket of Rio’s sweatpants to palm at her ass and control her movements.</p><p>‘Sweetheart…’ Agatha said lowly, directly into Rio’s ear, just to make her moan.</p><p>‘You really want me this much?’ she asked, tone just on the right side of the line between teasing and degrading.</p><p>Rio was helpless to do anything but whimper, silently begging as she ground her hips down onto Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>‘You want me so badly, you’d let me get you off on my leg, without even taking these off,’ Agatha whispered, tugging at the fabric on Rio’s waist to make her point.</p><p>Rio nodded, dragging herself back and forth over Agatha’s leg, the friction of the fabric making her clit burn deliciously. From above, it probably looked like she was inside Agatha, and that thought had her teetering on the edge in an embarrassingly short amount of time.</p><p>‘God,’ she huffed out against Agatha’s neck, slurring with desire. ‘You’re so fucking hot. Wanna fuck you so bad.’</p><p>Agatha made her own noise at this, strangled and incredulous.</p><p>‘You can,’ she promised, angling Rio until she was pressing even harder against her. Rio was thrusting against her in earnest, the fantasy fueling her as she rubbed off on Agatha’s leg.</p><p>‘Feel what you’re doing to me,’ Agatha panted, grasping Rio’s hand in hers and drawing it inside her robe and down under the waistband of her pyjama pants.</p><p>Rio could <em>fucking feel</em> the heat emanating from Agatha.</p><p>At the first touch of Agatha’s overheated, wet skin, Rio came hard against her leg, biting into the older woman’s shoulder to muffle her scream of pleasure.</p><p>Rio was shaking against her, breath coming out in harsh pants. Agatha was in the same state.</p><p>‘Okay?’ Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio shook her head against Agatha’s shoulder, her emotions brimming at the surface the way they always did right after coming.</p><p>Agatha repeated herself, rubbing Rio’s back soothingly.</p><p>‘Baby? You okay?’</p><p>Rio’s heart cracked again, and she was suddenly terrified to meet Agatha’s eyes, convinced her emotions would be written all over her face.</p><p>‘Wait,’ Agatha whispered, before reaching for Rio’s hand, the one inside Agatha’s robe, and drawing it up and out. She squeezed it firmly, as was their way, before gripping it at the wrist and sliding Rio’s fingers home into her hair.</p><p>Rio let out a happy moan, smiling against her neck.</p><p>‘Better?’ Agatha asked, her own smile audible in her tone.</p><p>‘Yes.’ Rio said immediately, shifting to lay her head on the armrest, before using her hold on Agatha’s hair to bring their faces together in a soft kiss, nothing like their first.</p><p>They lay that way for a while, just kissing and getting used to the feel of each other’s mouths. Eventually, Rio’s hand started to wander, drifting from Agatha’s hair to cover her breast, squeezing gently, making Agatha’s mouth fall open in a groan.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio whispered, shifting ever closer.</p><p>‘Hmm?’ Agatha responded, pressing herself into Rio’s hand, her nipple hard through her robe, rough against her palm.</p><p>‘When was the last time you had an orgasm?’ Rio asked, rolling at her nipple as she did.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open, bright and wide with lust.</p><p>‘Oh god, Rio, it’s been so long, Ralph-’</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed with annoyance, dropping Agatha’s breast and coming up to clasp her chin.</p><p>‘Agatha. <em>Please</em> never say his name again.’</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh into Rio’s palm, grinning up at her. She opened her mouth again, and the bell rang, loud.</p><p>The noise was jarring and random, seemingly out of context in the bubble of lust that surrounded Agatha and Rio.</p><p>It took a second ring to make them sit up, breathing hard, faces flushed.</p><p>A pounding on the door.</p><p>‘Agatha?’</p><p>‘Shit.’ Agatha said.</p><p>Then she looked at Rio, scared and insistent, fear eating the desire out of her eyes.</p><p>‘Ralph,’ she whispered.</p><p> </p>

<p>Ralph was standing outside the front door with his arms crossed in front of him, bundled up in a too-big jacket, nose red from the cold.</p><p>Agatha opened it to him, robe pulled tight around her waist.</p><p>‘What is it?’ she asked, calm, but Rio could hear the tiniest tremor in her voice from her position behind the living room door.</p><p>‘What?’ Ralph huffed, lurching forward into the house. ‘I can’t see my own wife on Christmas Eve?’</p><p>‘I’m not your wife, Ralph.’ Agatha sounded small, tired. ‘I never have been.’</p><p>Rio could hear the distinctly male sound Ralph made as he kicked off his snow boots. A sort of heaving grunt, like an angry horse. God, she hated his guts.</p><p>‘I want Nicky.’ Ralph said then, voice rough and demanding.</p><p>‘I want to spend Christmas Day with my son, Ralph, come on.’</p><p>‘You had him today.’</p><p>‘I bought all his presents. Do you even know what we got him this year?’</p><p>A scoff, then the sound of Ralph’s palm hitting the wall.</p><p>Rio’s hands were clenched into fists.</p><p>‘I’m going to go upstairs and wake my son, and he’s coming with me.’</p><p>Another noise, like a slap, then a hurt sound torn from Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Rio was bursting out before she could think about it.</p><p>Ralph’s hand was encircling Agatha’s upper arm, gripping it so hard his knuckles were white. When he saw Rio, he let go.</p><p>‘Rio?’ he said, confused.</p><p>Then his eyes dropped to her red chest, took in her sweatpants and make-up free face. He turned to stare at Agatha, in her robe with her hair messy.</p><p>‘What the fuck,’ he whispered.</p><p>Then loud, voice rising into a shout. ‘You’re fucking the <em>nanny</em>?’</p><p>‘Keep it down.’ Agatha hissed, gesturing at the stairs. ‘Nicky’s asleep.’</p><p>‘Well?’ Ralph sneered, pointing a single accusing finger at Rio.</p><p>‘It’s not just sex.’ Agatha said quietly, surprising Rio, and shocking Ralph further into hysteria.</p><p>‘Jesus Christ. I knew about Wanda, but what the <em>fuck</em>. I thought it was just a porn thing.’</p><p>Rio bristled at that, summoning all the power of the universe to force her mouth shut and keep her hands by her side.</p><p>Agatha reached for her, clawing blindly behind her through the air, never taking her eyes off Ralph. Rio clasped their palms together, soothing her with a thumb brushing over her knuckles.</p><p>He looked down between them, where they were joined, and his face twisted into a scowl.</p><p>‘Nicky!’ he yelled, in the direction of the stairs.</p><p>‘Shut up,’ Agatha said angrily. ‘You’ll wake him.’</p><p>‘Good. He deserves to know that his mom’s a-’</p><p>A pause, another hateful look at their joined hands. ‘A dyke.’</p><p>Rio dropped Agatha’s hand and reeled forward, slamming an elbow into Ralph’s chest, pushing him against the wall. His head made a loud crack as it snapped back. She had at least two inches on him.</p><p>When she spoke, her voice was low and steely.</p><p>‘Don’t you ever – <em>ever</em> – talk to Agatha like that.’</p><p>When Ralph just stared, stunned, Rio continued.</p><p>‘You piece of <em>fucking shit</em>. Nicky doesn’t deserve to be stuck with you as a father.’</p><p>Ralph grasped Rio’s wrist, bending it back harshly until she winced hard.</p><p>‘Fuck,’ she spat, and Agatha slipped an arm around her waist from behind.</p><p>‘Rio,’ she said, and Rio stepped back into her embrace, fighting tears, suddenly wanting to be nowhere near Ralph.</p><p>‘Mama?’ came a little voice from the top of the stairs.</p><p>Ralph dropped his nasty demeanour immediately, beaming up at Nicky.</p><p>‘Hey kid, I’ve come to take you somewhere really fun for Christmas.’</p><p>Nicky pouted, clinging to the banister, his favourite toy clenched in his arms.</p><p>‘I want to stay with Mama and Rio.’</p><p>‘Well, you’re coming with me. To stay with Grandma and Grandpa.’</p><p>Nicky perked up at that, rushing down to where they were standing at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>‘Really? Mama, can I go?’</p><p>Agatha sighed, bending to pick him up.</p><p>‘Only if you want to.’</p><p>‘I do,’ Nicky said solemnly, reaching for his father’s hand.</p><p>Ralph clutched it like he’d won a prize in the claw machine at a fair.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio whispered. ‘You don’t have to do this.’</p><p>‘Can you bring him back after lunch?’ Agatha said, ignoring Rio and addressing Ralph with a firm tone.</p><p>Ralph looked stunned that Agatha was letting him take Nicky without a fight, so much so that he softened.</p><p>‘Okay. I’ll bring him after lunch. Say goodbye to your mother.’</p><p>Nicky looped his arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>‘Bye Mama.’ He leaned back and grinned at Rio.</p><p>‘Bye Rio.’</p><p>Rio ruffled his hair, gesturing to Agatha with a pointed look.</p><p>Nicky got the message, smiling and pressing a kiss to his mother’s cheek, making her smile in turn.</p><p>Agatha busied herself with putting together a bag for him, while Rio pulled on his socks and shoes and found his coat. Ralph was just standing there, scrolling on his phone as if nothing had happened.</p><p>That fuckhead didn’t even love Agatha enough to fight for her. Rio was livid.</p><hr/><p>As soon as the door was shut behind them, Agatha was on her.</p><p>‘Are you okay? Did he hurt you?’</p><p>She cradled Rio’s wrist in her hands, smoothing her thumbs over the faint red mark next to her tattoo.</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her brow, where it was creased with worry.</p><p>‘I’m okay. Has he done that to you before?’</p><p>Agatha made no reply, eyes shiny with unspent emotion, pupils round and dark in the dim hallway.</p><p>‘Agatha? Are you okay? I’m so, so sorry about Nicky and I shouldn’t have-’</p><p>She was mid-sentence when Agatha spun her round and pushed her up against the wall, right where she’d had Ralph pressed just minutes ago.</p><p>‘God, that was hot,’ Agatha husked, and suddenly, Rio remembered what they’d been doing before Ralph had arrived, remembered how wet Agatha was under that robe.</p><p>‘I wanna fucking kill him,’ Rio said back, wrapping both arms possessively around Agatha’s waist and tugging her in close, breath hot against her cheek.</p><p>‘Rio,’ Agatha snorted, a smile playing at her lips. ‘Don’t be silly.’</p><p>‘No. I’m not.’</p><p>Rio schooled her features into her most serious expression.</p><p>‘I,’ she said, dragging the word out. ‘Want… To… <em>Kill..</em>. Him.’</p><p>Agatha, <em>the freak</em>, actually moaned at this, pressing even further into Rio.</p><p>‘Take me to bed,’ she whispered, brushing Rio’s hair behind her ear where it had fallen loose.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to be told twice, lifting Agatha up into the air where she had her tight at the waist, setting her on the third step, turning her round and holding her from behind.</p><p>‘Lead the way,’ she rasped into Agatha’s ear, mouth wet against her shoulder, Agatha shuddering against her.</p><p>Agatha stumbled on step five, making Rio giggle, and earning her a harsh look. They made it to the top of the stairs before Agatha had Rio up against the wall again, kissing her like she was starving for it.</p><p>Rio gripped her wrists hard, pulling her impossibly closer, guiding her gently down the hall without disconnecting their mouths. When they reached Agatha’s bedroom door, Rio hesitated, unsure. This was the room she had shared with Ralph.</p><p>Agatha kicked the door open, not bothering with the handle, and pulled Rio inside.</p><p>The room was totally unrecognisable as the one that Rio had snuck a look at weeks before. It was incredibly neat for one, but instead of the plain utilitarian bedsheets, Agatha had dark green ones with embroidered flowers on. Ralph’s side was completely gutted, no trace of the man who had lived and slept there.</p><p>Agatha misinterpreted Rio’s surprise as interest.</p><p>‘You can look around all you want, after,’ she murmured, breathing ragged from kissing on the stairs.</p><p>Rio grinned, steering her back enough to lock eyes as she lowered Agatha onto the bed and sat astride her lap.</p><p>‘Made it all neat for me?’</p><p>Agatha nodded, gaze trained on Rio’s swollen mouth.</p><p>‘Presumptuous,’ Rio teased, reaching up to pull her own shirt off.</p><p>‘I had a feeling it wouldn’t be too hard to get you in here.’</p><p>Rio mock-gasped, placing her hand on her bare chest in fake affront. It drew Agatha’s eyes straight to her bra, dark-green lace making her skin seem pale in the dim room.</p><p>‘You think I’m that eas-,’</p><p>‘Rio, darling, shut up and get your mouth on me.’</p><p>‘Yep.’</p><p>A squeak as Agatha tugged her down hard until her tattooed arms were bracketing her head on the bed. Agatha’s hair was a total <em>mess</em>, and Rio had never loved it more.</p><p>Rio dropped down the couple of centimetres it took to kiss her, slotting their mouths together with a growing ease, gentle at first, then opening her mouth to dip her tongue into Agatha’s, earning her a rich moan.</p><p>Agatha reached up to smooth her palms down Rio’s overheated back, snapping her bra clasp open with her left hand, squeezing Rio’s rib over her rose tattoo with her right. Rio gasped into her mouth at the combination, bra falling down her arms to hang uselessly over her belly.</p><p>Agatha tore at it impatiently, flinging it across the room. It landed on a lamp.</p><p>Rio sucked gently on Agatha’s tongue, a promise of more, as Agatha palmed her chest greedily, using her hold on Rio’s breasts to draw her down even closer. She was panting, red at the neck from arousal.</p><p>Rio couldn’t resist pulling away to loosen her robe, hand sneaking down between them to tug on the end of the tie, making Agatha gasp.</p><p>‘God, I thought you were about to actually touch me.’</p><p>Rio blew out a laugh against her cheek, stupid and delirious.</p><p>‘Give me a second, need to look at you.’</p><p>As suspected, Agatha’s flush went down further than the robe had been showing, deep into the valley between her breasts.</p><p>Her breasts, which were fully out in the open for Rio to see and touch. Pink and lovely, her nipples were hard, goosebumps standing up all across her middle.</p><p>‘Uh,’ Rio said dumbly, hardly able to think. ‘Have you been naked under this all evening?’</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and puffed out her cheeks in annoyance.</p><p>‘Hurry up,’ she said, ignoring Rio’s question.</p><p>‘Are you cold?’ Rio asked, teasing now, drawing her fingernails lightly over Agatha’s stomach where the goosebumps were most obvious.</p><p>‘God, Rio, shut up, are you waiting for me to fucking <em>beg</em>?’</p><p>‘No,’ Rio said seriously, dropping her smile, turning it into a smirk. ‘But that’s not a bad idea.’</p><p>Agatha widened her eyes in protest, silently warning Rio not to push it.</p><p>‘Okay, another time,’ Rio promised, finally sinking to her knees in front of Agatha, who was staring at her like she was a divine entity.</p><p>‘Open up, my love,’ she said lowly, tapping at Agatha’s thighs, bunching the fabric of the robe up until it revealed plain purple underwear.</p><p>Agatha’s legs sprang open at Rio’s request, spreading them shamelessly.</p><p>She was visibly wet through the material and the sight of it made Rio groan, knocking her forehead against Agatha’s tense thigh.</p><p>‘Fuck, fuck, fuck,’ she chanted, digging her nails into her palms to stay present. She was in fucking <em>heaven</em>.</p><p>‘What is it?’ Agatha asked, a bit of insecurity in her tone, leaning up on her elbows to meet Rio’s eyes. Her loose hair fell over her breasts, obscuring them from Rio’s view a little, her nipples only just visible. Somehow it made her look even sexier.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio said, very seriously. ‘You are perfect.’</p><p>A pause.</p><p>‘And I’m going to make you come as many times as you can take.’</p><p>Agatha’s breath left her in a loud exhale as she flopped back down on to the bed.</p><p>‘Please,’ she said dryly, and Rio would believe her unaffected tone if the evidence of Agatha’s want wasn’t right in front of her face, staining her underwear. She would believe it if she couldn’t actually smell it, ripe and heady like baked apples.</p><p>Not wasting another second, Rio slipped two fingers under the fabric, right where the wet spot was biggest. She pulled it to the side, dipped her head forward, and drew her tongue through Agatha’s slick in one long, unbroken line until she reached her clit at the top. Rio couldn’t resist giving it a quick, dirty suck.</p><p>Agatha practically screamed, clamping her thighs down hard around Rio’s ears, digging her hands into her hair.</p><p>‘<em>Fuck</em>,’ she moaned, and Rio pulled back a little to try and see her face.</p><p>She slipped her fingers through the wet heat where Agatha was swollen, rocking back on her ankles to make eye contact with her.</p><p>‘Jesus, did that <em>moron</em> never touch you?’ Rio hissed.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to answer but Rio chose that moment to slide a single finger inside her, making whatever she was about to say come out as a choked off moan.</p><p>‘Don’t answer that,’ Rio growled.</p><p> She dove back in to mouth at Agatha’s clit, crooking her middle finger gently inside her to make sure it didn’t hurt.</p><p>‘More,’ Agatha managed, hands no longer in Rio’s hair but pressed to her own face as she shuddered against the bed.</p><p>Rio smirked against her, and Agatha felt it as she lifted her legs up onto her shoulders, tugging her unceremoniously closer to the edge of the bed. Agatha’s ankles hooked around Rio’s back immediately, forcing her in deeper with her hand and mouth.</p><p>Rio slid her index finger inside her, relishing her answering groan of pleasure.</p><p>She wasn’t really fucking in and out, just sort of holding them inside her as she laved at Agatha’s clit, using her tongue to draw back the hood and get at her most sensitive part.</p><p>Agatha’s legs were shaking.</p><p>‘So pretty,’ Rio whined, drunk on the taste and feel of her. ‘Taste so good.’</p><p>Agatha moaned in response, driving her heels into Rio’s back with a force that would be painful if Rio wasn’t on her knees, doing exactly what she’d been dreaming of for <em>months</em>.</p><p>She withdrew her fingers suddenly, wet to the knuckle. Agatha made a noise of protest, before Rio switched to her middle and fourth finger, driving them back into her both at once, getting at her deeper this way. Agatha’s complaining whine morphed into a moan, stupid loud.</p><p>‘Oh god,’ she whined, twisting the sheets up on the bed.</p><p>If Rio hadn’t come less than half an hour ago, she thought she might just from witnessing Agatha like this.</p><p>She was actually kind of surprised how long Agatha was able to last, if it really had been as much time as she said. As if on cue, Agatha’s thighs tightened around her ears, the room growing muffled.</p><p>‘Rio,’ she gasped, grinding her hips up onto Rio’s tongue and fingers in an impressive show of core strength.</p><p>‘Baby, I -’</p><p>That was all she managed before she seized up further, contracting hard around Rio’s fingers, pulsing onto her tongue as her orgasm took over. Rio actually <em>heard </em>her come, a little spray of liquid hitting her chin as she worked Agatha through it.</p><p>
<em>Holy shit.</em>
<em> </em>
</p><p>When Agatha’s legs fell away from their vice grip around Rio, she was up and on her like a shot.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ Rio whispered reverently, drawing her hands away from where they covered her blushing face. ‘Did you just-’</p><p>‘Shut up. Shut up.’ Agatha protested, eyes wide with it.</p><p>‘No, <em>fuck</em>, it was perfect.’ Rio reassured her instantly, covering her cheeks with kisses, mouth unwiped.</p><p>‘You’re perfect,’ she continued, ‘-and that was only one. I promised many.’</p><p>Agatha groaned, rolling onto her side and burying her sweaty face in Rio’s neck, right where her pulse was thrumming under her skin. Rio’s hands came up to hold her, threading her fingers into her hair and pressing a kiss to her crown. Heaven.</p><p>‘Give me ten minutes. I’m not twenty anymore.’ Agatha said.</p><p>‘Thank god for that.’ Rio replied, laying kisses into her hair.</p><hr/><p>Rio woke on Christmas morning to Agatha’s head between her legs, dipping down to nip at her lower belly, pressing her cheek into the curls between Rio’s thighs. She was wet at their junction, sore from the night before, still swollen open.</p><p>‘Mmm,’ she managed, body waking up before her mind did.</p><p>Agatha planted gentle kisses on her thighs, shimmying up the bed to lie on top of her when she realised Rio was awake.</p><p>‘Merry Christmas,’ she whispered, kissing Rio softly on the mouth.</p><p>‘Merry Christmas,’ Rio replied. Then a smirk, a quirk on the right side of her face. ‘Are you my gift? Because if so, I think I already unwrapped it last night.’</p><p>Agatha swatted at her, false annoyance painted on.</p><p>‘You’re such an idiot.’</p><p>Rio smiled fully then, so hard her cheeks hurt. She drew her arms tight around Agatha, drawing her down to press against her still-naked body, littering her face with kisses.</p><p>In a moment, she had them flipped, fully awake now.</p><p>Agatha let out a grunt as Rio pressed her into the mattress, covering her body. Nudging her legs open with one of her own revealed what Rio had suspected. Agatha was wet already, or still wet from last night, impossible to tell.</p><p>Rio pressed down with the soft curve of her hip, angling her thigh into Agatha like they’d done in reverse on the sofa.</p><p><em>‘Rio,’ </em>Agatha moaned.</p><p>Rio was struck by a terrible fear that she would never get enough of this, never tire of hearing Agatha say her name like that.</p><p>She realised, some minutes into rocking gently against Agatha, drawing out her whines and moans, that they were no longer fucking. They were making love.</p><p>Agatha came with a soft cry, muffling it into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to collapse into her, muscles burning with the effort of holding herself up on her elbows.</p><p>She let out a grunt as she took Rio’s weight, encircling her in her arms.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. ‘Who knew I could do that so many times in the space of 12 hours?’</p><p>Rio pressed kiss after kiss to her mouth, making her smile.</p><p>‘What is it,’ Agatha asked, but it didn’t sound like a question.</p><p>‘Nothing.’ Rio murmured, touching Agatha’s face obsessively, smoothing her thumbs along her eyebrows, bending down to mouth at her nose.</p><p>‘Something. You’re beautiful,’ Rio whispered. ‘God, I love your nose.’</p><p>‘Really?’ Agatha said, speaking in a hushed tone despite the fact they were alone in the house.</p><p>‘I thought for a very long time about having – don’t laugh – a nose job.’</p><p>‘What?’ Rio reared up, staring down at Agatha in shock. ‘You’re joking.’</p><p>‘No. I hated it when I was your age.’</p><p>‘And now?’ Rio asked, incredulous.</p><p>‘It’s okay. I’ve accepted it.’</p><p>‘Accepted it? Agatha it’s-’ she lowered her face again, kissed at it some more. ‘My favourite part of your face.’</p><p>Agatha smirked, something wicked dawning in her eyes. She reached down Rio’s bare back to her legs, tapping her thigh with her left hand.</p><p>‘Get up here then.’</p><p>‘Uh-’ Rio stuttered out, brain blinking off for a moment. ‘What?’</p><p>‘I just figure…,’ Agatha began, encouraging Rio to move up with her hands. ‘If you like my nose so much… you should probably come sit on it.’</p><p>Rio definitely blacked out a little then, barely managing to respond.</p><p>‘Fuck. Okay. Hang on.’</p><p>She shuffled up the bed on her knees, straddling Agatha, moaning at the slide of her slick against Agatha’s bare stomach.</p><p>‘Are you sure?’ she asked, reaching down to kiss her one more time.</p><p>‘Rio, please stop talking.’</p><p>‘Yep, okay-,’ Rio huffed out a breath as her thighs came up to bracket Agatha’s head. She could feel Agatha’s hair under her knees where they were resting either side of her ears, and that simple touch made her shaky with want.</p><p>‘Hold onto the headboard,’ Agatha ordered in a scratchy voice, before guiding Rio down onto her waiting mouth with a gentle hand on her lower back.</p><p>Rio did as she was told, hands flying out to grip onto the wooden frame. The first touch of Agatha’s tongue to her wet skin made her shudder, inadvertently grinding down onto her face.</p><p>Agatha moaned against her, the sound vibrating through Rio like sitting on a speaker. She sucked Rio’s clit into her mouth, tonguing at it with little kitten licks. <em>Fuck.</em> Rio’s knees were already shaking.</p><p>Agatha’s tongue slipped down further, curling through the slick where Rio was burning hottest, and tasted strongest. Rio whined in protest at the loss of contact to her clit, and Agatha moved her face very slightly.</p><p>Now Agatha’s tongue was probing into Rio, and she was free to grind herself down hard onto Agatha’s nose, the pressure and friction instantly perfect against the bundle of nerves.</p><p>‘Oh holy fucking <em>shit</em>,’ Rio gasped, dragging herself up and down the ridge of Agatha’s nose. Every time she neared the top of it, the bump where the bone was slightly raised pressed against her clit in the most delicious way.</p><p>Rio let go of the headboard, unable to grip it at all, melting into a puddle against Agatha’s face.</p><p>‘I’m sorry,’ she panted, weight fully bearing down on Agatha now.</p><p>Agatha reached up and hooked her thumbs into the notch of Rio’s hips in wordless response, pulling her down harder and holding her tight against her mouth.</p><p>Rio had the distinct thought that it was probably a struggle for Agatha to breathe, then promptly lost the ability to think at all when Agatha started nodding against her, drawing her head up then down in quick succession, then shaking it side to side, using her entire face to get Rio off.</p><p>Rio lasted about three seconds of this before she started to come into Agatha’s mouth, on a downward drag where Agatha’s lip caught her most sensitive spot. Agatha sensed her orgasm instantly, lifting her nose up to grind hard against Rio, drawing out her pleasure.</p><p>‘Jesus <em>fucking</em> Christ- fuck,’ Rio swore as she fell on her side next to Agatha, thighs burning.</p><p>Agatha beamed up at her, face smeared with come from the spot between her eyebrows to just under the curve of her chin. It was in her eyelashes.</p><p>‘Hey now, that’s not very nice,’ Her voice was croaky from the exertion. ‘It is his birthday you know.’</p><p>Rio fell upon her with well-earned reverence, licking at her like a cat, cleaning up her cheeks, her nose, her lips.</p><p>Agatha laughed, pushing her away onto her back.</p><p>‘My tongue is sore,’ she announced into the air between them. Then quieter, ‘I’ve never been happier.’</p><p>Rio’s heart twinged at that, at the genuine emotion beneath the teasing tone.</p><p>‘Not just sex?’ she asked, unable to meet Agatha’s eyes, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>‘Ah. I was wondering when you’d bring that up.’</p><p>Rio smiled a watery smile, uncertainty creeping into her chest, winding round her heart.</p><p>‘Unfortunately for me,’ Agatha continued, ‘I seem to have grown rather fond of you.’</p><p>‘And I, you,’ Rio returned, on her side now to gaze into Agatha’s face, dark almond eyes meeting blue.</p><p>‘Well, <em>yes</em>.’ Agatha said, like Rio was being dumb.</p><p>Rio’s phone started to buzz on the bedside table where it was plugged in, face-down.</p><p>She leaned over to check it, knowing who it was even before she did. Only one person would FaceTime her on Christmas morning.</p><p>‘Quick,’ she said to Agatha. ‘Pull the sheets up around yourself. And for god’s sake, wipe your face.’</p><p>Agatha smirked at this, unmoving, forcing Rio to dart forward and dab at her face with the edge of the duvet.</p><p>Rio answered the call, sliding the button across the screen with her thumb.</p><p>‘Alice,’ she said, by way of greeting, at the very moment Alice began to sing a strange rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ where she replaced the words with ‘Merry Christmas’.</p><p>She got to ‘Merry Christmas, dear Rio’ before she noticed the state Rio was in.</p><p>Flushed face and bare from the shoulders down. Her jaw dropped, clicking audibly through the phone.</p><p>
<em>‘No.’</em>
</p><p>Rio beamed. She turned the phone, angling it until Agatha was in view, hair a wild mane around her pink face.</p><p>‘Holy <em>shit</em>.’ Alice squealed, jumping up and down on the spot. It made Agatha laugh. ‘No fucking <em>way</em>!’</p><p>‘You must be Alice,’ Agatha said, calm as if she wasn’t naked on FaceTime with a stranger, fucked out and obvious about it.</p><p>‘I’ve heard a lot about you.’</p><p>‘God, you too,’ Alice replied. ‘Obviously. Wow, Rio was right about your hair.’</p><p>‘<em>Aliceeee</em>,’ Rio whined.</p><p>‘Ah yes,’ Agatha, smirking now. ‘I hear it’s been quite the topic in your house.’</p><p>‘Like you would not believe. The other day she-’</p><p>Rio muted her, flushing with embarrassment as if she hadn’t just been riding Agatha’s face.</p><p>‘Hey!’ Agatha protested. ‘I was enjoying that.’</p><p>‘Bye Alice,’ Rio said pointedly. ‘Merry Christmas.’</p><p>Alice continued talking, unaware she was inaudible.</p><p>Rio raised the volume, in time to catch Alice saying something about a shrine to Agatha’s hair.</p><p>‘That’s enough, Al, thank you,’ Rio said, cringing.</p><p>Alice giggled, before schooling her features into a more serious expression.</p><p>‘Agatha?’</p><p>Rio tilted the phone towards her.</p><p>‘Yes?’ Agatha replied.</p><p>Rio held her breath for whatever her best friend was going to say.</p><p>‘Please don’t hurt her again.’ Alice said. Then right after, to soften the moment, ‘it's only that I can’t take another month of hysterics.’</p><p>‘I shall do my best, dear Alice.’ Agatha promised, entwining her fingers with Rio’s off camera.</p><p>Rio ended the call, and no sooner had she done so than Agatha was hugging her tight.</p><p>‘You really cried that much for me?’</p><p>Rio exhaled, considered lying.</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>‘I’m sorry,’ Agatha whispered, cradling her close. ‘I’m sorry, little love.’</p><p>Rio swallowed hard around rising tears, opening her mouth to reply.</p><p>Her stomach growled loudly.</p><p>‘Breakfast?’ she asked.</p><p>‘I’ve already had mine,’ Agatha teased, ‘but I’m sure we can find you something. Then I want to give you your gift.’</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha’s first gift to Rio was a pair of hand-knit gloves with tiny hearts dotted all over them. She loved it. The second gift was another round of head, and Rio loved <em>that</em> even more.</p><p>The fact Agatha had made her the gloves made Rio less self-conscious about the hand-drawn, painted and glossed tarot deck she’d made, specifically designed for Agatha.</p><p>They were in the living room, Agatha on the floor as she tore the paper off like a child. She was wearing a Christmas jumper and fluffy socks, hair in a ponytail, and Rio’s poor heart kept stuttering every time they made eye contact, as if Agatha hadn’t had her head between her legs not even an hour ago.</p><p>Agatha asked her if she’d bought herself a gift, and the question made her oddly emotional.</p><p>‘I didn’t know that was a thing people did.’</p><p>Agatha smiled. ‘Maybe not, but I do it every year. Just once, I buy myself something I’ve wanted all year, no guilt, just for me.’</p><p>‘What did you get yourself this year?’ Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha’s face changed, cheeks darkening as she looked away.</p><p>
<em>Oh. </em>
</p><p>‘Wanna open your gift from me?’ Rio said, changing the subject, alleviating Agatha’s sudden discomfort.</p><p>Her eyes lit up again as she dived across the room for the gift wrapped in purple paper, tied up with a green bow.</p><p>Rio waited with bated breath as Agatha unwrapped the deck, hiding the tremor of her hands by sitting on them.</p><p>Agatha held the deck in her hands, the first card facing up. Rio had painted <em>‘Agatha’s Tarot’</em> in sloping red cursive, and Agatha seemed close to tears already.</p><p>‘Oh my god,’ she whispered, thumbing through the first few. ‘Where did you get these?’ she asked, staring up at Rio in awe.</p><p>Rio blushed immediately, tucking her hair behind her ear.</p><p>‘I uh, may have made them for you.’</p><p>Agatha looked closer, holding a card up to her nose for inspection.</p><p>‘I had no idea you were an artist,’ she murmured, flicking through the cards faster now.</p><p>‘Holy shit,’ she breathed. ‘This must have taken forever.’</p><p>‘They’re not perfect, I know, but I wanted you to have them on time for Christmas-’</p><p>Agatha dropped the cards to the floor and flung herself upwards into Rio’s lap in one swift movement.</p><p>‘<em>Rio</em>,’ she husked, and her voice had dropped an octave. ‘What’s <em>this</em> one?’</p><p>Rio shifted back on the sofa to accommodate her sudden lapful of Agatha, smoothing her hands up her thighs.</p><p>She was holding a singular card in her left hand, and at the quirk of Rio’s eyebrow, she flipped it around for her to see.</p><p>It was the Death card.</p><p>Rio flushed.</p><p>She had designed it to match Agatha’s back tattoo, as best she could since she had only seen it once. She had realised last night that she’d done it pretty much perfectly, and thanked her perverted mind for burning the image of Agatha’s bare skin into memory forever.</p><p>‘You weren’t lying when you said you’ve wanted me this whole time,’ Agatha said, shifting her hips in Rio’s lap, rocking into her on purpose.</p><p>Rio’s head fell back with a groan, hitting the edge of the sofa. Agatha talking to her in this way did something twisted to her insides.</p><p>‘Of course I have,’ she replied, a trifle too honestly, not quite befitting the sexual mood. She tugged Agatha down closer, bringing their mouths together. ‘You’re fucking gorgeous, that’s why.’</p><p>That was better.</p><p>Agatha kissed her hard, three times, and it felt like a secret message.</p><p>‘Rio, I don’t know what to say. This is the best gift I’ve ever had in my life, thank you so <em>so</em> much. I don’t know how to thank you properly.’</p><p>Rio smirked. ‘I can think of a few ways.’</p><p>‘Already?’ Agatha hummed. ‘You came in my mouth, oh, forty minutes ago?’</p><p>Rio’s cheeks pinked at Agatha’s dirty language. She was bringing out a whole new side of her.</p><p>Before she could respond, Agatha was kissing her again, opening her mouth a bit to slip her tongue against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio moaned, sucking Agatha’s tongue lightly, and diving her hands into her hair as she was wont to do.</p><p>When they broke apart, Agatha pulled the jumper over her head, leaving her in just the black bra Rio had put on her this morning. She badly wanted to take it off again.</p><p>‘I wanted you too, you know,’ Agatha rasped against her ear, darting her tongue out to trace the whorl of it.</p><p>Rio’s whole body shuddered with desire. And Agatha just kept going.</p><p>‘I touched myself on this sofa. Right here.’</p><p>Rio blew air out between her cheeks. ‘When,’ she managed, her own voice surprising her. She sounded wrecked.</p><p>‘After Frozen, obviously.’</p><p>‘Elsa really got you going, huh?’ Rio joked, dragging a thumb up and down Agatha’s side, watching the goosebumps spring up in its wake.</p><p>‘I think it had something more to do with the girl I’d been dreaming about finally manning up and kissing my neck, but yeah,’ Agatha panted, grinding down against Rio’s crotch. ‘Make a joke about it.’</p><p>Something cracked inside Rio then, and she manoeuvred Agatha tighter against her, drawing her legs around her waist until Agatha was dragging herself wantonly against the hard lines of Rio’s stomach.</p><p>‘Get up,’ Rio said lowly, and Agatha whined in protest, but did as she was told, scrambling up to stand next to the sofa.</p><p>Rio stared at her for a second, marvelling at the full chest flush Agatha was currently sporting, standing there in her bra and pyjama pants. She got up too, skirting around Agatha reaching for her. If Agatha touched her now, she’d lose her nerve.</p><p>Without a word, she crossed to the side of the sofa and began to tug it away from the wall, bending at the knees. The exertion made her grunt, but it came away after a moment’s pulling, wheels squeaking as it came off the wall, into the center of the room. Agatha was standing there, confusion written over her features.</p><p>‘Redecorating?’ she snarked, rude in the way she got when impatient for Rio’s touch.</p><p>Rio reached out a hand to her, gripping her fingers and tugging her close. She kissed her gently, then firmer, hand on her jaw to tip her head back. Agatha shook in her hands, letting Rio take charge.</p><p>Rio kept her right hand clasping Agatha’s jaw to hold her in place, and the other, she slid across her head, scratching lightly at her scalp, until she reached the tie holding Agatha’s ponytail in place.</p><p>She pulled the tie out, letting all Agatha’s beautiful hair spill into her waiting palm.</p><p>Rio cupped the back of Agatha’s head, stroking once, twice, then gathered as much hair as she could into her fist, and pulled. Agatha’s head snapped back into her hand, making her eyes blacken in real time. She was breathing hard into the space between them, mouth open in surprise.</p><p>Rio smirked, holding her in suspension for a moment. Then she cleared her dry throat and spoke.</p><p>‘Turn around and bend over.’</p><p>Agatha gasped, a big, wet, heaving noise, and turned immediately, guided by Rio’s hand in her hair.</p><p>When she didn’t move right away, Rio pressed down on her lower back, the bare skin above her pyjamas, and pushed her until she was bent in half over the sofa. Rio slid a pillow under her hips, and Agatha was instantly squirming, making little whimpering noises and trying to wriggle upwards towards Rio’s hands.</p><p>Rio kept Agatha in place with the palm on her back and used her other hand to unclasp her bra, barely suppressing a whine as Agatha’s breasts were released. She couldn’t see them from this angle, but she couldn’t resist giving one a quick squeeze as she stroked Agatha’s skin. Her nipple was hard and pebbled in Rio’s hand.</p><p>‘Oh god, oh god,’ Agatha was chanting under her breath, making Rio smile, obsessed with the audible evidence of Agatha’s want.</p><p>Rio stepped back and dropped to her knees, directly in front of Agatha’s legs. They were dangling mid-air, a foot or so above the ground.</p><p>Rio paused long enough to find this ridiculously cute.</p><p>Then she hooked her thumbs under Agatha’s waistband and drew her pyjama pants down her legs.</p><p>‘Fuck,’ Rio said, taking in the sight of Agatha, bare and wanting. She hadn’t got off earlier, after eating Rio out, and she was swollen and wet, slick smeared into the curls between her legs.</p><p>Rio stood up and stared, sending a quick thank-you up to Jesus. It felt like her birthday instead of his. From this position, she had the most perfect view of Agatha completely naked and waiting to be touched.</p><p><em>My god, her</em> <em>ass</em>, Rio’s dumb brain supplied.</p><p>She reached out to touch her then, the only sound in the room their intermingled heavy breathing, and a whine from Agatha when Rio’s hand gripped her ass cheek.</p><p>‘I’m gonna fuck you now,’ Rio promised, and Agatha’s hips canted up into her hand.</p><p>‘Please, please, <em>Rio</em>, oh god,’ she babbled, and Rio could see her hands fisted into the fabric of the sofa in an effort to stay still.</p><p>Rio stepped away, taking another moment to admire the view as she tore her own shirt off and shucked her sleep shorts down to her ankles, naked in seconds.</p><p>Agatha was wet enough for her not to waste any time sliding two fingers into her from behind, using her grip on Agatha’s hip to angle her better. They moaned in unison as Rio thrusted inside her, fingers immediately finding the spot that made Agatha scream, raised and puffy from last night’s attention.</p><p>Rio slid to the floor to mouth at her thighs, licking up little bits of slick that had slid down away from where her fingers were working into Agatha, hard long thrusts that she drew out to make her whine even more.</p><p>She kissed up until her mouth was below her fingers, sealing her lips over Agatha’s clit, feeling her legs shake already.</p><p>‘Rio – <em>close</em>,’ Agatha managed, and Rio pulled her mouth away immediately, prompting a hiss.</p><p>‘Come on baby,’ Rio said. ‘Can’t you last a bit longer?’</p><p>Agatha’s answering growl morphed into a moan as Rio’s tongue slipped around her entrance, sliding over her own fingers as she continued to fuck into Agatha.</p><p>She stood up again, positioning her hand right in front of her crotch, nestling her elbow into her lower belly. Then she started to thrust into Agatha with her hips, the motion of her body controlling the movements of her hand and fingers.</p><p>‘Can you feel me?’ Rio rasped. ‘I’m fucking you.’</p><p>Agatha clenched down around her fingers at that, a tremor running through her whole body.</p><p>‘Holy fuck,’ Agatha whined, her nails scratching and scrabbling at the fabric beneath her hands.</p><p>Rio kept going, rocking her hips harder and faster, her own wetness dribbling down her thigh.</p><p>‘Oh god,’ Agatha choked around a particularly loud moan. ‘You’re going to make me come all over my expensive throw pillows.’</p><p>Rio laughed despite herself, the sound punctuated by a particularly rough thrust of her hips.</p><p>‘That’s the plan.’</p><p>She thought of the night before when Agatha’s orgasm had gushed from her in a tiny stream.</p><p>She wanted to make it happen again. She sped up.</p><p><em>‘Rio,’ </em>Agatha keened. Then again, <em>‘Rio,’</em></p><p>When she said her name a third time, Rio realised Agatha was trying to say something. She stopped moving and bent down over her to kiss at the back of her neck. Agatha was sweaty and breathless.</p><p>‘What is it, my love?’ Rio whispered, aware of all the stupid emotion in her voice, but past the point of caring.</p><p>‘Under the bed,’ Agatha heaved out, clearly struggling to talk, and Rio flexed her fingers inside her just to make her moan.</p><p>‘What was that?’</p><p><em>‘Fuck,’</em> she shivered, turning her head to meet Rio’s eyes. ‘The <em>thing</em> I bought myself is under my bed.’</p><p>Rio blinked at her in confusion, before the pieces fell into place.</p><p>‘Oh my god,’ Rio whined. ‘Oh my god.’</p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to smirk, and she tensed around Rio’s fingers deliberately. Somehow she had the upper hand again. When she spoke, the words came out level but her voice betrayed her desire, low and gravelly.</p><p>‘So, do you want to fuck me with a cock, or not?’</p><p>Rio blacked out, eyes rolling into the back of her head.</p><p>‘Fuck, yes.’</p><p>She pulled out of Agatha, making her whine again, and turned and ran from the room, still completely naked.</p><p>She flew up the stairs like a madman, practically sprinting as she tore round the corner and dove to her knees by Agatha’s bed, hunting frantically beneath it. Fifteen long, awful, seconds passed before her hands curled around a box.</p><p>She pulled it out instantly, tearing at the cardboard like a feral animal to get to what was inside.</p><p>Rio had been expecting a vibrator, since Agatha had bought it for herself, but the dildo in the box had a black harness attached to it. Rio nearly fainted for the second time in five minutes, her pulse spiking as she stepped into the loops and pulled it up her legs.</p><p>Of course, it was purple.</p><p>Agatha laughed as soon as she heard Rio come back into the living room.</p><p>‘I think you just beat the Olympic record for the hundred metre sprint.’</p><p>Then she lifted her head to look back at Rio, and her smile dropped, eyes fixing hungrily on the strap-on jutting out from between her legs.</p><p>‘Oh god,’ she said, very quietly, and slumped against the sofa.</p><p>Rio dipped her fingers into herself, gathering up some of the excessive wetness that had pooled at her entrance, lubing the dildo up with her own slick.</p><p>‘You look so fucking good right now,’ she gasped, taking in the sight of Agatha bent over for her, swollen open and waiting.</p><p>‘Rio, <em>please</em>,’ Agatha begged, impatient.</p><p>Rio gripped the base of the strap, stroking it up and down between Agatha’s legs, giving her clit a quick rub with the head of it, making her inhale hard.</p><p>Rio moaned. Agatha’s entrance was actually pulsing, clenching around nothing, a long string of her come dripping out of her.</p><p>‘Fuck Agatha, you’re <em>drenched</em>.’</p><p>Agatha’s reply was lost to a whimper as Rio guided the head of the dildo inside her, gentle at first, then harder as Agatha adjusted to the intrusion.</p><p>Her legs were shaking in earnest now, the skin on the backs of her thighs red and patchy from arousal.</p><p>Rio thrust inside her completely, as far as the strap could go, their hips flush. Their skin slapped together in a sound that made them both groan. Rio did it again.</p><p>‘Not gonna last,’ Agatha slurred, sounding completely out of it already.</p><p>Rio fucked into her harder then, bending down until their whole bodies touched, bare breasts against Agatha’s back. She mouthed at her tattoo, kissing at the skull inked on her skin, offering a little bite to her neck.</p><p>Rio was deeper this way, not hitting the right spot, but pushing further inside her than she could standing up. Besides, she wanted Agatha to hold out a bit longer.</p><p>‘Fuck, I can-’ Agatha gasped. ‘Can feel you in my stomach.’</p><p>Rio’s jaw fell open, and her hand shot down instantly to reach under Agatha’s body.</p><p>Sure enough, when she pressed down over Agatha’s lower belly, she could faintly feel the firm outline of the strap-on inside her. If Rio had even the tiniest bit of stimulation on her clit right now, she thought she could come right away.</p><p>She rocked into Agatha like that a couple more times, pushing into her own hand through Agatha’s belly.</p><p>‘I want to come inside you,’ Rio said, nonsensically.</p><p>It made Agatha jolt. <em>‘Please,’</em> she begged, all sense gone.</p><p>Rio’s thumb stroked Agatha’s stomach once more before she brought her left hand up to tangle in Agatha’s wild hair, using it to raise Agatha’s head up and slot their mouths together. Fucking her like this was literally the closest to heaven Rio thought she could ever possibly be. But it wasn’t going to make Agatha come how she wanted.</p><p>One last kiss, and Rio rocked back onto her feet again, without letting go of her hold on Agatha’s hair. The effect was that Agatha’s entire upper body was lifted off the sofa, her only point of contact with it her waist.</p><p>Like this, Rio could see the side of her face, her breasts and her tattoo.</p><p>An experimental twist of her hips, and Agatha grew slack jawed. Rio could see the flush all down her chest.</p><p>Now she knew she had the right spot, Rio began driving into her again, staring down at the point where she was connected to Agatha, watching her dick disappear inside her again and again, coming out shiny.</p><p>‘You’re taking me so good,’ she panted, and Agatha’s shaking intensified.</p><p>‘So <em>well</em>- uh- needed it, needed you to do this,’ Agatha whined. ‘Rio, I’m – <em>I can’t</em>-,’</p><p>‘You can, <em>you can</em>,’ Rio fucked her harder. ‘Come on baby, let it out for me.’</p><p>Agatha inhaled, sharp and harsh, and Rio reached down with her right hand to rub firmly at her clit with three fingers.</p><p>There was a tearing sound as Agatha ripped the material of the cushion she was holding onto, and then she was wailing, incoherent strings of sentences spilling from her mouth as she started to come on Rio’s cock.</p><p>Rio couldn’t feel her, but she felt like she could, watching in awe as great gushes of wetness sprayed from where they were joined, soaking Rio’s entire hand and the pillow beneath Agatha’s hips.</p><p>Rio kept fucking her through it, drawing out every last drop of Agatha’s orgasm.</p><p>‘There you go,’ Rio inhaled. ‘So beautiful.’</p><p>‘<em>I’m sorry, I’m sorry</em>,’ Agatha was saying, face red and scrunched up, even as more come squirted out, drenching everything.</p><p>It was all over Rio’s stomach and legs.</p><p>When Agatha finally stopped coming and her body went limp, Rio let go of her hair gently, falling over onto her, kissing at all the skin she could reach.</p><p>Her eyes were shut, pink cheeks shining with sweat. Rio licked at it, tasting the salt of her skin.</p><p>She did this to her.</p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes, Rio saw that the black of her pupil had almost completely eradicated any blue in them.</p><p>‘Did you just,’ Rio said conversationally. ‘Correct my grammar during your orgasm?’</p><p>Agatha moaned, long and low.</p><p>‘I’ve never done that before,’ she rasped.</p><p>‘Given a grammar lesson during sex?’ Rio teased. ‘Or the other thing?’</p><p>Agatha glared at her, then softened, wincing. ‘I’m sorry.’</p><p>Rio ground her hips down, still inside of her, making her gasp out.</p><p>‘Oh no, don’t you <em>dare</em> apologise.’ She caught Agatha’s lips with her own. ‘I think I’m in love.’</p><p>Agatha spluttered out a laugh.</p><p>‘<em>Rio</em>.’</p><p>‘What?’ Rio smirked.</p><p>‘You did <em>not </em>just tell me you love me for the first time, still inside of me, after fucking me over the back of the couch.’</p><p>‘Oops,’ Rio said.</p><p>Agatha kissed her gently.</p><p>‘Merry Christmas,’ Rio said then, making Agatha laugh again.</p><p>‘What am I going to do with you?’ Agatha asked, eyes bright with affection.</p><p>Rio blushed, then looked down at her hips where the strap-on was attached.</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>‘Now there’s an idea.’</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio crept down the stairs on Valentine’s Day morning with all the subtlety she could possibly muster.</p><p>As it was, she tripped at the bottom on one of Nicky’s dinosaurs and landed hard on her ass.</p><p><em>‘Fuck,’</em> she hissed under her breath.</p><p>‘Are you okay, baby?’ came a groggy voice from the bedroom she had just painstakingly extricated herself from.</p><p>‘Yes,’ she shouted back, dragging a hand through her messy hair. ‘Go back to sleep!’</p><p>Great start.</p><p>It was their first Valentine’s Day, and Rio was determined to make it Agatha’s best yet. It was sure as hell going to be a sight better than whatever Ralph had attempted before. If he had at all.</p><p>
<em>Ralph. </em>
</p><p>Rio glowered. She didn’t like to think about him any more than she had to. His only benefit to her was his joint custody of Nicky.</p><p>She loved Nicky like a son, but Ralph’s involvement had been more than helpful during the last couple of months as she and Agatha experienced the most intense and horny honeymoon period in all of existence.</p><p>They had had to replace the couch.</p><p>Rio padded barefoot into the kitchen, a sliver of anxiety twisting in her chest.</p><p>It was the day of love - a sentiment she had expressed repeatedly to Agatha - and was yet to receive back.</p><p>It felt like Agatha had come close to saying it a hundred times, and she still called Rio ‘little love’ as her nickname of choice. And yet, never the full statement. Rio tried not to let it bother her, tried to be patient, but today of all days it weighed on her mind. Was this as serious for Agatha as it was for her? Was she merely a placeholder to her, like Ralph had been before she came along?</p><p>‘I don’t love him.’ Agatha had said to her, back at the start, before they’d even kissed. Rio imagined her saying the same about her to some faceless entity. She pictured Agatha’s earnest eyes, a grim expression playing around her mouth as she said it: ‘I don’t love her.’ Her stomach turned.</p><p>She shook her head to clear her thoughts, reaching for the oat milk from the fridge and giving it a harsh shake.</p><p>Rio gathered ingredients for pancakes - flour and sugar and the last dregs of the oat milk.</p><p>When the batter was finished, she had an idea. In the third drawer was a Mickey Mouse cookie cutter, a souvenir from the New Years’ trip they had taken with Nicky to Disneyland. Rio smiled at the sight of it. And yes, if she moved it just right – she thought it would work.</p><p>Rio set the pan on the stove, turning on the flame with a click. She poured the pancake mix in, moving the cookie cutter periodically to create a heart shape – Mickey’s ears each side of the heart.</p><p>The first one was fucked up, as they always are. Rio ate it with her fingers, hot out the pan, burning her tongue. It was good.</p><p>By the third, Rio had to abandon the heart shape idea. They looked more like Mickey if he had been hit by a bus, than accurate lovehearts. When there was a pile of ten or so pancakes on a plate, she covered it with foil and laid it on the dining table. Then she brewed a hearty pot of coffee and poured a jug of orange juice. Finally, she went into the cupboard under the stairs and brought out the bunch of red roses she had hidden there the night before, setting them down in Agatha’s favourite vase.</p><p>Rio had barely finished all this when arms slipped around her from behind. The smile spread across her face before she could stop it.</p><p>‘Morning,’ she said gently, capturing Agatha’s hands in hers where they clasped her stomach.</p><p>‘Hmm,’ Agatha grumbled, kissing the back of Rio’s neck chastely. It sent goosebumps down her arms all the same.</p><p>Rio turned in her embrace, unable to resist threading a hand through Agatha’s hair, attempting to tame it.</p><p>‘It’s getting too long.’ Agatha said. Rio stiffened.</p><p>‘No,’ she whispered.</p><p>‘I’m sorry, love, but I have a hair appointment booked for this afternoon.’</p><p>‘This afternoon?’ Rio’s voice wavered. ‘You’re cutting your hair on Valentine’s Day?’</p><p>Agatha laughed, releasing Rio, and noticed the setup on the dining table for the first time.</p><p>‘Don’t be so dramatic,’ she reprimanded.</p><p>Rio scowled at the thought of a hairdresser with their hands in Agatha’s hair.</p><p>‘I made breakfast,’ she said in a small voice. ‘Happy Valentine’s Day.’</p><p>Agatha beamed, leaning forward to kiss her gently on the lips. ‘Happy Valentine’s Day, Rio.’</p><p>She adjusted her pyjama top, which was actually one of Rio’s vintage oversized graphic t-shirts. It was a white one with a cartoon couple holding hands depicted on it. It said: ‘Men and women are the proof that opposites attract!’ Rio insisted it was hilariously ironic.</p><p>Her eyes were drawn to Agatha’s bare thighs. She didn’t normally come downstairs in this state of undress, and Rio sent up thanks to God that Nicky wasn’t at theirs this weekend.</p><p>Agatha perched on a chair, one leg tucked up, exposing even more thigh. She poured herself a mug of coffee and a glass of orange juice as well as a glass of water, sipping at each periodically. She always had to have a three-drink minimum. It was just one of the many things Rio loved about her.</p><p>Rio took the foil off the pancakes and Agatha stifled a snort.</p><p>‘Are those Mickeys?’</p><p>Rio pouted. ‘They were meant to be hearts.’</p><p>Agatha smiled. ‘Thank you, darling. And thank you for my beautiful flowers.’</p><p>She dipped her head forward and inhaled deeply, sighing out her appreciation. Rio stared at her nose in side-profile, a blush tinging her cheeks at both the image and the noise Agatha had made.</p><p>
<em>What had got into her this morning?</em>
</p><p>‘Although-,’ Agatha’s voice dropped. ‘-they aren’t my favourite roses.’</p><p>‘Oh,’ Rio said. ‘Do you prefer pink ones? I’m sorry.’</p><p>Agatha smirked wickedly and lifted the side of Rio’s tank top, revealing the three roses inked on her rib. Then she ducked close and kissed each one. One of Rio’s hands flew into her hair, the other gripping the table.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ she whined.</p><p>‘Rio,’ Agatha said back, deep and teasing.</p><p>‘Please.’</p><p>‘Please, what?’</p><p>She hadn’t moved, and now her tongue was tracing shapes around Rio’s tattoo, like she was playing dot-to-dot with the lines.</p><p>‘Ungh-,’ Rio moaned inarticulately. ‘I don’t know, just-’</p><p>All at once, Agatha pulled back and resumed eating her pancakes, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Rio sank to her knees beside her on the floor, hands skirting up over her calves until they reached the wide expanse of smooth, soft thigh on offer.</p><p>‘Keep eating your breakfast,’ Rio said in a gravelly voice, and shuffled under the table.</p><p>Agatha sighed happily, wriggling in her chair until she was facing completely forward.</p><p>Once Rio heard her fork scrape her plate from above, she deliberately spread Agatha’s legs with her hands and promptly groaned.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t wearing any underwear.</p><p>She was glistening, already wet under Rio’s attentive palms.</p><p>‘Oh, fuck,’ Rio cursed, dropping her lips to kiss at Agatha’s bare legs.</p><p>Agatha continued eating her pancakes in silence. Rio paused, waiting under the table for a cue.</p><p>After a moment of stillness, Agatha’s ankle hooked around her back and tugged her forward, her face landing just above the curls at the apex of Agatha’s thighs.</p><p><em>‘Good,’</em> Agatha breathed, when Rio’s tongue darted out to lick a stripe across Agatha’s lower belly.</p><p>The singular word made Rio’s entire body jolt.</p><p>‘The pancakes are good,’ Agatha clarified, and Rio growled, digging her thumbs into the softest part of Agatha’s legs and drawing them up and onto her shoulders.</p><p>Then she joined Agatha and began to eat in earnest.</p><p>Rio neglected her clit - the spot she usually paid attention to first - to drag her tongue through the slick gathered around Agatha’s opening. It was rich and sweet, the way she always was first thing in the morning. Rio groaned.</p><p>‘You taste good, too.’</p><p>Agatha was squirming on the chair, playing at unaffected, but growing wetter by the second under Rio’s ministrations.</p><p>‘Fingers,’ she breathed, and then Rio heard her taking a drag of coffee.</p><p>Rio hesitated, waiting for Agatha to shift in impatience. The moment she did, Rio tucked three fingers tight together and thrust them all into Agatha at once with no warning.</p><p>Agatha’s knee jerked up and hit the table, <em>hard</em>.</p><p>‘Fuck, <em>baby</em>,’ she hissed. ‘That’s perfect.’</p><p>Rio preened under the praise. Her knees were starting to burn against the carpet, and she couldn’t have cared less. She wouldn’t have stopped for all the world.</p><p>She started to curl her fingers harder, putting up a relentless pace. Not being able to see Agatha heightened the whole thing somehow, and Rio was rubbing her own thighs together where she knelt.</p><p>Agatha was keening, legs trembling around Rio’s head as she put her mouth to work, lifting Agatha’s hood with her tongue and sucking her clit into her mouth, swirling her tongue around it.</p><p><em>‘Angel,’</em> Agatha breathed out.</p><p>Rio’s face turned scarlet. Over the last couple of months Agatha had discovered Rio’s little proclivity for pet names in bed, and she made frequent use of the knowledge.</p><p>Rio breathed out harshly through her nose, the hot burst of air skating across Agatha’s clit and making her shudder.</p><p>‘Keep going, pet,’ Agatha commanded gently, reaching a hand under the table to dig her fingers into Rio’s hair and caress her face with her thumb.</p><p>Rio doubled her efforts, alternating between quick, targeted swipes of her tongue paired with hard thrusts – this made Agatha moan loud and uninhibited - and the unhurried pressure of her mouth as she sucked on Agatha’s most sensitive skin. When she slowed to suck softly, she ceased the firm curls of her fingers and simply rubbed against the spot inside Agatha that always made her come the hardest. Her legs were shaking, loosening and tightening around Rio’s aching shoulders.</p><p>Agatha was close, she could tell, but still fucking munching on her breakfast, every so often letting out a satisfied hum at the food in her mouth. Rio was determined to make her forget all about the pancakes she had so lovingly crafted.</p><p>She tightened her grip on Agatha’s legs, changing the point of contact from her fingertips to her nails, digging them in. Agatha let out a sharp gasp.</p><p>Rio pulled back from her center and kissed her thigh sweetly, before sucking a harsh bite into the skin. All whilst still moving inside Agatha. Agatha’s hips stuttered.</p><p>‘Fuck, <em>fuck</em>,’ she whispered, from above Rio.</p><p>Rio turned her head and marked the other thigh in a similar fashion.</p><p>‘Harder, baby, harder,’ Agatha urged.</p><p>Rio complied, sinking her teeth down with more force than she had ever used on Agatha before. She accompanied this with a particularly firm rub against the inside of her walls, and she was rewarded by a loud metallic clang, presumably Agatha’s fork dropping from her palm to her plate.</p><p>
<em>Bingo.</em>
</p><p>Agatha dangled on the precipice for nearly a minute, Rio never relenting her movements, or unhooking her teeth from the meat of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Then, taking pity on her, Rio circled her thumb once, twice, over Agatha’s neglected clit. That was all it took for Agatha to come with a wet rush, pulsing all over Rio’s pruned fingers. Rio dug her teeth in harder, sucking with her mouth and soothing the sting with her tongue. It only seemed to prolong Agatha’s orgasm as she kept spilling that sweet liquid directly into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>‘Perfect, perfect, my god, <em>baby</em>,’ Agatha babbled, and Rio gently withdrew.</p><p>She crawled out from under the table, cursing at the burns on her knees and her sore neck.</p><p>‘Come here, angel,’ Agatha beckoned her forth. Rio marvelled at her red cheeks and sweaty forehead.</p><p>‘Are you okay?’</p><p>‘Okay? I don’t know how I’ll top that,’ Agatha laughed. Then her face shifted, and she broke their eye contact.</p><p>‘What is it?’</p><p>‘Nothing. Just thinking about my hair appointment.’</p><p>Rio frowned, pulling away from her girlfriend. ‘Oh, okay.’</p><p>She felt embarrassed - the combination of trying something new with Agatha and her sudden detachment from the situation playing havoc on her nerves. Her lower belly churned with it; a sick concoction paired with the unaddressed desire still burning there. Agatha made no reach for her, simply wiped at herself with a napkin and began compiling a second plate.</p><p>‘Sit, eat.’</p><p>Rio’s heart sank further.</p><p>
<em>Okay. They were really going to pretend that hadn’t just happened. </em>
</p><p>‘I love you, Agatha,’ Rio said quietly, avoiding her gaze as she poured maple syrup over her pancakes.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand and took a sip of juice.</p><p>Rio stared down at the plate in front of her, at the misshapen ‘hearts’ she had made for Agatha.</p><p>It felt poignant.</p><hr/><p>At three, Agatha left for her hair appointment. Rio sulked until three forty, then with a heavy sigh, began to clean the house. It was something to do.</p><p>At four, Agatha texted that she had to cancel their dinner reservations. Rio dropped her phone by her knees as she dusted the skirting-boards. <em>What the fuck?</em> She stopped cleaning out of spite, leaving the duster on the floor.</p><p>She was still wet from this morning and now she felt hurt threatening to spill from her eyes.</p><p>Great, sad <em>and</em> horny.</p><p>Rio gave it up and went upstairs to bed, picking up a pile of books to put away on Nicky’s bookshelf as she went. Then she got under the covers of what she still thought of as Agatha’s bed, curling on her side as she let the tears start to fall.</p><hr/><p>Rio woke to Agatha’s warm palm on her cheek.</p><p>‘Baby?’</p><p>Rio kept her eyes closed resolutely, a pout on her lips. She refused to open them and see Agatha’s new short hair.</p><p>‘Rio, I know you’re awake, you’re blushing.’</p><p>
<em>Damn it.</em>
</p><p>Rio blushed deeper at Agatha’s words, embarrassed at how responsive she still was to her touch, even after months of having it.</p><p>Then she cracked one eye open.</p><p>Her heart lurched, and she scrabbled into a sitting position.</p><p>‘Oh my god, oh my god, <em>oh my god</em>,’ she chanted, clawing around desperately for her phone.</p><p>‘Do you like it?’ Agatha asked shyly.</p><p>She hadn’t cut it after all – it was maybe an inch shorter, just a trim. No, Agatha had had it styled. Her usual frizz had been tamed into soft waves that framed her face, clearly straightened but already curling. The effect was that it seemed like she had <em>more</em> hair than before.</p><p>Rio clicked on to her camera, obsessively taking photos of her, switching over to portrait mode to capture her best.</p><p>As soon as she was done, she rocked forward into her girlfriend.</p><p>‘Can I touch it?’ she asked, sounding half-crazed.</p><p>Agatha reared back. ‘Nuh-uh. I just spent a lot of money on it.’</p><p>Rio resorted to begging instantly. ‘Please. Please, just one touch.’</p><p>Agatha shook her head, laughing at Rio. The movement brought the scent of fresh honey and florals to Rio’s nose, and she groaned.</p><p>‘Is this my Valentine’s gift?’</p><p>Agatha winked. ‘One of them.’ The skin of her face grew several shades deeper.</p><p>Rio bolted upright again, heart stilling in her chest. ‘Okay, and the other?’</p><p>Agatha smiled, reaching out to clasp their hands together. She looked nervous in a way Rio hadn’t seen since the very beginning of their relationship. It made Rio fear what was about to come out of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha sensed this, smoothing her thumb over Rio’s knuckles. ‘Relax. It’s okay.’</p><p>Rio calmed, raising her eyebrow in question.</p><p>‘Do you remember-,’ Agatha began, shifting until she was sitting properly on the bed in front of Rio. ‘-my Christmas gift?’</p><p>Rio nodded slowly. ‘The tarot cards?’</p><p>Agatha looked away. ‘The other.’</p><p>‘What-?’ Rio stopped. ‘Oh. Yes, your little <em>friend</em>.’</p><p>The irony of using those two words was not lost on Rio, as the purple strap-on could hardly be described as little, and the things it had done to Agatha were <em>not</em> things one does with a friend. They didn’t use it often, but when they did, everything was heightened to an intense degree. It was always rough and desperate, just as good as that first time on the couch. The memory made Rio’s chest burn.</p><p>‘I’ve bought you another.’</p><p>Rio’s smile dropped. ‘Oh god,’ she whined, eyes practically rolling back in her head. ‘You’re going to kill me one of these days.’</p><p>Agatha grinned and dropped to her knees. The view made Rio’s stomach lurch, before she realised Agatha was simply reaching for something under the bed. She pulled out a box, tongue working at her lip as she tore it open. Rio was transfixed.</p><p>Agatha’s face was scarlet as she held up the dildo. Rio’s gaze fell upon it hungrily, tracing the outline. It was longer than the purple one, but thinner. Rio couldn’t wait to fuck Agatha with it.</p><p>‘Put it on me,’ she ordered, her voice scratchy and low.</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a very long time. Then she set the dildo gently down on the carpet and pulled her shirt off. She was wearing a new purple bra that Rio had never seen before, and the sight of it had her aching to touch.</p><p>‘Agatha, you’re perfect.’</p><p>Agatha smirked, trailing her hands over herself until she reached her waistband, sliding off her jeans. She was wearing a matching thong, and Rio started shifting uncomfortably on the edge of the bed.</p><p>‘Please,’ she whispered, pressing her thighs together for some relief. It didn’t alleviate the ache - it only made things worse.</p><p>‘Hold still,’ Agatha murmured, and reached forward to pull down Rio’s trousers. They joined the growing pile of clothes on the floor next to her. Agatha left Rio’s underwear on, bending down to kiss at her wet spot, drawing a sharp inhale from her girlfriend.</p><p>Then she rocked back onto her heels, loosening the straps of the harness until the loops were big enough to slide up Rio’s tanned legs. Rio was trembling against her, shaking with anticipation.</p><p>Agatha tightened the loops, a wicked glint in her eye as she looked up at Rio from her knees at the edge of the bed. Rio saw in her face what she was about to do seconds before she did it.</p><p>Agatha spread her palms over Rio’s thighs, shuffling forward until she was directly in front of her. Then she made startling, piercing eye contact, softened her features into a sultry expression, and stuck her tongue out, giving the length of the strap-on a lick.</p><p>Rio clung to consciousness like a life-raft.</p><p>‘Oh, <em>holy fuck</em>, Agatha, you’re not real,’ she breathed, gripping the sheets as hard as she could.</p><p>Agatha smiled, gripping the base of it in her fist. Then she planted a chaste kiss on the tip, flicking her eyes to Rio’s rapidly blackening ones as she opened her mouth with a soft inhale, and drew the head into her mouth.</p><p>The visual was immediately so intense and overpowering to Rio’s senses that she feared she’d come untouched.</p><p>‘Agatha,’ she managed, pushing at her shoulder with one feeble hand.</p><p>Agatha pulled off, a string of saliva connecting her lips to Rio’s cock.</p><p>‘What?’ she pouted. ‘I’m not allowed to suck my boyfriend off on Valentine’s Day?’</p><p>Rio’s pulse stopped and her breath hitched.</p><p>All that came out of her mouth when she tried to speak was a long and drawn-out whine.</p><p>Agatha sometimes said things like that during sex, but only very rarely.</p><p>It drove Rio crazy.</p><p>Picking the strap up by the base, Agatha manoeuvred it until it rested directly over Rio’s clit through her sodden underwear. She ducked her head again, enveloping the strap with her tongue and sucking, rocking the base against Rio.</p><p>‘Fuck, <em>fuck</em>,’ Rio gasped. ‘I’m not gonna last.’</p><p>Agatha hesitated with a smirk. ‘You never do on the first one. And I want more time for your second.’</p><p>‘Oh my god,’ Rio moaned, and Agatha gave her a hard, dirty rub with the strap.</p><p>‘I love your cock, baby,’ she whispered, hollowing her cheeks as she sucked. Rio couldn’t resist tilting her hips up to get further inside her mouth, whining when Agatha choked a little.</p><p>She felt her orgasm building way too quickly and her vision started whiting out. On instinct, she dug her hands into Agatha’s hair and tugged.</p><p>Agatha pulled off and turned her head to the side, striking like a rattlesnake and biting into Rio’s thigh, exactly as Rio had done to her that morning. At the same time, she rubbed at her through her underwear, giving her the perfect friction to tip her over the edge.</p><p>Rio’s whole body shuddered as she came, falling backwards onto the bed and letting out a guttural groan.</p><p>As soon as she was done, Agatha was crawling all over her, mouthing at her body until she met her lips in a rough kiss.</p><p>‘Don’t touch my hair again,’ she warned, soothing the admonishment with her lips on Rio’s neck, sucking a dark mark into the crook between her shoulder and her collarbone.</p><p>‘Uh-,’ Rio gasped, still reeling.</p><p>Agatha drew her earlobe into her mouth, biting down until Rio whined. When she managed to speak, her voice was totally wrecked.</p><p>‘Agatha, please, you <em>have</em> to let me fuck you.’ Rio punctuated this with a sharp pump of her hips, the spit from Agatha’s mouth smearing against her stomach as the strap brushed her skin.</p><p>‘Oh, love,’ Agatha smiled, turning until she was lying on her side, resting her head in her palm.</p><p>‘You didn’t think it was for you, did you?’</p><p>Rio blinked, still trying to catch her breath. ‘What?’</p><p>‘Rio,’ Agatha said, low and close. ‘You still haven’t let me fuck you like that.’</p><p>Rio went red all down her neck and up to the tips of her ears.</p><p>‘I didn’t think you’d-,’ she started, rubbing at her face with her hand. ‘I mean, I’ve never-’</p><p>‘Shh,’ Agatha interrupted. ‘Do you want me?’</p><p>Rio nodded so fast her neck clicked. ‘More than anything.’</p><p>‘Okay,’ Agatha murmured, reaching down between them to loosen the straps and free Rio’s thighs.</p><p>Rio watched, mesmerised, as she rolled on to her back and pulled the loops onto her own legs, tightening them with expert precision.</p><p>At Rio’s incredulous look, she pinked. ‘I practised.’</p><p>Rio felt very raw all of a sudden, every nerve ending exposed.</p><p>‘Here, honey,’ Agatha lifted Rio’s upper body easily and set her down on the pillow. There were goosebumps all over her arms, spreading across her stomach at Agatha’s touch.</p><p>‘Are you ready?’ Agatha steeled her with a look, biting back a smile at Rio’s black, feral eyes and red cheeks.</p><p>‘Please,’ she managed, trembling beneath the older woman.</p><p>‘Can you be my good girl and keep those hands out of my hair?’ Agatha husked, settling her weight over Rio and tugging off her shirt.</p><p>Rio moaned. ‘Yes.’</p><p>Agatha peeled Rio’s ruined underwear off her overheated skin and Rio kicked them away across the room.</p><p>‘Okay, my sweetheart,’ Agatha whispered. ‘Deep breath in.’</p><p>Rio acquiesced, inhaling until she couldn’t anymore, then blowing out gently. Near the end of her exhale, Agatha gripped her hip, angled her slightly, and slid in one fell move all the way inside.</p><p><em>‘Oh,’ </em>Rio moaned. ‘<em>Fuck</em>, that’s good.’</p><p>The smaller girth of the dildo meant she felt no pain, only a deeply satisfying sense of fullness as Agatha pushed into her.</p><p>‘Yeah?’ Agatha panted, pulling out slowly before thrusting back inside.</p><p>‘Yes, <em>yes</em>, yes,’ Rio whined, eyes clamped shut and gripping the sheets in an effort not to touch Agatha’s hair.</p><p>‘Open your eyes, angel,’ Agatha commanded, and Rio obeyed.</p><p>Agatha was gazing down from above her with an expression that could only really be described as utter devotion. Her blue eyes were wet with unspent emotion, and she nodded reassuringly at Rio.</p><p>‘I wish I could feel you,’ Agatha said. ‘For real.’</p><p>Rio tensed around the strap, hooking Agatha in closer with an ankle. Then she raised her hand to Agatha’s face, brushing at her cheek with a thumb. The moment held, then Rio whispered back.</p><p>‘You can.’</p><p>She slipped her thumb into Agatha’s mouth, pressing down on her tongue until Agatha gasped out around it, sucking greedily. Her hips stuttered into Rio, and she moaned.</p><p>‘I love-,’ she panted, talking around Rio’s thumb. ‘-I love fucking you.’</p><p>Rio moaned around a particularly harsh thrust. ‘I love-,’ she echoed, driving her thumb further into Agatha’s mouth. ‘I love you fucking me.’</p><p>Rio pulled her thumb from Agatha’s mouth with a pop, held her face for a half-second, then drove both hands into her hair.</p><p>‘Nuh-uh,’ Agatha chastised, stilling her movements and shaking her head until Rio’s hands fell away. ‘No touching.’</p><p>Rio whined. ‘Please.’</p><p>Agatha lifted an eyebrow. ‘Do you need a little extra help to behave?’</p><p>Before Rio could reply in the negative, Agatha slipped out of her, making her whine in frustration.</p><p>Agatha stalked across the room, the wet strap bobbing as she walked. Rio marvelled at her total lack of self-consciousness - at the huge leaps and bounds she had made with her confidence in the last few months.</p><p>Agatha tore the closet door open, pulling out the suit Rio had had laundered for Valentine’s Day. It was still wrapped in the plastic and Agatha ripped it unceremoniously.</p><p>‘Hey,’ came Rio’s weak protest.</p><p>Agatha rooted around in the plastic, face lighting up as she found her mark. She met Rio’s eyes across the room as her fist tightened around something and she pulled it out. It was Rio’s tie, black silk. She hadn’t had the chance to wear it yet.</p><p>‘Agatha.’</p><p>‘Yes, my love?’ Agatha dropped back onto the bed on her knees, crawling over to where Rio was lying.</p><p>‘Please,’ Rio whimpered.</p><p>‘Hands out in front of you,’ Agatha ordered, and Rio offered her wrists so fast she nearly hit her.</p><p>With a faux innocent smile, Agatha wrapped the silk tie around both of Rio’s wrists twice, knotting the material and pulling it taut.</p><p>Then she pressed Rio back down onto the pillows by her shoulder, took both her knees and placed them over her hips, and pushed back into her. The angle was instantly better – so perfect that Rio felt her whole body start like an engine being jumped with cables. She realised from some far-away, logical portion of her brain that she was going to come like this, just from the internal stimulation Agatha was giving her.</p><p>The older woman bent over her, trailing her hair teasingly down Rio’s burning body, pausing at her nipples to drag it over them. Rio whined quietly, and Agatha deemed this inadequate. She unhooked Rio’s bra by the clasp at the front and dipped close to suck a nipple into her mouth, swirling her tongue around it as she continued fucking into her.</p><p>Rio struggled against the restraint, desperate to get her hands back in Agatha’s hair. After a moment of trying, she wriggled one wrist free, immediately burying her fingers into it. Agatha tutted sharply and stopped. Leaning in, she tugged on the tail end of the tie until it came completely loose, grasping Rio’s hands firmly and moving them until they were clasped behind her back. Then she re-tied the tie.</p><p>She bent to whisper in Rio’s ear. ‘Turn over, darling.’</p><p>Rio flipped onto her stomach so fast that Agatha slid out of her, the green silicone coated with the white of Rio’s slick.</p><p>Rio on her knees, hips keening up, hands bound tight behind her back, wordlessly begging for Agatha to re-enter her, was a sight she wouldn’t forget any time soon. It was an image that belonged in the Louvre.</p><p>Agatha paused, admiring her. The delay was insufferable to Rio, who began whining beneath her.</p><p>‘Please, Agatha, <em>please</em>,’ she begged.</p><p>Agatha delivered a compact little smack to her left asscheek. Rio tensed, and Agatha faltered, worried she’d gone too far.</p><p>Then Rio moaned, long and low.</p><p>‘Do that again please.’</p><p>Agatha rubbed the rapidly reddening skin. Her right hand gripped Rio’s hip and her left came down hard over the mark on Rio’s ass as she slid back into her at the exact same moment.</p><p>‘Fuck!’ Rio cursed, knees giving way until she was slumped on the bed.</p><p>This angle allowed Agatha to hit her G-spot consistently, and the tell-tale full body rash Rio always sported before coming began to spread across her back.</p><p>‘Oh-kay,’ Agatha heaved, manhandling Rio until she was on her back again, rotating her on her cock without ever pulling out of her.</p><p>Rio stared at her, brown eyes hooded and crazed. ‘Why’d you stop?’</p><p>‘You were going to come.’ Agatha said matter-of-factly.</p><p>‘And?’</p><p>‘And-,’ Agatha’s tongue darted out to lick the sweat from her upper lip. ‘I want to see your face when you do. I want to be looking at you.’</p><p>Rio softened. She opened her mouth to return the sentiment, and Agatha began to fuck her harder. All thoughts ceased to exist in the well of desire that was Rio Vidal’s brain. She was a mindless thing; existing purely for Agatha and her body.</p><p>Agatha’s left hand came up to grasp Rio’s neck in a very light grip. Rio moaned, raising her head up until there was more pressure against her throat. The stimulation emotionally overwhelmed her until she was very suddenly on the precipice of tears.</p><p>Agatha noticed immediately, pulling her hand away and cradling Rio’s face gently, catching the first tear with her thumb.</p><p>‘Oh, angel,’ she sighed. She stilled for a second, making light work of unbinding Rio’s wrists.</p><p>‘Here, little love,’ whispered Agatha, guiding Rio’s fingers into her hair.</p><p>Rio breathed, the tears streaming in quick succession down her blotchy face. She tightened her grip in Agatha’s hair, endlessly comforted and aroused by it.</p><p>‘You’re beautiful,’ Agatha promised, thrusting slow and gentle now, still catching Rio’s tears with her fingers.</p><p>Rio gave a shudder at that, clenching hard around Agatha. ‘I’m close,’ she gasped.</p><p>‘You can come when you need to, baby,’ Agatha soothed. ‘I’m here.’</p><p>Rio felt her orgasm building in her belly as Agatha continued her movements, rocking into her with consistent, gentle thrusts. Rio couldn’t usually come without clitoral stimulation, but this was Agatha. Agatha who could make her wet with just one look, Agatha who took her apart completely with every single touch, Agatha whom she loved.</p><p>‘I love you,’ Rio heaved out, all in a rush.</p><p>Agatha sighed in contentment and brought their lips together sweetly.</p><p>‘My Rio,’ she whispered. ‘<em>Gorgeous</em> girl.’</p><p>Rio’s body started to shake apart beneath her, and Agatha’s grip on her face turned firm, her blue eyes dark and serious. There were two high splotches of colour on her cheeks as she fucked into Rio, ever so tender.</p><p>Rio tiltered on the edge, seconds away from her orgasm washing over her and consuming everything. If only she could just-</p><p>‘Rio, my darling-’ Agatha started, her voice cracking with emotion. 

</p><p>‘-I love you.' 

</p><p>Rio gasped, loud and breathy in the suddenly quiet room. ‘Oh,’ she whispered. Then her body cracked like a whip, and she was coming, coming, <em>coming</em>, all over Agatha’s cock.</p><p>The orgasm wrenched a scream from her, the pleasure so insanely, blindingly strong that she thought she might pass out. Agatha cradled her through it, never ceasing her gentle grind until Rio stopped her with a palm to her lower back.</p><p>Rio’s hands shook as she came down. When she opened her eyes into Agatha’s teary ones, she let out the sob that had been building for the last ten minutes.</p><p>‘Shhhh,’ Agatha instantly comforted her, lifting her into a hug, Rio’s bare breasts pressing against her chest.</p><p>‘Do you really?’ Rio choked out.</p><p>Agatha set her down with an incredulous look.</p><p>‘Of course I do.’</p><p>‘Why didn’t you-,’ Rio began, and Agatha moved to pull out. ‘No.’ Rio’s tone was desperate, insistent in her face and voice. ‘Stay inside me for a little bit.’</p><p>Agatha moaned, lowering herself into Rio’s arms.</p><p>‘Why didn’t you say it before?’ Rio asked, hating the whine in her tone. She stroked the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>‘I don’t know that I’ve ever felt it before.’ Agatha kissed Rio’s brow. ‘Not really. Not before you. With you, it came as naturally as breathing. It came to me so naturally that I didn't know what it was. And now, it feels as if it's always been there. Always been a part of me.’</p><p>‘Say it again,’ Rio pleaded.</p><p>‘I love you,’ said Agatha. ‘I love you so much it scares me. I love you beyond the furthest reaches of reason. You came into my life and it’s like it’s finally begun.’</p><p>Rio’s tears gave way to a wide smile, the gap in her tooth shining through as she beamed down at Agatha.</p><p>‘I love you too.’</p><p>Agatha dropped a kiss on her lips and pulled back with a mirroring expression of joy. ‘I know.’</p><p>A moment of peace.</p><p>Rio inhaled and opened her mouth to speak.</p><p>‘Agatha, will you ma-,’</p><p>Agatha squeaked, clapping a hand over Rio’s lips and cutting her off. ‘Rio!’</p><p>‘What?’ Rio smirked, voice muffled through Agatha’s palm. ‘I was going to ask you to make me a snack.’</p><p>Agatha stared, and the wordless communication in the gaze that passed between them solidified everything.</p><p>When she spoke, her tone was reverent.</p><p>‘What do you want?’</p><p>Rio smiled, and answered.</p>
