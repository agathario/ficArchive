<p>Agatha would later say that she didn’t remember anything from that night. She remembers going out to a nearby bar with one of her friends and ordering a bit too much fancy red wine. Seeing Rio across the bar with a group of friends. Eventually joining them as her drinks started adding up and her drunken state getting the best of her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em>would</em> and she <em>could</em> say that that’s the last thing she remembers. And it is. At least for a few seconds after waking up the morning after with a dangerous headache and mouth so dry it could be the Sahara.</p><p> </p><p>She reaches for her glass of water on the nightstand that she apparently gave herself sometime last night. Saying an appreciative thank you to herself, she’s suddenly startled by a movement from the other side of the bed. Slowly, she turns around to see what’s going on and investigate the movement’s source.</p><p> </p><p>Like a tidal wave everything comes crashing back. It hits her so suddenly that she freezes, trying to keep up with her own mind.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly she pieces together the fragments of memories scattered from the night before. She remembers slow, delicate, touches at the bar leading her to eventually ask Rio home. A messy make out and a few orgasms later she fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs heavily. Rio, her colleague, is off limits. Agatha had rules for herself that she did not cross no matter what, this being one of them. Doesn't matter how attractive the colleague happens to be.</p><p> </p><p>Not even mentioning the fact that Rio is 12 years younger than her, Rio being 36 and Agatha 48. It irked Agatha the wrong way and she felt something twist in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Chugging down the rest of her water, she quickly got out of bed and put on a robe to hide her naked body. From whom she did not know. Rio had <em>clearly</em> seen it all last night.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps she hid from her own consciousness. Feeling regret and shame wash over her with the same force all the memories had come crashing in just mere moments earlier.</p><p> </p><p>She moves through her apartment with an unfamiliarity, even though it’s her own. She almost doesn’t recognise herself in the mirror. She hated it.</p><p> </p><p>It was like someone else meets her eyes in the mirror. Everything about her appearance reminded her of the great time she had Rio had last night. Rio, her colleague, she reminded herself again with a grunt.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes look foggy and tired, but there’s no denying the glint behind the first layer. Almost animalistic, like a physical stain from last night that wont rid itself.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to run her fingers through her tangled hair, only to find it impossible. Sighing in annoyance, she looks in the mirror again, contemplating what to do. She breathes slowly for a moment, just looking at herself in the mirror, trying to find some ground.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers move slowly over her lips, as if trying to find some evidence of last night plastered on them. They’re a bit swollen, and she can remember the feeling of Rio’s own lips against hers so vividly she has to take a step back.</p><p> </p><p>Bothered, she makes her way towards the kitchen. Coffee felt essential.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the first time she’s had a one night stand over - far from it. She wasn’t the commitment type of person, and so taking a woman home for a good fuck sometimes never felt beyond her morale.</p><p> </p><p>This one did.</p><p> </p><p>Taking a big sip of her black coffee, she relaxes back into the couch in the living room-kitchen area before footsteps suddenly shift her attention to the wide door opening leading into her bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is standing there, leading against the doorframe with a tired look on her face and wearing one of Agatha’s t-shirts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated how attractive Rio could look, even unintentionally. She was yawning with her hair in a bun and a confused look on her face, as if she didn’t know where she was. And yet, Agatha couldn’t take her eyes off of her. Agatha loathed her for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning.” Rio eventually breaks the silence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha responds with a fabricated indifference. “Morning.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have coffee?” Rio asks while rubbing her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Dismissively, Agatha answers. “Kitchen counter.” She needed Rio out of this apartment, and she needed it soon.</p><p> </p><p>As Rio moves around in Agatha’s kitchen with such confidence, the word colleague has to be repeated like a mantra in Agatha’s brain.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to keep this professional somehow. She had no idea how exactly, she’s never accidentally slept with a colleague before. But if there’s one thing Agatha’s good at, it’s turning her feelings off like a power switch.</p><p> </p><p>Which is exactly what she does as Rio takes her mug and moves towards the living room area to sit down in an armchair opposite Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The silence creates a tension so thick Agatha wishes she could grab one of her kitchen knives and cut through it.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing Rio this quiet was unsettling on so many levels. Primarily because she was never fucking quiet, always whistling, humming or speaking. Agatha does find it annoying most times, but now, when Rio was quiet, that was somehow even more annoying. Secondly, last night was something they needed to talk about. They both needed to come to an agreement to never speak of it again, act as if it never even happened.</p><p> </p><p>As far as everyone else should be concerned, at the very least.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew that she probably had to be very clear about that.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we agree on something?” Agatha finally breaks the silence after a few excruciating minutes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio looks up to meet Agatha’s eyes, a challenge. They stay like that, if only for a moment, just watching each other closely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhales and finally speaks again. “Last night didn’t happen, as far as we or anyone else should be concerned,” It shouldn’t be this complicated, it shouldn’t have happened, she thinks to herself. A wave of regret comes crashing over her again.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, my lips are sealed, Agatha.”.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs. “See it’s when you do that…” She gestures towards the smirk that appeared on Rio’s face. “That I- Are we on the same page here, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio eventually gives in, “Yes, okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean it,” Agatha says harshly, still not letting Rio free from her piercing stare. Hoping none of this would be lost in translation later, she adds “No one can know that I-“</p><p> </p><p>“That you what? Fucked a colleague?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is thrown off guard by how Rio cuts her off so abruptly. “Yeah,” she sighs after a while. Hand rubbing the back of her neck to calm herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward in the chair, forearms on her knees, not once releasing Agatha from her gaze “Don’t worry Agatha, I won’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha quickly downs the rest of her coffee before standing up. “Then I’ll see you Monday morning.” She says, once again dismissively, hoping Rio would get the hint and get a move on.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Rio is the one who looks thrown off guard, before she smirks - making Agatha loathe her even more. “What, no goodbye kiss?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh don’t be ridiculous.” Agatha scoffs, and turns to make a beeline for the kitchen to place her mug in the dishwasher.</p><p> </p><p>When she finishes cleaning up in the kitchen a few minutes later, Rio is gone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She’s left by the kitchen counter, head in her hands with her entire guard falling down.</p><p> </p><p>Thankful that she’s alone.</p><p> </p><p>She knew deep down that she’s probably overreacting. People slept with their colleagues all the time, even married their colleagues. It should not be this big of a deal, not for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>But for Agatha it felt different. At work she had this facade that she worked her best to uphold. It had worked great for her career, people held a certain respect for her in the detective sphere.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha was ashamed of her night with Rio, she just had too much respect for her job - and her job had too much respect for her. That would all crumble from beneath her if this ever got out. Or that’s at least what she imagines would happen.</p><p> </p><p>It’s a terrifying thought to have, and so Agatha shakes it off, moving towards the shower. She was torn between the urge to never shower again, to have Rio’s touch stay on her forever, or shower and scrub her entire body so delicately no trace of their night together would be left.</p><p align="center">________</p><p> </p><p>Monday mornings were for a lot of people the most anxious time of the week. Agatha never really understood that. Work had always been her escape, ever since her son died 20 years ago. Which is a long time but it still haunts her whenever she’s alone with her thoughts for too long.</p><p> </p><p>She was 28 at the time, had given up her entire 20s to raise a kid that she loved very dearly. She raised him alone, so she had no one to grieve with after his death. It was a brutal few years, afterwards.</p><p> </p><p>Therapy is bullshit and it did not work for her. At least that’s what she told herself after meeting a therapist for over two years with no healing process whatsoever. Her therapist told her that she had too many defense mechanisms and that’s why it wouldn’t work - unless she wanted it to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought that was bullshit too.</p><p> </p><p>When she’s standing in her hallway, coat and shoes on but still making no move to walk outside, she understands people's anxiety. Of course, this was for another reason. She’s never once felt anxious to go to the office, but right now, she’d do anything to call in sick.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she is sick? She feels like she’s about to throw up. That’s a sign, right?</p><p> </p><p>With a heavy sigh she opens the front door.</p><p> </p><p>To say she was nervous would be an understatement. She was anxious, stressed out. Not because she had a problem facing Rio, no. Those feelings she stashed away the second she woke up yesterday, never to be seen again.</p><p> </p><p>However, she was nervous about what Rio could say to the others.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was nothing if not a talker, which made the entire situation more difficult. Agatha could not predict what Rio would say, and that gave her anxiety as well.</p><p> </p><p>A situation regarding her that she didn’t have control over? A nightmare. Agatha needed to be the woman in control, always. It’s where she thrived. It’s where she felt the most comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>She felt powerless.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Half an hour later, she walks into the office with her head held high. A few casual “good morning” greetings to a few officers outside of her own detective team by the coffee machine before making her way into the conference room at the very end of the office.</p><p> </p><p>First to arrive at the morning meeting, as usual, she sits down at the head of the table by the whiteboard. Carefully, she starts organizing her papers for the missing persons case she and her team have been put on.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning.” Lilia greets her when she walks in five minutes later.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just gives an acknowledging nod in her direction before going back to reading the latest updates on the case.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda Maximoff. Woman in her late 20s had been found in a forest in southern New England. The Boston department had been put on the case because, after further investigation, it was found out that the body had been moved across state lines.</p><p> </p><p>Two more members of the team, Alice and Billy, walk in a moment later. Each with a cup of coffee in their hand and chatting about their weekend escapades.</p><p> </p><p>They were the youngest of the team. Alice being 28 and Billy just left university last year. They were green. Agatha thought it was just a matter of time before Billy would eventually crack under the pressure. But he never seemed to, not even after seven months of highly trying work.</p><p> </p><p>As the last two team members walk into the conference room, it isn’t the mere presence of Rio that makes Agatha turn her attention towards the door. Frankly she’d rather not have looked up at all.</p><p> </p><p>But the conversation was far too intriguing. Her ears perk up as she listens. She doesn’t quite get an understanding of what they’re talking about - but hearing Saturday night mentioned is enough for her stomach to churn.</p><p> </p><p>“Detective Kale,” Agatha greets, trying to cut their conversation short. After swallowing and taking a moment to breathe and restabilize, “Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>“Harkness,” Jennifer answers, “Rio here was just telling me about her lovely adventures this weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is left in a state of shock, piercing her eyes through Rio so intensely it could kill. She already told Kale? Not even a minute after entering the office?” Disbelief would be an understatement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio simply looks back at her, not a single emotion displayed on her face. It aggravates Agatha even more.</p><p> </p><p>“Really? With who?” Alice asks. Agatha wants to sink beneath the table. She’d rather not sit here while the news are being announced. <em>Agatha Harkness is not a professional, she doesn’t care about workspace boundaries</em> - she can hear it, her reputation she’s upheld for the last decade decaying beneath her as the rumors start spreading.<em> The leader for one of the best performing detective teams in the states slept with her colleague? A scandal for the headlines.</em></p><p> </p><p>But then she sees Rio smirk, “secret.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t deny the relief that washes over her in that moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio then sits down by the table at the other end, opposite Agatha, trying to meet her eyes. Agatha refuses, looking down at the papers to look preoccupied.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh come on now,” Jen says, nudging her on. “At least tell me if the sex was good?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately looks up in a state of shock from the bold question. But it is intriguing at its nature - who wouldn’t be interested in knowing that?</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it was okay.” Rio says almost tauntingly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha instantly snorts at the lie, but tries to not let the anger get the best of her. She meets Rio’s eyes with such intensity that it could cut through concrete.</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughs, “Only okay? What a disappointment.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, wanting to divert the attention from the conversation at hand clears her throat to speak up, “Shall we?” She asks, nodding towards the papers in her hand, hoping they would all get the gist.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay so Wanda Maximoff, age 28, was found in a forest in Garden State. We went over this case a lot last week, but we have new information that could lead us to believe that this was a suicide, not homicide - which earlier believed was the case.”</p><p> </p><p>“How so?” Rio asks, intrigued.</p><p> </p><p>“I was getting to it,” Agatha answers between her teeth, still not over how ridiculed she felt from Rio’s earlier statement. She was once again able to feel the tension between them, something unspoken. It was unnerving. “All our suspects have alibis, and after getting a brief overview of Wanda’s history with grief and depression from her psychiatrist - it is believed that we have enough reason to suspect a suicide. But the investigation is still on.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts, “Okay, so explain then how and, most importantly, <em>why</em> she was moved all the way from Boston to New Jersey?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s where I’m short, Detective Vidal. I don’t know. Which is why we’re gonna find that out.” Agatha answers impatiently. She really didn’t appreciate Rio’s curiosity. Not ever. Especially not today.</p><p> </p><p>“I hardly think this is appropriate for an investigation? Shouldn’t we be leaving this to some other team that deals with this type of stuff?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know, Vidal. If you really want to know, ask someone else.” Agatha sighs, standing up to start drawing a mind map on the board - briefly going over all the details they already know, but most importantly, she accounts for what they don’t know. Yet. And what they eventually need to figure out.</p><p> </p><p>About an hour later, the team is dismissed on Agatha’s command and they start walking towards their desks outside of the conference room.</p><p> </p><p>Much to Agatha’s dismay, Rio happens to be slower than everyone else while gathering her things. Agatha turns abruptly to walk out when she hears her name being called from behind her.</p><p> </p><p>She stops in her tracks, but not making an effort to look back at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio hurries before Agatha can change her mind and walk out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer her, instead standing in silence by the doorway. Her attention solely on Rio, she just doesn’t want to show it. She decides to give Rio a few seconds of benefit of the doubt, it could so be that she wants to ask something about the case.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she should’ve known better, because seconds later Rio starts speaking again: “It was great.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns around, confused for a second before she puzzles the pieces together.</p><p> </p><p>Rio simply smirks. She makes her way towards Agatha. At first, Agatha is worried of what she might do. Rio's eyes are looking at her with such intensity and intent that Agatha really isn’t sure what her motivations are in this moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio playfully bumps her shoulder into Agatha as she crosses the threshold and walks out. Leaving Agatha completely stunned for a few seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivers in annoyance. She knew what Rio was referring to, but the fact that she even dared to even bring it up, not to mention while in the office, was enough to make Agatha want to strangle her.</p><p> </p><p>Cracking her neck nonchalantly she makes a beeline towards her own office, where she would finally be able to find a little more peace and quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Closing the door behind her, she lets out a heavy breath with her head against the wooden door. A few peaceful seconds go by in silence, while Agatha could just come to terms with the situation at hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a pain in the ass normally. Asking too many questions, having way too much fun with disturbing cases that even Agatha found appalling.</p><p> </p><p>But <em>today</em>, Rio had become like a nuclear disaster. Threatening her peace in every possible way. Even more so because she worked as a constant reminder of her misstep from this weekend. And to top it all off - she couldn’t even find the dignity to be quiet about it? Instead she seemed determined to taunt Agatha in front of everyone to spur a reaction.</p><p> </p><p>It was enough to make Agatha’s blood boil.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>About six important phone calls later Agatha leaves her office to debrief with Lilia, who was working on finding known associates to the victim.</p><p> </p><p>On her way over to Lilias desk, she finds Rio standing talking to Jen, and so she decides to join their conversation. She suddenly had the overwhelming urge to be present at all conversations with Rio’s. So she wouldn’t accidentally bring up their night together, of course.</p><p> </p><p>“You need to start seeing someone, Rio, we’re both 36 years old - at least I have a partner.”</p><p> </p><p>And oh, Agatha could claw Jen’s eyes out for that. But instead she approaches them with feign confidence. “Shouldn’t you be overviewing the mud samples, Kale?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s 9 am on a Monday morning. Cut us some slack, Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply scoffs. “Well then, what could be more important than helping me solve the case of an innocent woman lying dead in a crick in a random forest?”</p><p> </p><p>“Finding Rio a date.” Jen says so nonchalantly it’s off putting, even for Agatha - and she’s not usually the most empathetic person.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, “I’m fine, Jen, I told you.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a shame because oops,” Jen holds up her phone to display an sms conversation, “I’ve already booked us on a double date for tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“During working hours Jen? Highly unprofessional of you.” Agatha says strictly, before making a show of turning around to go back to the reason she went out of her office in the first place - Lilia.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the day Agatha was in a bad mood. She couldn’t put her finger on exactly what got her this worked up - acting more aggressive and irritable than usual.</p><p> </p><p>She <em>knows</em> deep down that it is highly suspicious that the switch happened around the time she found out Rio was going on a date. But to be fair to herself this entire day had been very demanding.</p><p> </p><p>A call from an old friend of Maximoff's took a heavy toll on her because, to be quite frank, it was a heartbreaking story. All the while she couldn’t move around the office with the same confidence and indifference she usually could.</p><p> </p><p>But it did sting in her that Rio was gonna see someone else tonight.</p><p> </p><p>It isn’t fair. She hates herself for feeling that way. But she hates Rio even more for <em>making</em> her feel that way.</p><p> </p><p>She knows that she actively dismissed Rio yesterday morning. That she made it very clear that she didn’t want it to happen again. And she reinstated that belief this morning as well when Rio left the conference room.</p><p><br/>
Agatha had no right to hold Rio hostage in the situation she created herself, but she honestly couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>When the sun started to shy away behind the skyline, Agatha decided that it was probably time to leave the office.</p><p> </p><p>She grabs her coat and a few important folders before making her way out. As she walks past the empty desks from the workers smart enough to leave before 5:30 pm, she’s met by a familiar face. </p><p> </p><p>“Going home already?” Rio asks, taking a step in front of Agatha to hinder her from reaching the elevator. They’re standing way too close for Agatha’s liking, but she doesn’t make a move to back off. </p><p> </p><p>She rolls her eyes, “Vidal.” She says warningly.</p><p> </p><p>“Simple question.” Rio shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going home.” Agatha deadpans. </p><p> </p><p>Rio lights up, “Great, I’m just gonna grab my coat.”</p><p> </p><p>Once Rio has moved away from in front of her, Agatha does not care to wait for her to grab her coat. Something that was probably expected. </p><p> </p><p>She thought that would be indication enough that she did not care about having company on her way home, but apparently Rio doesn’t understand social cues because seconds later she hears her hurried steps from behind her.</p><p> </p><p>There’s so much about this situation that Agatha hates.</p><p> </p><p>She hates that she could recognise the sound of Rio’s uneven steps when the heels touch the floor. She hated even more that she could smell her, just from the proximity alone. A musky scent with a hint of roses - the same perfume Rio had worn when she walked into this office the first time three years ago, <em> and </em>the same scent Rio had carried this weekend that was still stuck in Agatha’s bedsheets. She should probably clean them when she gets home. </p><p> </p><p>But mostly she hated how she didn’t hate it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had a certain pull to her that was impossible to ignore. That pull is probably the sole reason Agatha is in this very situation. </p><p> </p><p>Before Saturday, they had always been friendly. Nothing like the cold callousness of today. </p><p> </p><p>Not like Agatha was ever out for friendships. But they stayed professional. </p><p> </p><p>Rio is, after all, one of the best detectives Agatha’s ever met - and she had deep respect for her colleague. Even if she could be so annoying Agatha wanted to rip her hair out at times. </p><p> </p><p>A few moments later, when they’re alone in the elevator, Rio breaks the silence, “What did I do?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs. “Thought it was obvious enough?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh don’t go giving me that Agatha. I’ve been acting professional all day, like you asked.” Rio gives her a snide eye. “If anything you’re the one who-”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha cuts her off abruptly, looking at Rio with the most intense anger she can muster. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, “All I’m saying is… You’ve been acting differently. Keep this shit up and they’re gonna figure it out eventually.”</p><p> </p><p>The elevator stops and because Agatha’s never been this eager to get out of anywhere before, she gets the lead, walking a few steps in front of Rio the entire way through the entrance lobby.  </p><p> </p><p>Once Rio’s caught up and they’re outside, with no one around to possibly hear them, Agatha speaks again, “They’re not gonna figure anything out because there’s <em> nothing </em>to figure out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Rio says before continuing with a satisfied smile. “<em> Nothing </em>is quite rich coming from you though.”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s that even supposed to mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“I seem to remember now, quite clearly, how you loved when-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha interrupts that sentence before it can even begin to plant its dangerous roots into the world. Then she stops, turning around and blocking Rio in the same way she’d done with Agatha upstairs. “Go have fun on your date Rio - hope the sex is better than <em> okay </em>this time.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she turns and walks away, not bothering to even listen to what sneering comeback Rio’d come up with.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Coming home she finally takes a second to breathe for what feels like the first time in hours.</p><p> </p><p>This day had been unusually exhausting, and Rio is partly to blame for that. It had to have been intentional: All of the knowing glances in Agatha’s way, the snide remark this morning and the way she wore her hair down today-- as if to serve as a reminder…</p><p> </p><p>…Agatha probably should reflect on why this affects her so much.</p><p> </p><p>She won’t.</p><p> </p><p>But if there’s one feeling she knows, it’s annoyance. Which is what she eventually results in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chooses to order takeaway since she can’t even be bothered to cook anything. After today that felt like a way too heavy chore for her to do. </p><p> </p><p>The driving urge to scream into a pillow at that second is overwhelming - but she decides not to. After all, she's almost a 50 year old woman, for christ sakes. She should be long past such childish behaviors. </p><p> </p><p>After a few seconds of furious searching, she finds the remote control buried in between the couch pillows and she turns on the tv.</p><p> </p><p>She’s found during later years that even the distant voices from the tv would keep her head preoccupied and stop the constant downward spiral of her thoughts that would occur at any minor inconvenience in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Her therapist once told her that’s destructive behavior. But since Agatha knew for a fact that the therapist herself never once lost her child, she decided to ignore the advice to ‘<em> stop </em>being afraid of her own thoughts.’ </p><p> </p><p>This would eventually become a trend in Agatha’s life.</p><p> </p><p>Not caring about the advice from anyone. Operating on her own playing field, both at work and at home. She knew it had probably become destructive - only a few old friends cared to stick around, and she only sees them once every other month.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky, her son, had been born from a donor, which further pushed Agatha’s loneliness - she had no one to grieve with.</p><p> </p><p>And twenty years later, she still finds herself grieving over a bottle of red wine every once in a while.</p><p> </p><p>Typically, this would be after a very arduous day - cases of missing children, mostly. But every once in a while she’d let herself just cry. Not in the presence of someone else, of course, she still had a facade to hold up.</p><p> </p><p>Today was one of those days.</p><p> </p><p>And so, later that night, when Agatha pours her first glass of wine to herself, she cries.</p><p> </p><p>The tears honestly feel like a relief at that moment. The taste of the red wine mixed with the salty taste of her own tears is disturbingly comforting. </p><p> </p><p>The glass is empty only one minute later.</p><p> </p><p>Refilling it again without a second thought, she then relaxes back into the couch and turns her attention towards the tv. </p><p> </p><p>A news programme was on, which didn’t help the overbearing sense of hopelessness-- but at least it wasn’t quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, like everything, the programme ended - followed by some stupid reality series. Agatha never bothered to keep up with those. Even if watching tv was a part of her daily schedule, lazy tv was not her thing and so she shuts the tv off in annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>By now, she was almost finished with the bottle, which prompted her to take a good look at her living room. </p><p> </p><p>She hated it, frankly.</p><p> </p><p>Not the furniture itself, it was comfortable and it looked okay in the aesthetic of her home, it served its purpose. But something felt incredibly off about the placement and the decorations covering the walls.</p><p> </p><p>A sudden urge to redecorate strikes her like lightning. She makes a quick plan in her head to move her dining table towards the windows so you can get a greater look at the view from her 11th story apartment. Then she decides it’s also high time to reorder some of the paintings on the wall behind the sofa. </p><p> </p><p>In hindsight, this would probably be considered a bad idea, even by her own standards. But right now, nothing feels more important. And so Agatha pours herself another glass of wine before standing up on wobbly feet and making her way over to the brown dining table in the middle of the room. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t realize until it was too late just how drunk she was. She never expected it to get this far. She’s at the point in which she can’t walk straight and bumps into one of the armchairs, ready to cuss it out for being in her way.</p><p> </p><p>After moving all the chairs and the table halfway to its final destination, she has to sit down again. Using wine as her chosen beverage of hydrating? Another stupid idea.</p><p> </p><p>The most embarrassing fact of them all is that the clock hadn’t even struck 8:30 pm, and she was already drunk out of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Back on the couch she sighs in defeat as she runs her eyes over the living room. Her dining chairs in a mess, spread out across the room and the table standing diagonally because she could only be bothered to move one end. </p><p> </p><p>The overpowering feeling of sadness and fatigue hits her again like a truck as she breaks down crying again. Head in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>She’s annoyed with herself, annoyed with the world, annoyed with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p><em> Oh </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, another bad idea, because apparently she’s full of them this week, hits her.</p><p> </p><p>A second later, before she has the chance to rethink her actions, the sound of the dial is heard as she places her phone to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>Almost immediately, the person on the other end picks up.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha says with a sob of relief. </p><p> </p><p>“You never call me that.” Rio is quick to pick up on, worry apparent in the way she carefully speaks “What’s wrong, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t stop another sob from escaping her throat. The feeling of agony too overbearing to push against.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re crying?” Rio asks in disbelief, but the same worry is still apparent.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods but then realizes that Rio can’t <em> see </em>her. By then it’s too late.</p><p> </p><p>Rio speaks again.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m coming over.” Rio says hurriedly and Agatha can hear a conversation taking place on the other end, but not loud enough to make up words.</p><p> </p><p>The realization hits her like a freight train. Rio is on a date right now. </p><p> </p><p>Amidst everything else she’d totally forgotten about that and guilt washes over her as Rio speaks again, loud and clear which could only mean that she’d already excused herself from the date, “What’s your address?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry I called, Rio, go back to your date.” Agatha says, hanging up before Rio can even answer her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels horrible. Not only did she call Rio and interrupt her date, but Rio had actually been ready to leave for her? </p><p> </p><p>Regret and anger, mostly at herself this time, piled up inside her, impossible to escape. She wanted to crawl underneath the earth to stay there forever. Hidden away from all the horrible truths that she has to face eventually.</p><p> </p><p>Rio would never let this go, and having to go to the office again the next morning felt like such a looming weight over her. Rio would never let her forget about this, the monday night Agatha called, drunk out of her mind at 8:30 pm, <em> crying </em> and interrupting Rio’s date.</p><p> </p><p>This was over the line. If Rio had done something like this Agatha would probably laugh, or tell Rio to get her shit together, and then hang up herself. It was ridiculous. It was childish. It was so far removed from everything Agatha believed herself to be.</p><p> </p><p>Moving her way across the wooden floor into her bedroom, she struggled to get her office clothes off to put on something more sleep appropriate.</p><p> </p><p>The buttons on her shirt put up a fight against Agatha's fingers, and she groaned - everything and everyone seemed against her today. </p><p> </p><p>With the shirt halfway off and her pants somewhere deserted on the bedroom floor she suddenly hears three hard knocks on her front door. </p><p> </p><p>She panics - she really can’t handle an angry neighbor complaining about the noise coming from her apartment - it wouldn’t be the first time, but still it was humiliating and very <em> very </em>annoying.</p><p> </p><p>Stopping in front of the front door she takes a few deep breaths to prepare herself before she flings the front door furiously, “What?!” She says, probably a bit too loudly, before her eyes can even focus on the person standing in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands there, speechless, with her hand still on the door. She can’t seem to catch up with her thoughts as they begin to speed up, not a single one even close enough to grasp.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Is all Agatha can seem to manage to say. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks confused for a second, “You called? Remember?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh<em> right </em>, Agatha had almost forgotten about that during her fight with the shirt. The shirt, which now she realizes, still hasn’t been replaced - leaving the top half of her chest and bra exposed.</p><p> </p><p>Ashamed, she turns around and walks into her bedroom closet to find something more appropriate to wear with company around. Leaving Rio by the front door. </p><p> </p><p>Apparently Rio had seen this as an invitation, because suddenly Agatha hears her voice from behind her as she tries to get the shirt off again.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha mumbles something incoherent not even she herself can figure out what she’d said.</p><p> </p><p>Moving about the room in a fit of rage she tries to find a comfortable replacement shirt. Rio just watches her from the door opening, leaning against the side of the white door frame. </p><p> </p><p>“You shouldn’t have left your date.” Agatha spits out after she finally gets another shirt on.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks. That goddamn smirk that Agatha wanted to get rid off so badly “You shouldn’t have changed your shirt.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, moving to make her way past Rio and into the kitchen to refill her wine glass again. This situation certainly called for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you really think you should drink that?” Rio asks, catching up and placing her hand over the wine glass to stop Agatha pouring it in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply scoffs, and in something alike a childish tantrum, she makes her way towards her glass cabinet to get another glass. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, what happened in here?” Rio asks, nodding towards the misplaced chair and table in the middle of the room.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m redecorating.” Agatha answers matter-of-factly, with a dismissive wave in Rio’s direction.</p><p> </p><p>Rio simply smiles at Agatha's antics “Right.”</p><p> </p><p>It pisses her off even more.</p><p> </p><p>“You shouldn't have come, I clearly hung up on you. And wait-” Agatha turns around, “I didn’t even tell you my address.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, “Wasn’t hard to find.” Then she pauses, looking at Agatha with a certain sincerity in her eyes, it puts Agatha on edge. “And you expected me to <em> not </em>? You called me crying, Agatha. What’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Rio walks over to her with a certain ambiguity in her step. Never letting Agatha out of her kind and caring gaze. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s just-” Agatha takes a deep breath to block the sob that threatened to escape any second. “My son.” She finally sighs - the sob impossible to stop this time as she feels her knees getting weak from beneath her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her surprised, “You have a son?”</p><p> </p><p>And <em> oh </em>, Agatha forgot she never told anyone about him.</p><p> </p><p>A few years after Nicky’s death, Agatha had decided that she should move. She needed an escape from all the haunting memories. Waking up in the same apartment that she’d shared with him had been too draining. Every day a reminder of what was, what isn’t and what could’ve been. </p><p> </p><p>When she moved to Boston, 10 years ago, she never told anyone about him. Never. It felt wrong to go talking about her trauma to people she’d just met - and she didn’t want her new team to feel sorry for her.</p><p> </p><p>7 years later Rio had joined her team. </p><p> </p><p>Of course she didn’t know about Nicky. No one did. Not around here anyway.</p><p> </p><p>People back in her home town knew, of course. Bringing her groceries for a few months when getting out of bed felt like too much work. </p><p> </p><p>When she finally did, and became what people call, a <em> workaholic </em> , everyone was too empathetic - which doesn’t sound bad. But for Agatha it was too much. People were too nosy, getting all up in her business. They simply cared <em> too much </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Had </em>.” She finally responds, sitting back down on the couch.</p><p> </p><p>The sudden realization hits Rio’s face, her smile being replaced by a heartbroken expression Agatha can not put her finger on. </p><p> </p><p>And there it is again, empathy - the careful concern that Agatha hated so much she needed to look away. Finding an escape in the dark night sky behind the skyline. </p><p> </p><p>“How long ago?” Rio asks while carefully placing her hand on Agatha’s back, rubbing it with slow and deliberate strokes.</p><p> </p><p>“Twenty years ago.” Agatha says, whispering, like she’s afraid of confronting the words. </p><p> </p><p>Still she doesn’t acknowledge Rio’s hand on her back, nor the fact that Rio had taken a place beside her on the soft couch, “I’m so sorry.” She says simply without once ceasing to caress Agatha’s back.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t.” Is all Agatha can say as her tears threaten to spill over once again as they rest on her waterline. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Feel sorry for me.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hoped that they would leave the conversation there, but Rio had other plans. Suddenly, the gentle strokes on her back were gone, attentively replaced by fingers on the lower side of her cheek, urging her to turn around.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio whispers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head. Mainly as an attempt to force Rio’s hand off her face, but also in a refusal. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, “Look at me.”</p><p> </p><p>But right now, that’s the last thing Agatha wants to do. She’d rather jump out of this window than look at Rio in the eyes after she just shared that with her. She felt vulnerable- <em> exposed </em>.</p><p> </p><p>But the fingers so gently caressing her cheek and jawline makes her crave more. She hated the compassion that simmered underneath the motives of the touch -- couldn’t it be just <em> want </em>. Agatha knew it wasn’t, but for a few seconds, she allowed herself to believe so.</p><p> </p><p>She turns around. </p><p> </p><p>Meeting Rio’s eyes for the first time since telling her about Nicky made her regret it immediately. The sorrow and the <em> care </em>visible within the dark colors of them. </p><p> </p><p>They sit like that for a few moments. The loud noises coming from the street down below cancel out along with Agatha’s racing thoughts. It’s like the world went quiet, everything being in total standstill - the only proof that the world was still moving being the slow breaths coming out from Rio’s mouth along with her chest falling and rising in tandem.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel the hot breath against her with the same presence as the fingers still against her jawline. </p><p> </p><p>Her lips part involuntarily before she slowly leans in. </p><p> </p><p>What prompts her to do so is unknown, even to herself. She’ll excuse it later and tell herself that it was the wine acting on behalf of her. But perhaps it was just the overwhelming craving of Rio’s lips against hers. She needed to feel them again - to feel the pressure of them. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio whispers breathlessly, a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t pull back, she can’t bring herself to. The kiss felt <em> so </em>right in that moment it was like an otherworldly gravity in the distance between their lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t kiss me unless you mean it.” Rio sighs, releasing Agatha from her touch and standing up. </p><p> </p><p>The immense distance created between them from those simple words was immeasurable. </p><p> </p><p><em> Unless you mean it </em>. Agatha mutters to herself angrily, how could Rio possibly know that she didn’t?</p><p> </p><p>Every step that Rio takes towards the kitchen feels like a sting in Agatha’s heart - causing her to once again place the indestructible walls around herself. </p><p> </p><p>Indestructible was an overstatement, of course. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had removed them with a single touch.</p><p> </p><p>Twice.</p><p> </p><p>It was something in the gentle nature of the touches, like a silent promise, a whisper that Rio won’t let her fall. Not alone.</p><p> </p><p>Except she just did. Fighting the urge to cry again, she straightens her back and stands up - her mind clear as day but her body still affected by the heavy amounts of wine in her system. She struggles to walk in a straight line to where Rio is, helping Agatha clean up in her kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>There’s almost something domestic in it - watching Rio place plates in the dishwasher before closing it and cleaning her hands - no distinctable hurry in the action.</p><p> </p><p>“You should go to sleep, Agatha.” Rio says while still washing her hands prolongedly. </p><p> </p><p>“Will you be here when I wake up?” Agatha asks, genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to?” Rio asks, turning around while drying her hands on the white kitchen towel.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes, preparing herself for the impact of her own words, “Yes.” It comes out as a whisper. It sounds more unsure than Agatha feels it to be.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s the wine talking,” Rio states, watching Agatha’s reaction closely from across the kitchen island. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha says, but she’s still not ready to let Rio go. She wanted to be stronger than this, she really did. But Rio had an incredible pull to her, it was impossible to fight. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio sighs after a few seconds. “I’ll stay, but I won't-"</p><p> </p><p>“Won’t what? Have sex again?” Agatha mocks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, “I thought we agreed that never happened.”</p><p> </p><p>“If it never happened I wouldn’t remember it this vividly would I?” Agatha asks. She regrets it a second later when she sees the surprise in Rio’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>It dies a second later.</p><p> </p><p>“Go to bed,” Rio demands, Agatha would think, solely based on tone, that Rio was mad. But the glint in her eyes and the smile threatening to escape exposes her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m older than you,” Agatha mumbles, because she was <em> oh so </em>aware of it.</p><p> </p><p>“See, that’s exactly why you need to sleep.” Rio taunts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her hands up in defeat and makes a beeline towards her bedroom, leaving Rio smiling by the kitchen sink for a few seconds before she decides to follow her.</p><p> </p><p>As Agatha undresses to go to bed, she can feel the lingering eyes of Rio from the doorway as she’s standing there, afraid to go in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew deep down, even in her drunken state, the reason Rio hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t fair that she’d been so dismissive to Rio the entire day at the office, only to call her only hours later and then asking her to stay the night. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em> knew </em>that. She also knew that she’ll probably behave the same way tomorrow, and the day after that. She couldn’t help it. </p><p> </p><p>Her attraction to Rio was, at this point, undeniable.</p><p> </p><p>Choosing to deny that thought entirely, Agatha goes to bed. Exhaustion mixed with the wine was enough to take her out almost the second her head hits the pillow. <br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The next day, Agatha wakes up by her alarm with a headache so strong she feels as if her temples are gonna hammer their way out of her head and leave her there on the bed forever.</p><p> </p><p>She feels Rio on the other side of the bed, just like she’d woken up just a few days ago - but this time she actually remembers last night.</p><p> </p><p>Once again, anxiety and regret washes over her. They didn’t do anything last night - Rio even stopped Agatha from kissing her. Now in hindsight, Agatha is thankful for that.</p><p> </p><p>She’d never been one to believe that drunk words are sober thoughts, but yesterday was definitely a testament to that theory.</p><p> </p><p>The things she’d told Rio last night she hadn’t told anyone in over 15 years, and for a good reason. </p><p> </p><p>Groaning, Agatha sits up and takes the Advil placed on her nightstand - Rio’s doing, most likely. </p><p> </p><p>Talking about Nicky… almost <em> kissing </em>Rio. It’s like this woman knew the exact ways to make Agatha crumble, how to strip away her layers, and just lay her bare. Literally and metaphorically. Agatha had a certain respect for it, because it was impressive in its nature. No one had been able to before. </p><p> </p><p>But mostly she loathed it. Rio had become a weakness - she couldn't have a weakness.</p><p> </p><p>Moving to stand up, she puts on some clothes while watching as Rio had slept through the alarm, laying in her bed peacefully.</p><p> </p><p>Now when she <em> could </em>control her thoughts, she chose to ignore the yet again warm and domestic feeling she got by seeing Rio comfortable in her home - just like yesterday by the dishwasher. </p><p> </p><p>She decides to make coffee before waking up Rio a few minutes later. </p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Agatha hands Rio the coffee, a barely audible “Thank you” before Agatha’s out of that room again, sitting down by the kitchen island in silence. Not for long because Rio joins her mere moments later.</p><p> </p><p>“Before you say anything - I promise I won't talk to the other’s about this.” Rio sighs, sounding almost defeated.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at Rio gently as silent appreciation. </p><p> </p><p>She studies her for a moment. There’s a tiredness and, behind that, a certain glint in Rio’s eyes - but if you peel away that first layer, there's something else entirely.</p><p> </p><p><em> Hurt </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks hurt-- <em> sad </em>even, behind everything else. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re needed at the office in 40 minutes.” Rio says indifferently before downing the rest of her coffee and standing up to grab her coat. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Agatha knows what Rio must’ve felt yesterday. The dismissive attitude coming from Rio felt so worryingly out of place.</p><p> </p><p>Brushing it off before she can think too much about it, Agatha also grabs her coat and joins Rio by the front door.</p><p> </p><p>The walk to the office is eerily quiet, mainly because Rio is <em> never </em>quiet. Agatha knew this, Rio knew this, everyone knew this. It puts Agatha on edge for the entire walk, not hearing the usual whistling or the humming that usually was the case around Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Choosing to ignore it, she walks with her head high and back straight, trying to breathe in as much fresh air as possible to wear off her hangover. </p><p> </p><p>It’s futile.</p><p> </p><p>When they enter the office twenty minutes later, the remnants of the wine last night are still very eminent, especially in her temples.</p><p> </p><p>Rio skips the coffee machine and heads right into the conference room for their morning meeting, the rest of the team yet to arrive. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha walks into the room a few minutes later and sits down by her place at the table. The uncomfortable silence between them ever since this morning is still noticeable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is looking through the green folder she always carries around, studying each page in silence. It once again puts Agatha on edge.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio! My favorite date-ditcher.” Jen says as she enters the room, Agatha scoffs. “How’d it go with your mom?” She then asks.</p><p> </p><p>Shrugging, Rio still doesn’t look up from her pages, “She’s fine now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we had a wonderful evening, you can join us next time instead - Angelica was very understanding, she won’t hold any grudges.”</p><p> </p><p>“Great,” Rio answers with a hint of sarcasm as she slams her folder shut, the action doesn’t escape Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, what’s up?” She asks as she sits down.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing I just-” Rio says before looking up, not at Jen but eyes piercing directly at Agatha this time. “I realized yesterday that I’m not really ready to jump into the dating pool.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches - the ambiguity of that answer not lost on her. She tries to remain indifferent, or even calm, at least on the outside. The inside of her, however, wants to scream. </p><p> </p><p>Instead she clears her throat, “Find any new information about the case since yesterday, Vidal?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, eyes filled with animosity, “No.” she says, her brown eyes burning their way into Agatha, “I was <em> preoccupied </em>last night.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a shame,” Agatha retorts.</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorts, “Thought you’d say that.”</p>

<p>Rio had been ignoring Agatha all day.</p><p> </p><p>She’d barely noticed it at first. Sure, she was acting out of the ordinary during their morning meeting - not asking annoying questions like she usually did, not chipping up at every minor opportunity to question Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Normally, this pissed Agatha off. What she wasn’t prepared for, however, was how she missed it.</p><p> </p><p>During the entire meeting something felt off. Every time she finished a statement, she looked at Rio to see if she’d add or ask anything - but she never seemed to. It was slowly making Agatha lose her mental footing as the meeting went on.</p><p> </p><p>Afterwards, she chose not to think about it. Excusing it in her mind to <em> a case of the Mondays.</em></p><p> </p><p>It was Tuesday.</p><p> </p><p>After the morning meeting, Agatha had gone into her office to speak on the phone with a detective from New Jersey, to see if there was any bit of information that had been lost in translation when the case was transmitted to her department instead.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had entered the office in the middle of the call and ,without saying a word, left two black folders on Agatha’s desk before walking out, without so much as an expression on her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t thought much about the exchange - <em> or lack thereof </em> - in the moment. But when she hung up the phone call and stretched over the table to pick up the folders, she realized how out of character Rio had been acting.</p><p> </p><p>They’d been working together on cases for three years now, which was enough for Agatha to know some of Rio’s habits. She knew that Rio was friendly but frightening at the same time, not afraid to show some teeth if needed. She also knew Rio never shied away from a conversation, and certainly wasn't one to care about interrupting a phone call.</p><p> </p><p>But most of all, Rio wore her feelings and thoughts in her expressions. One glimpse and one could find out exactly what Rio felt in that moment. In certain cases, it would help Agatha to know what Rio was feeling since they’d communicate over cases easier. But it could also piss her off, much like everything else, because sometimes she didn’t care about Rio’s opinions on a case. </p><p> </p><p>Shutting someone up was easy enough, but getting them to stop  with a certain facial expression was certainly harder.</p><p> </p><p>As lunchtime came around, Agatha had left her office to walk over to her colleagues as they sat conversing in the conference room while eating. </p><p> </p><p>Normally, Agatha wasn’t present during these lunch breaks, often resulting in eating in her own office while working. But today, it was like she was solving her own detective case, without her group.</p><p> </p><p>The reason behind Rio's animosity.</p><p> </p><p>First step in the investigation was finding out if Rio’s acting was solely towards Agatha, or if it affected the other people around her too.</p><p> </p><p>Soon enough Agatha discovered that it did only directly affect her. Rio wasn’t less talkative today than any other days - at least not to the others.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows.</p><p> </p><p>She genuinely didn’t know what she had done wrong. Had she said something last night that would justify Rio’s actions? Agatha played with the thought for a while. She thought back to the night before, trying to see if there were any moments she was unable to recall - only to find there were none.</p><p> </p><p>In an attempt to further investigate the situation, Agatha had gone to Rio’s desk in the afternoon.</p><p> </p><p>“I looked over those files, good work, Vidal.” She smiled as genuinely as she could muster, but it never really reached her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t take her attention off the computer screen as she slid the papers over the desk. “Thank you.” She’d said, still not looking up, barely even acknowledging that Agatha was standing there.</p><p> </p><p>With a feigned confidence, Agatha nodded sharply and turned on her heels to make a beeline towards her office. She’d closed the door, probably a bit too hard, before stomping over to her desk and sitting down, trying to distract herself with work. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t left since then. </p><p> </p><p>This had to have been the least productive day of Agatha’s entire career, she was sure of it. She had a few matters that she needed to discuss with Alice and Lilia, but she couldn’t gather the strength enough to leave the office.</p><p> </p><p>Which is where she was currently at. Still at her desk and rereading the same paper for the third time. There was important information in there, she was sure of it-- she just couldn’t seem to puzzle it together. </p><p> </p><p>She knew she needed Rio for this. </p><p> </p><p>Any other day, Agatha wouldn’t have hesitated to ask Rio to come into her office. But today, something in the air had shifted. From indifference to <em> indifference </em>? Agatha still couldn’t pinpoint the distinction.</p><p> </p><p>A minute later, she groans in defeat as she stands up - walking out to see if Rio was still in the office. She really needed her help with this-this <em> feud </em>Rio had started, for some reason, be damned.</p><p> </p><p>They needed to stay professional, and how could they if their mere situation hindered work from being done? </p><p> </p><p>The office had been nearly emptied out now as it was just a little bit after 5 pm. Agatha walks over to Rio, because to her relief, Rio was also something of a workaholic. Not in the same manner as Agatha, no one could be, but they’d often be the last ones standing. </p><p> </p><p>“Vidal,” Agatha says, trying to keep her professionalism, “I need your help with something.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up and behind the emptiness in her eyes, there’s a hint of something else, something lighter.</p><p> </p><p>“You need <em> my </em> help?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make me say it again,” Agatha says firmly before turning around, hoping Rio would understand and follow her back into her office.</p><p> </p><p>She did.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve read through this three times and I still can’t seem to put the puzzle pieces together. There’s something big hidden behind this, I <em> know </em>it.” Agatha says, handing the paper over to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, “Can we do this tomorrow?” She sounds exhausted. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up. “I guess,” She says, ripping the page furiously out of Rio’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>Nothing is said between them after that. Instead, they stand in silence. Dangerously close but none of them taking a step back.</p><p> </p><p>Until Rio does.</p><p> </p><p>Stepping back, she breaks eye contact, looking out over the sun lowering behind the horizon outside of the window instead. Agatha’s eyes are still fixed on Rio, not wavering. She can’t quite interpret what’s going on behind those eyes-- but it isn’t impossible to figure out that <em> something </em>is.</p><p> </p><p>She sighs, asking, “What did I do?” - still looking at Rio carefully to see if she could get an answer from facial expressions alone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs, face empty, “sounds a lot like what I asked you only 24 hours ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t piss me off.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not trying to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was ready to start pacing back and forth, not patient enough to handle this. “Tell me what’s going on, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, Rio snaps her eyes away from the skyline to meet Agatha’s. “<em> Rio </em>,” she mumbles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her confused - not understanding quite what’s going on but trying so desperately to. The once cold stone look on Rio’s face had softened a bit which, granted, was a huge relief. </p><p> </p><p>“You never call me Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>The look of confusion got even more apparent on Agatha’s face. She could’ve sworn this exact conversation happened on the phone the day before, “Did I not do that last night?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glares at her, “At the <em> office </em> , I mean.”<br/><br/></p><p>“Well I don’t really call anyone by their first name at the office…” Agatha trails off, her hands fiddling with the paper, “...old habit.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have such confusing double standards, you know?” Rio says with a sudden burst of anger that Agatha had not braced herself for. “First, you basically ignored me all of yesterday, only to call me <em> crying </em> and <em> begging </em> me to stay with you during the night. But when <em> I </em>do the same to you-”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Begging me to stay the night?” Agatha bites back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio furrows her brows, sneering, “<em> ignoring </em>you, all of a sudden you freak out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a step back, mentally and physically, “I’m not freaking out.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not?” </p><p> </p><p>If looks could kill, Agatha would be in a grave. There was something entirely new to the way Rio looked at her. Before, they’d had a lot of disagreements - granted. A few of them would make Agatha storm off in a fit, never Rio though. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t always calm, she wasn’t always nice. But she wasn’t as hot tempered as Agatha - she’d never actually stay angry like Agatha would. </p><p> </p><p>Ready to turn the tables, Agatha wants to hit Rio where it would hurt. “Do you know how many people in this office know about Nicky except you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>“No one, <em> no one </em>knows because I never tell anyone about him.”</p><p> </p><p>The hard look in Rio’s eyes falters - Agatha can even sense a bit of honest regret behind them. </p><p> </p><p>She’d won.</p><p> </p><p>Without a word, she grabs her coat to leave. Fury had piled up somewhere deep within her and the office walls felt like they were caving in. She needed to get out of there.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio blurts out, causing Agatha to stop in her tracks by the doorway, coat flung over her arm. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t look back at Rio, doesn’t dare to. The anger had piled up into tears, now threatening to escape. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment of silence, a single “I’m sorry,” leaves Rio’s mouth. The words are so heavy it feels as if they cling to the walls.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaves before Rio can stop her, unspoken words still heavy on her tongue. </p><p> </p><p align="center">______ </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>During the rest of the week, it was as if Agatha had made it her life's mission to not look Rio in the eyes. She was afraid to be confronted with either the same anger, emptiness, sorrow or hurt that had been visible in Rio’s eyes that day.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like Friday came with the wind.</p><p> </p><p>The days between then and now had blurred together in Agatha’s mind. With the vast amounts of work she’d put on herself that week, she wasn’t even sure if she ever left the office - or if the office ever left her. Those lines had blurred as well.  </p><p> </p><p>Friday afternoon, they finally solved the Maximoff case. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda was tied to an organization called the Wundagores and after her suicide, they’d moved the body all the way down to New Jersey to keep the trace off of them. </p><p> </p><p>It nearly worked. <em> Nearly </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been ready to go home, ready for an early evening when Jen knocked on her office door and announced that she’d bought a bottle of wine for the occasion. Not able to say no, Agatha stood up to join the celebration. </p><p> </p><p>The entire team was now in the conference room talking over a shared bottle of wine - everyone except Billy, that is. He wasn’t a drinker but he joined them anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha writhes in her seat, toying with the stem of her wine glass. She didn’t have a problem with drinking. Hell - she even enjoyed it a lot - but she hadn’t willingly spent time close to Rio since Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p>She could feel Rio’s eyes on her like a weight pushing her down. She wants to squirm out of it.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia was complaining about the conference held earlier about the case, annoyed that the team didn’t get the credit they deserved for solving the case. </p><p> </p><p>To Agatha, this was old news. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t even count on one hand the amount of time she’d been handed a difficult case because no one else had figured it out. Only to solve it a week or two later and then not getting credit for it.</p><p> </p><p>It was annoying, sure. But she knew that complaining about it, whether that be to her colleagues or the police officers, wouldn’t help either - she’d tried a few years ago.</p><p> </p><p>All she could do now was smile at Lilias antics, nodding along but not doing anything to egg her on. </p><p> </p><p>“So, does anyone have any plans for the weekend?” Jen asks in between slow sips of wine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head - her sole plan being to binge watch some new series and drink a lot of wine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio answers, “I’m going on another date with Angelica,” and <em> oh </em>, Agatha raises her brows. </p><p> </p><p>She had not expected that at all. Hiding the frown behind a big sip of wine.</p><p> </p><p>Jen seems equally surprised, “thought you weren’t ready to date?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I never gave her a chance earlier. Thought I owed it to her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha distracts herself by swirling the wine around, studying the way it hits the side of the glass.</p><p> </p><p>This entire conversation confused her so much it was starting to become frustrating - well, it had been for a while now. She thought she was good at reading people's signals, but apparently she’d been completely off with Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Thinking about it made her sick. Not Rio going on another date with Angela, or whatever, but the mere reason Rio had left their date this Monday.</p><p> </p><p><em> Her </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, the rest of us could take this after-work to a bar instead,” Jen suggests, “I know one.”</p><p> </p><p>No one else seems opposed to the idea except Agatha, declining the invite and promptly standing up before the others can try to change her mind. She was a workaholic, sure, but spending more time than needed with her colleagues wasn’t top priority for her, never had been either. </p><p> </p><p>She knew deep down she needed to disprove the stereotypes of detectives with depressing home-lifes . But could she when she <em> was </em>the stereotype? </p><p> </p><p>Going to the bar with the other’s would probably save her some pretty annoying glances next week. But then again, why should she care? The last thing she needed was another stupid night out leading to bad decisions, or her drunk mind just carelessly confessing stuff. </p><p> </p><p><em> They’d have a better time without her anyway </em> - the bitter thought slips through the barriers of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Thinking it’s the wine's fault, she pushes the thought away with a dramatic shake of her head.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Later that evening, as Agatha was sitting on her couch beneath a blanket, with a wine glass in hand, and finished take-away on the table, she observed herself from an outside perspective for a second.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, even to herself, this was a sad scene. A middle aged woman, no friends, no family, home on a friday night drinking-- alone. </p><p> </p><p>She knew that, for once, this was her own choice - but that didn’t make it any easier. At the thought, it frankly became even more depressing. </p><p> </p><p>A second later, she’s in the shower. </p><p> </p><p>She had been real with herself and with the team back at the office, she really didn’t feel like going out. Especially today and especially after this week. But the group was supposed to meet outside of the bar in just 30 minutes, and Agatha no longer had it in her to be left alone in her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>Character development, if you will.</p><p> </p><p>Putting on something suitable for a bar, but still reputable enough to meet her colleagues in, she’s soon out the door.</p><p> </p><p>The bar isn’t far from the location of her apartment, only a slight 15 minute walk. Feeling the breeze of autumn was refreshing enough and she sobered up a bit from all the wine glasses she’d already consumed that night. </p><p> </p><p>She could hear her heels hit the concrete as she walked with pep in her step the entire way. Each block she passed filled her with newfound confidence. She wasn’t excited to go out with her team, but she wasn’t as opposed to the idea anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wouldn’t be there which was a relief in itself. If she was, Agatha wouldn’t have changed her mind about this - she knew that for sure.</p><p> </p><p>She had no feelings towards Rio except resentment for the way she treated her this Tuesday. Agatha found it unbelievable how Rio even dared to act so cold and closed off the day after she had told her about Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>And then she couldn’t even have the dignity to stay mad - she had to say <em> sorry </em>? Rio had always been a hazard. She was too good at work, and they would constantly argue about how to best go about a case. She was too good at arguing. Too good at solving cases. Too good at being annoying. She was too good in-</p><p> </p><p>She stops herself there before her mind can trail any further. She was already tip-toeing at the edge of what could be a disaster:</p><p> </p><p>Thinking about that night.</p><p> </p><p>She hated how she remembered. It was all clear in her mind, she didn’t have any black-outs that night, but she hated how the night had turned into a memory, almost wishing for it sometimes to go away so she’d forget it. But it was futile because the memory was there, somewhere far, <em> far </em>down in her unconscious at all times. As if it had been etched in her brain forever like some kind of curse. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, she reached the bar. </p><p> </p><p>Without being asked to show ID, which she was slightly offended about, she walked inside and looked around to find the others. </p><p> </p><p>She’d decided not to text them to announce her change of heart. In hindsight, when she’s standing by the entrance looking around with them nowhere to be found, she figures that was probably a bad idea. It’s not like they would text her to tell her <em> their </em>change of plans.</p><p> </p><p>But then she sees Alice at the bar ordering, and so Agatha approaches her before she could change her mind again. </p><p> </p><p>Alice, to Agatha’s surprise, lightens up when she sees her, “Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feigns a smile, “Gulliver.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not at the office. Call me Alice and I’ll buy you a tequila along with the others’.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, “you can’t do that anyway?”</p><p> </p><p>“The others are over there if you want to join them.” Alice says, pointing behind Agatha to a corner booth by the back of the bar.</p><p> </p><p>Nodding, Agatha turns around and walks towards them with the same straightened back and head high she usually uses in the office, not quite ready to let her guard down amongst her colleagues.</p><p> </p><p><em> Well- </em>. </p><p> </p><p>No. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t recall a time she’d seen either of them outside of their office clothes. Seeing them in this setting was humanizing, but confusing, somehow. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Jen exclaims when she sees her, making the others turn their heads.</p><p> </p><p>Smiling awkwardly, Agatha decides to take a seat beside Lilia, hoping she would be the most grounding character in this moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Could’ve chosen an easier booth to find…” Agatha mumbles. ”Did you have to corner booth it?” </p><p> </p><p>“We were hoping the music wasn’t as loud back here.” Billy explains and Agatha fights the urge to roll her eyes. That had really become her staple move these last few days.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, Agatha, Alice is buying drinks right now if you want one.” Jen offers.</p><p> </p><p>“I met her over at the bar already.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, well-”</p><p> </p><p>Jen is interrupted by Alice arriving back at their table, sitting down beside Billy and placing four tequila shots on the table. Agatha regrets accepting the offer immediately. She knew herself well enough to know that she was a messy drunk on wine, and even worse on tequila.</p><p> </p><p>Last time she was drunk on tequila was a few years ago. One of her childhood friends, whom she no longer had any contact with, had come to Boston and they’d gone out. By flirting they’d granted themselves at least four tequila shots, amongst all else.</p><p> </p><p>The morning after she’d woken up with a stranger in her bed - she believed her name to be Natalia? <em> No </em> . Nadja? <em> No </em> . Natasha? <em> Hmm </em>. </p><p> </p><p>As Alice says something about it ‘being sad that Rio couldn’t join us’, Agatha downs the shot in one swing.</p><p> </p><p>The next round, thankfully, Jen buys them all a glass of white wine instead. </p><p> </p><p>Although Agatha never liked it as much as she liked red, right now she was about happy to drink anything After all, she’d survived this week, solved a case <em> and </em> she was out socializing. All of the above were very big steps in the right direction, she believed.</p><p> </p><p>She tried her best at keeping up with the conversation around her, but not enough to actually care to speak up. Resting her back against the couch, she simply watched the other’s talk-- content in her situation.</p><p> </p><p>That is until Jen receives a text message. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio is around the block with her date.” </p><p> </p><p>Billy looks at Jen, “Ask her to join us?”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Agatha sits up abruptly from her comfortable position against the couch, “is that really necessary?” And then when everyone gives her a confused look she backtracks “I mean… she might be having a great date, leave them to it, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, Jen had not listened to her advice because ten minutes later Agatha sees Rio walk in with her date around her arm - <em> so it must’ve gone great </em>she thinks bitterly to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and her date - <em> Angela </em>? No. - walk over to them.</p><p> </p><p>“Angelica,” the blonde woman reaches out her hand for Agatha to shake. </p><p> </p><p>She reciprocates the handshake unwillingly and unnecessarily harshly, “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Angelica sit down on either side of the booth, Angelica, which apparently was her name, sits down beside Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>It makes Agatha squirm, not wanting to actually have to be near the woman. She was undeniably beautiful, which didn’t help the quiet resentment she already felt towards the woman. Big, blue eyes with blonde hair falling perfectly below her shoulders and a septum piercing that just seemed to belong on her face. </p><p> </p><p>And the way Rio looked too. Hair down and messy as her curls reached her collarbones. Along with the way the top buttons of her shirt were undone, it was as if Rio was walking in here <em> wanting </em> to provoke Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>She sits back again, hands crossed over her chest, trying not to look like she’s sulking but probably failing miserably. </p><p> </p><p>No one noticed, so Agatha believed her behavior to be safe in this scenario, and sunk even further back into the couch.  </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, a weight was placed on her and she couldn’t blame it on anything else than Rio’s eyes, observing, or even analyzing her. She felt hot underneath the pressure of them. Trying to ignore it, she shifted her focus to Jen as she was speaking.  </p><p> </p><p><em> Futile </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Soon enough Lilia, Alice and Billy started asking get-to-know questions to Angelica. It was a fun little game, even for Agatha as she was watching as an outsider.</p><p> </p><p>She found out a few interesting things about Rio’s date. </p><p> </p><p>Apparently, she’d lived her entire life in Boston-- boring.</p><p> </p><p>She worked as a skincare professional-- boring.</p><p> </p><p>And, she loved to read and play football-- Agatha actually needed to stop herself from laughing out loud at the last one. </p><p> </p><p>Angelica had to be the most bland woman Agatha had ever talked to. The thought of this being one of Jen’s best friends wasn’t unthinkable at all However, the thought of Rio having to sit through an entire date with this woman was unbelievable. She almost felt bad for her.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t really though. Because, after all, Rio had decided herself to go on date with this woman. Agatha had no say in the matter, even if she already loathed the woman with every fiber of her being.</p><p> </p><p>Alice then asks a question about her future plans, which Angelica answers with a wide smile on her lips and her <em> oh so </em>annoying voice - it sounds like a fork on a plate, “Well, I’m only 34 so I don’t really know what I want to do yet. I’m planning to start writing a mental health book, or something more fictional - I'm not sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help but snort at that answer. This was all ridiculous. </p><p> </p><p>The action provokes a glare from Rio, as if to say <em> ‘be nice’ </em>.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time in days, Agatha looks back at Rio, their eyes meeting. </p><p> </p><p>Not the one to shy away from a challenge, Agatha doesn’t break eye contact. So for the next minute or so, the conversation around them keeps flowing, but Agatha is stuck in their own world. Just her and Rio and the intense gaze she’s put under.</p><p> </p><p>It doesn’t feel as heavy when she can meet them and figure out the intent behind them. </p><p> </p><p>Even though Rio is still a hard read, just like earlier this week, there’s some challenge behind those eyes. But the emotion is unreadable. Agatha could explain it as fury, but that wouldn’t be quite correct-- even irritation, maybe, or annoyance doesn’t sound right.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is the first one to look away, and to Agatha’s dismay she’s looking at Angelica with a smile. </p><p> </p><p>But after a second or so of confusion, Agatha realizes the truth behind that expression. Agatha knew what Rio’s smile looked like, she’d been around the woman almost every week for three years now, and this was not it. </p><p> </p><p>The smile never quite reached her eyes, and there was something uncontent behind the entire expression. She looked unhappy.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Rio was a better liar than Agatha believed her to be, because Angelica’s smile back is genuine as she reaches her hand over the table to stroke Rio’s forearm. </p><p> </p><p>An untrained eye wouldn’t have noticed it, or for someone less observant than Agatha, the flinch Rio did at the touch would definitely go under someone’s radar. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha furrows her brows in confusion. Did Rio not like this girl? Why would she pretend to?</p><p> </p><p>“So, Angelica, ever kissed someone on a first date?” Alice asks, because apparently they’d all collectively moved on to this subject while Agatha was mentally absent.</p><p> </p><p>Angelica answers quite plainly, “yes?”  </p><p> </p><p>Jen smirks, “Ever slept with someone on a first date?” </p><p> </p><p>The question leaves Agatha in sheer disbelief for a second. Not that there was anything wrong with sleeping with people on a first date, but didn’t Jen at least have a bit of decorum? </p><p> </p><p>Angelica turns and looks at Rio with a smirk equally unsettling as the one from Jen, “not yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up abruptly, grabbing her coat. She needed to get the fuck out of there before she was gonna throw up. Not even explaining herself before she pushes past Angelica to get out of the booth, she turns around to excuse herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I need fresh air,” was all she said before she turned on her heel and made a beeline towards the entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, she breathes in the cold late October air. Letting it consume her for a second before breathing out trying to calm herself.</p><p> </p><p>She felt sick to her stomach, but blamed it in her mind on the alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe two tequila shots and four glasses of wine certainly wasn’t the best choice she’s ever made. But then again, this last week has been full of laughable choices. </p><p> </p><p>Pulling out a pack of cigarettes, she quickly lit one with shaking hands. Letting the warmth of the smoke enter her lungs before she breathed out slowly. </p><p> </p><p>She had never been much of a smoker - at least not outside of college. When Nicky was born she’d stopped completely, and when he died she’d picked it up again. Nowadays, lighting a cigarette is a rare occasion - much reserved for stressful situations or when she’s drunk. </p><p> </p><p>Both applied to this situation.</p><p> </p><p>And so, as the cigarette was almost halfway done, she let it slowly calm her down, grounding herself in the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Oh no. </em> She quickly throws the end of the cigarette on the ground, crushing it with the sole of her shoe before straightening her back, no need to turn around - she knew exactly who that voice belonged to.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t stop on my account.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, looking down at the crushed cigarette butt before turning around, “I’m going inside.”</p><p> </p><p>“So much for fresh air,” Rio taunts, placing herself in front of her to block her from going anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Out of spite, Agatha furiously brings another cigarette to her lips and lights it.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, what the fuck is your problem now, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, not wanting to entertain this conversation right now. </p><p> </p><p>“At least I'm trying here.” Rio mutters.</p><p> </p><p>“You want to know my problem?” Agatha says angrily, taking a deep drag to calm herself again.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re my problem right now, Rio. You’re in my way when I want to go inside. You were exasperating on Monday, and then you ignored me Tuesday after I told you about Nicky. I was scared you’d be <em> too </em> empathetic but I didn’t think you’d fail to be <em> at all </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to stop herself from rambling, but it’s all coming out uncontrollably. “Then you dare to show up here when I’ve clearly been avoiding you all week purposefully, with a goddamn date! We slept together for less than a week ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“So I’m not allowed to move on from a one night stand I thought we both agreed <em> did not happen </em>?” Rio snaps. </p><p> </p><p>‘Finally’, Agatha thinks.</p><p> </p><p>“And also, I remember you quite clearly saying that you weren’t gonna join the others tonight? I didn’t think you’d have such a problem with me bringing a date!”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have a problem with it!”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t?” Rio asks in disbelief. “Then explain to me why in hell you’ve been glaring at her and scoffing at her the entire night? And you’re <em> smoking </em> for fucks sake. I’ve never seen you smoke in my entire time knowing you.”<br/><br/></p><p>Agatha takes a step back, nostrils flaring. “I’ve been glaring and scoffing at your date because she is ridiculous - why did you even bring her? You obviously don't like her.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes I do,” Rio defends.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply scoffs again, “Yeah, right.”</p><p> </p><p>“See, that scoff you just did right there. That’s the problem, Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>“My scoff?” Agatha mocks.</p><p> </p><p>“-your attitude.” Rio glares at her for a second for interrupting. “You think the world owes you something, that you're better than everyone else. You have yourself on such a high pedestal - which is why we’re in this situation in the first place.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises her eyebrows, “I thought that was us sleeping together- was it not?”<br/><br/></p><p>“Yes, it was. But you’re so scared of what everyone will think if they found out. And you and I both know none of them would even care!”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe they wouldn’t, but how can I preserve my dignity knowing what I did?” </p><p> </p><p>“Is having sex <em> that </em> damaging to your image?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, but having it with <em> you </em>is.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio takes a step back. The anger in her eyes dismantled, revealing only hurt. Agatha wants to rephrase, to take it all back, but it’s too late. The damage was done. She takes another drag of her cigarette, not once breaking eye contact with Rio. Hoping she could somehow convey the regret she feels through eyes alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha throws the cigarette on the ground and takes a step forward. Feeling the unsteady rise and fall of her own chest as she tries to calm down. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at Agatha, “Was it not up to your standards or something?”</p><p> </p><p>Confused, Agatha is dragged out of her haze, “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you can’t even talk about it when it’s just us two, the only time you’ve mentioned it this week is when you were drunk out of your mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t out of my-”</p><p> </p><p>“You begged me to stay the night.” Rio deadpans. </p><p> </p><p>“And I couldn’t have done that sober?” Agatha asks sarcastically, earning a glare from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going inside.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, loving the thrill of the argument. “Back to your lovely date I assume?” She taunts.</p><p> </p><p>“You bet.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hope you have a wonderful time,” Agatha retorts sarcastically.</p><p> </p><p>“I will, and maybe I’ll fuck her, too!”</p><p> </p><p>A sudden chill runs down Agatha’s spine with enough force to make her grab Rio by the wrist as she turns to walk back into the bar. The touch is so heated it almost causes her to let go in shock. All her piled up anger is placed on the grip on Rio’s hand, impossible to let go off.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around, ready to cuss Agatha out.</p><p> </p><p>Like a gravitational pull, Agatha finds herself drawing in closer as Rio turns. It felt like nature's law to kiss her at that moment, nothing could’ve stopped it. No force could be stronger than gravity. No anger more heated than the one just exchanged in that argument.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth clashes against hers. It takes a second for them both to get accustomed to it, their mouths moving in tandem again. Even if they’d only done it once, it felt like going back to old habits, it felt <em> so right </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha furiously grips at the roots of Rio’s hair, pressing their mouths closer together. She feels Rio’s arms close around her neck, which is confirmation enough that Rio was on board with the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>With this newfound confidence in her actions, she lightly slips her tongue out to brush against Rio’s lower lip, earling a slight whimper. With nothing but pure animal instinct driving her, she uses the opportunity to press her tongue into Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Her tongue brushes past Rio’s teeth as she lets herself consume the entire feeling of Rio against her.</p><p> </p><p> Chest against chest, mouth against mouth, tongue against tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Moving against each other forcefully, Agatha decides to take her other hand and place it on Rio’s back, wanting no distance between them. She presses Rio even more forward. </p><p> </p><p>She could feel their chests moving rhythmically, breathing heavily against each other but none of them wanting to let go of the other.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slips her tongue into Agatha’s mouth and the lines between who’s who blur together into something else entirely - something <em> right </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licks the roof of Rio’s mouth, earling a low groan, which further encourages her. She once again uses her grip in Rio’s hair to pull them even closer together. Tongues clashing against each other furiously. </p><p> </p><p>With a deep breath Rio pulls away, taking a step back, her chest heaving as she’s trying to catch her breath. </p><p> </p><p>The kiss was still lingering on Agatha’s lips - the taste of Rio still on the tip of her tongue. Her body empty and aching to be touched again, she could feel the ghost of Rio’s arms around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips were swollen and red, her hair a tangled mess from all the twists and tugs. </p><p> </p><p>They both looked rough-- disheveled. </p><p> </p><p>Quietly, Agatha thanked herself for choosing to smoke behind a corner so she wasn’t visible from the windows of the bar - otherwise, her team would’ve gotten a show unlike anything else. </p><p> </p><p>She cups Rio’s face with an unbeknownst tenderness, stroking her cheek with her thumb. Eyes flickering between Rio’s lips and eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Ready to close the distance between them again, she’s interrupted.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispers warningly, placing a hand on Agatha’s arm as if to physically hold her off.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe <em> not </em>in an alleyway?” Rio says, looking around them pointedly. </p><p> </p><p>They weren’t in an alley, precisely, but the side street was empty except for a few parked cars along the curbstone. It wasn’t the most charming or colorful place to reconcile - nor was it a great place for a heavy make out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, “where then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your place?”</p>

<p>Rio goes back into the bar to grab her bag left by their table. Agatha waits outside impatiently; not only did she want to get home as soon as possible, with Rio, but it was also starting to get legitimately cold. She felt the frosty late October winds nipping the tip of her fingers and her nose. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio exits the bar and walks over to Agatha.  </p><p> </p><p>“What did you tell them?” Agatha asks nervously when she could feel Rio’s presence looming by her side, nodding back to the bar.</p><p> </p><p>“Told them you’d already gone home and I’m getting tired.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “Stupid excuse.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hits her lightly in the arm, “It was the first one I could think of.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh they’re gonna find out, aren’t they?” Agatha sighs. At the revelation, she was ready to turn around and walk away - still worried to face the inevitable consequences of her actions tonight.</p><p> </p><p>But then a featherlight, but calming, hand strokes her arm carefully. She exhales slowly, deliberating the positive and negative outcomes. “They won’t.” Rio says, assuringly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha decides to believe her. </p><p> </p><p>It was a relief, having trust in someone else. Even if she, deep down, clung to her own doubt - she let Rio’s confidence in the matter overtake her.</p><p> </p><p>“How can you be so sure?” Agatha asks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, “I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha can consider what that statement means, the Uber pulls up in front of them. </p><p> </p><p>They both get into the back of the car - tension fills the space immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, it hadn’t been as obvious, the entire world brought enough distance between to leave it undiscovered. But inside the car, it clung to the walls, laid thick in the air between them.</p><p> </p><p><em> Anticipation </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, so desperately, wants to look out the window - to bring the world outside closer - as an escape from the constant pull she felt towards Rio.</p><p> </p><p>However, Rio wasn’t only a force of gravity physically, she apparently also had the power to shift Agatha’s attention. Because she can’t look out the window, can’t bring herself to - not when Rio is <em> right there </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat in a relaxed manner Agatha couldn’t even think of displaying herself - looking out as the other cars passed by. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t fair, according to Agatha, that Rio could be so calm and collected in this scenario when she felt like every nerve within her was burning. Her body craved Rio in a way her mind never seemed to, which was the horrifying part.</p><p> </p><p>Her brain lost all its autonomy the moment they were in proximity with each other. Every feeling, every desire and every action controlled by her body. The perfect example of all three had just happened.</p><p> </p><p>Anger caused the argument. She wasn’t angry with Rio because she brought a date-- but her body was.</p><p> </p><p>She had no desire to kiss Rio outside of a bar-- but her body did.</p><p> </p><p>And she certainly didn’t think when her body suddenly pulled Rio against her. Kissing her. Holding her. Tasting her.</p><p> </p><p>Her brain had begun to catch up, but couldn’t seem to regret it. For once, her body and mind were aligned about Rio - she felt <em> right </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“So…” Agatha smirks, “you’ve ditched Angela for me two times now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, looking over at Agatha, “Angelica.” She corrects.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s what I said.”</p><p><br/>Rio scoffs, but still with a visible grin on her lips, “You’re hot when you're jealous.” <br/><br/></p><p>And those words throw Agatha off in multiple ways simultaneously. </p><p> </p><p>Rio so openly and carelessly flirting was a new development Agatha had not seen coming, it made her skin warm and a blush creep up behind her neckline.</p><p> </p><p>Also, she hadn’t been <em> jealous </em> per se - maybe annoyed, but mostly at Angelica and the others. She didn’t care if Rio went on a date, she’d even be happy to help her find someone. But <em> Angelica </em>? An abomination.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t jealous?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifts her eyebrows tauntingly, “Sure you weren’t. You simply walked away furiously when she even hinted at sleeping with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, “<em> Please </em>tell me you don’t like her.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? So I can like you instead?” Rio retorts. It comes out harsher than intended.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare, “<em> No </em>. Because she’s a bland person with uninteresting hobbies. She’s beautiful, yes - but you could find more personality in a carrot - I can believe why Kale likes her, they go well together, but you?” She pauses for a second before adding: “Not to mention, she’s even younger than you.”  </p><p> </p><p>Rio lifts her eyebrows, “And?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to take it all back. Hearing herself say all that stuff out loud, it did sound an awful lot like jeal-.</p><p> </p><p><em> No </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, “I just didn’t think younger women were your type.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really? What’s my type then?” Rio taunts, coming off as dangerously flirtatious. </p><p> </p><p>A faint blush appears on Agatha’s face, barely visible in the darkness of the car.</p><p> </p><p>“You tell me.” Agatha counters, deciding to keep up with Rio’s pace. Though it doesn’t come off as self-assured she’d hoped for - almost a bit breathlessly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio seems thrown off, though, much to Agatha’s pleasure - but without missing another beat, she smirks, “Guess you’ll just have to figure it out.”</p><p> </p><p>It feels like a constant tug-a-war. A challenge. A competition. </p><p> </p><p>Who will make the other one speechless first?</p><p> </p><p>The game was intriguing - the tension suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was never one to back down from a challenge, and she was a sore loser. So without missing a beat, she places her left hand on Rio’s thigh. Gentle, barely there at first. But she starts moving up slowly, never once breaking eye contact, “Oh I’m sure I will.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitches as she closes her eyes, stretching her neck and looking up at the ceiling with a deep breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha won.</p><p> </p><p>But she doesn’t remove her hand. Wanting to see exactly how Rio would react to her touch, she reaches even further up, her palm resting on the upper middle of Rio’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Her intoxicated brain had cleared up. All of her senses were on high alert. </p><p> </p><p>She could see every twist and turn in Rio’s face muscles, hear her uneven breathing, smell her proximity and feel every squirm beneath her touch. Taste-</p><p> </p><p><em> Well </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Every second passed in silence felt like a torture - the anticipation still unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lost track of time, because when the uber stops outside the entrance of her apartment building, she couldn’t with confidence tell if they sat in that car for one minute or three hours. </p><p> </p><p>Evidently, she knew that the distance between her apartment and the bar was approximately twenty minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Walking inside, Agatha has to purposefully keep her hands to herself, unless they were gonna make out in the middle of the street-- <em> again. </em></p><p> </p><p>She fidgets nervously with her hands against the silver handle on the way up in the elevator, ignoring Rio with the best of her ability.</p><p> </p><p>But once again, Rio was a force stronger than gravity. Agatha watches her carefully as she’s looking up at the ceiling, breathing heavily. </p><p> </p><p>The elevator stops and Agatha is out and unlocking her door in less than a heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d show you around, but you’ve been here already.” Agatha says, trying to lift the tension between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, taking off her coat and hanging it up in an excessively slow manner, “Twice.”</p><p> </p><p>“Third time’s the charm, right?” Agatha asks, breathlessly, closing the distance between them.</p><p> </p><p>She’s interrupted by a hand on her chest, holding her back.</p><p> </p><p>Vision blurry, Agatha looks at Rio confused. <em> ‘What now? </em>’ she thinks to herself, annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>“I need a glass of water,” Rio says, leaving Agatha in a haze by the front door as she makes her way towards the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to shake herself out of it - not sure, at this point, if Rio <em> liked </em>leaving her hanging.</p><p> </p><p>She stomps after Rio into the kitchen. Annoyed, she places her forearms against the cold surface of the kitchen island, simply watching as Rio grabs a glass from a cabinet and fills it with water. </p><p> </p><p>She brings it to her lips, never breaking eye contact, downing it in one go. When she turns to refill it, Agatha promptly stands up straight and walks over to the kitchen sink.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, teasingly, she places her hands on Rio’s hips, guiding her to turn around. </p><p> </p><p>Rio moans softly at the touch, making Agatha feel her entire body alight once again. Abandoning the glass in the sink, Rio finally accepts the subtle demand, turning around.</p><p> </p><p>For a few seconds they look at each other intensely, pure longing and lust fills the thick air between them. </p><p> </p><p>It’s making Agatha impatient, she didn’t know what game Rio was playing, but she wasn’t keeping up-- now she needed the upper hand again. </p><p> </p><p>She leans, whispering, “Don’t make me wait.” </p><p> </p><p>Her breath hits Rio’s ear with an intense warmth. A chill runs down Rio’s spine, knees wobbling and breath hitching as she watches Agatha closely - awaiting her next move. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who still had her hands on Rio’s hips, started to move them upwards with languid strokes. </p><p> </p><p>She examines Rio-- the squirm in her face muscles, every breath hitching and she notices Rio's lips part, ever so slightly, and how her breaths started to become heavier.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached the bottom of the shirt, carefully dragging her hands underneath. Her cold hands make Rio shiver and Agatha smirks, keeping her hands right below the ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio licks her lips, which catches Agatha’s attention as she glances down at them. The memory of mere 30 minutes earlier on the street is overwhelming, addicting, and entirely consuming.</p><p> </p><p>She leans in, letting their noses touch and she closes her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Rio’s lips are on hers. The kiss is gentle- nothing like earlier. </p><p> </p><p>It almost gives her a whiplash before she leans into it, slowly dragging Rio forwards by her hands, lips still interlocked. </p><p> </p><p>Feeling Rio’s arms around her neck once again is enough confirmation she needs. She reaches out, licking tauntingly on Rio’s lower lip. </p><p> </p><p>She opens her mouth lightly, and Agatha uses that opportunity to gently enter her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Her entire body feels on fire, and once again impatience is driving her crazy-- practically dragging Rio by the waist into the bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>It’s a miracle they didn’t break anything or hit a wall, because only seconds later, Agatha is above Rio on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>She roams her hands attentively over Rio’s upper half, trying to memorize every curve. </p><p> </p><p>Rio has a steady grip in the roots of Agatha’s hair, every pull and twist earning a slight whimper silenced by the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls away, breathing heavily, and sits up straddling Rio. She starts frantically unbuttoning Rio’s shirt, not caring if a button pops because right now she needs to see Rio, entirely-- <em> again </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits up to enable Agatha to pull off her shirt. Their chests pressing to each other, and for a second Agatha wants to keep Rio there, against her. But a new idea sparks her mind and she, maybe a bit too violently, presses Rio down back on the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans forward without missing a heartbeat and starts kissing slowly down the middle of her upper chest, right by the collar bones. </p><p> </p><p>Careful not to leave a mark, she moves her lips downwards while playing with the edge of her bra with her hand. She reaches back, and with skillful hands she opens the buckles and slowly drags it off.</p><p> </p><p>She takes a nipple into her mouth, caressing it slowly with her tongue. She flicks her tongue before swirling her tongue around it, which earns a low guttural moan from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Smirking, Agatha lightly grazes the nipple with her teeth, before skillfully moving her attention to the other one. Placing a few kisses on Rio’s skin in between, she then takes the other nipple into her mouth, caressing it the same way. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, who still had her hand in Agatha’s head, forcefully drags her up, wanting Agatha’s lips on her own once more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha allows it, diving into the kiss with tongue first. Their lips and tongues crash with such force it draws a moan from Agatha - she begins to move her body on top of Rio’s in tandem with the pace of the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls away again, trying to lower her head to caress Rio’s exposed stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asks, breathlessly. Agatha sits up, looking down at her with care. </p><p> </p><p>Rio raises herself by her elbows, meeting Agatha’s lustful gaze with equal measure.</p><p> </p><p> “What?” Agatha musters, delicately placing a hand along Rio’s jawline.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we not…” Rio takes a deep breath, bracing herself for the next sentence, “do anything more, right now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her in confusion, still stroking her jaw soothingly, “Dare I ask why?”</p><p> </p><p>”Just,” Rio lays down in defeat, “Not drunk, I don’t want you to regret it tomorrow and we go back to square one.”</p><p> </p><p>“I won't” Agatha leans down to press a gentle kiss on Rio’s mouth, “But we don’t have to.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles gratefully, “Then kiss me again, you coward.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins, leaning down again to meet her lips tenderly, entering her mouth again. </p><p> </p><p>They move against each other slowly at first, simply enjoying the moment and the closeness, before it turns hungry, sloppy. Agatha lightly nibs at Rio’s bottom lip and swallows the desperate moan escaping Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss is desperate, like a release of pent-up energy. But it’s equally delicate - the respect, admiration and attraction for each other being poured out all at once into each other.</p><p> </p><p>It’s addicting, it’s consuming and Agatha never wants it to end. She could spend eternity here, simply kissing and caressing Rio’s soft body with her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, though, she pulls away - but not fully - not wanting to let go she lets Rio’s mouth linger on hers. The lips barely touch but every small, empty, breath escaping Rio's mouth feels like a faint kiss. </p><p> </p><p>“We need to sleep.” Agatha mumbles against her lips, reluctantly sitting up and climbing off Rio’s hips.  </p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, turning over to the side. “Can I stay over?” She asks, looking up at Agatha innocently.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to hide the smile that escapes her, “I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles again and Agatha has to fight the urge to kiss the smile away, so she turns around, making her way towards the bathroom to brush her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Sometime during the uber drive, she thought she’d sobered up. Feeling everything as clear as day, her thoughts, her senses. But looking at herself in the bathroom mirror she’s reminded of the tequilas, the wine and the various drinks Jen had urged her to try throughout the night.</p><p> </p><p>Although that was a few hours ago, the remindents of the alcohol still ran through her system. </p><p> </p><p>She’s suddenly grateful that Rio called it off-- a <em> one </em> time mistake, she could live with. But sleeping with her colleague <em> twice </em>in a week? Unacceptable. </p><p> </p><p>After tonight, there was no point in denying her attraction to Rio. She could even understand her drunken self for all the choices it had made. But that didn’t exclude the fact that the professional relationship between them can not be jeopardized because of some drunken desire-- Agatha needed to call this off.</p><p> </p><p>But could she?</p><p> </p><p>As she stood looking in the mirror, her thoughts clouded with images of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The way she moaned when Agatha bit her lip, or how her breath would hitch at the smallest, suggestive touch. The addicting taste of her lips, and the way her tongue would fight but eventually submit to Agatha’s subtle command. </p><p> </p><p>It was all so intoxicating and addicting-- Rio had become like alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>And like alcohol, she was a problem. </p><p> </p><p>But the addicted rarely know about the problem, and if they know, do they care? Did Agatha even care anymore?</p><p> </p><p>She walks back into her bedroom, seeing Rio still turned over to her side but with eyes shut, sleeping peacefully. There was something innocent about the scene. Her hair is a mess around her head, her chest moving rhythmically as she breathes and her arms curled up against her.</p><p> </p><p>And it’s in that moment Agatha realizes--</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t care anymore.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha wakes up the next morning, the sun is already high in the sky, the rays sneaking in from above the curtains and lightening the room.</p><p> </p><p>Having slept through her hangover, she feels great - except for a slight headache, but to her, that’s old news. </p><p> </p><p>Looking over to her side, however, drags her out of the euphoria of waking up - Rio isn’t there.</p><p> </p><p>For a few seconds, she freezes. Her mind fast forwarding through all the memories of last night. Had she pissed her off for some reason? Had Rio told her she needed to leave early?</p><p> </p><p>She’s pulled out of her anxious state mere seconds later when she hears something from the kitchen. Standing up quickly, she makes a beeline towards the origin of the sound. </p><p> </p><p>She rubs her temples in an effort to force away the headache, her feet dragging against the cold floor.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the kitchen, she sees Rio searching for something in the cabinets. Relief that Rio hadn’t left already washes over Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Instead of helping her out though, Agatha decides to stand and watch her struggle from the doorway. She hears Rio sigh after opening yet another cabinet without any luck at finding <em> whatever </em> it is she’s looking for. Agatha simply smiles, loving the entertainment, “You need any help with that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks over in surprise, clearly having no idea that Agatha had woken up, “Where do you keep your coffee?” She asked, exasperated. </p><p> </p><p>Smirking, Agatha walks over, opening the cabinet right above the coffee maker while looking at Rio mockingly.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear I looked there twice already.” Rio complains, grabbing the coffee and putting it into the machine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, “Sleep well?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, did you?” Rio asks, her demeanor entirely changed from just mere moments ago. Now there's a sense of nervousness and uncertainty. </p><p> </p><p>It pulls at Agatha’s heartstrings, she knows exactly why.</p><p> </p><p>Sighing, she sits down in the nearest chair. “You know, I’ve been thinking.” She says, choosing to ignore Rio’s question fully to focus on more important stuff.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits down, looking at, and fidgeting with her fingers. “If you’re gonna tell me to pretend like nothing happened again <em> I swear to god </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her, surprised, “What then?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> We </em> don’t have to pretend anything.” Agatha explains, “But I really <em> really </em>don’t want the team to know.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you so afraid of?” Rio asks. Her voice is genuine, not laced with anything but pure curiosity. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha sighs. “My reputation, I guess, or my authority being questioned.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her softly, “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up, “Before you go on a rant-”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t.”<br/><br/></p><p>“-I know they won’t care. But I do, isn’t that enough?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, standing up as well, “They don’t have to know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a breath of relief.</p><p> </p><p>“Besides… it’s kinda sexy, keeping a secret.” Rio says suggestively as she moves closer - their faces mere inches apart.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares up at her, fighting to retain a straight face. “You’re hilarious,” she says sarcastically, but still not taking a step back.</p><p> </p><p>In the silence that follows, Agatha has to fight every urge to lean in. The scent of Rio’s lingering perfume mixed with the promise of Rio’s kissing pulls her in.</p><p> </p><p>She places a hand reluctantly on Rio’s chest, mainly to stop herself. “Coffee is done,” she says, moving to pour up a cup for both of them. </p><p> </p><p>She hands it to Rio before walking over to her couch, sitting down and looking at Rio wavering in the kitchen. Sighing mentally, she speaks up, “Is there a problem?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins, shaking her head, before making her way over to Agatha, “so… what made you change your mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, looking out the window. She can’t tell the truth, but also it feels wrong to lie. “I see no point in lying to each other and ourselves - it happened, we can’t change it.”</p><p> </p><p>“So it wasn’t my incredible kissing skills?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “You wish.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows, “Don’t think I'll forget how you moaned when I-.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s enough.” Agatha interrupts, glaring at her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, resorting to her coffee. “I won’t let you forget, either,” she smirks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a big sip of coffee. “As if I could,” she mumbles.</p><p> </p><p>______</p><p> </p><p>Rio was right.</p><p> </p><p>The second she walks into the office the Monday after, she comes as a reminder.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits down in the office room, looking at Agatha innocently, but with a hint of desire underneath the first layer. “Good morning,” she says, sitting down in her usual seat across from Agatha in the conference room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to clear her throat before speaking, “Good morning, Vidal.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio glares at her challengingly. “I know you’re trying to act professional, and I’ll let you. But no one else is in the room with us right now, why are you being annoying?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not being annoying, I’m using your last name, like I do with everyone else - I can’t favor anyone.” Agatha explains, flipping through the files she’d been handed about the new case earlier this morning.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay but sticking your tongue in someone’s throat isn’t favoring them?” Rio comments.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up from the paperwork in disbelief, glaring at Rio, “<em> Anyone </em>could walk in.” </p><p> </p><p>Like on cue, Lilia enters the room, “Good morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha acknowledges Lilia with a simple nod in her direction before she turns back to the files in front of her. She struggles to get her mind straight, thoughts running with images of Rio from this weekend, and the weekend before that. The tension in the room between them is so thick Agatha is certain that a well qualified detective like Lilia could smell it from a mile away.</p><p> </p><p>She tries to distract her mind with work, but it’s futile. </p><p> </p><p>She hates how unprofessional Rio has made her, and on <em> so many </em>levels.</p><p> </p><p>When everyone in the team had gathered she tried to present the new case they’d been handed, but finding it nearly impossible to focus on anything else than the woman sitting across from her, staring.</p><p> </p><p>The weight of Rio’s gaze looming over her intensely. Her thoughts clouded with the memories of this weekend when she sees Rio slowly, teasingly, lick her lips.</p><p> </p><p>No one else paid attention to Rio, of course, since Agatha was the one holding the presentation - which only allowed Rio to do more damage.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha was on the topic of possible strategies, Rio stretches her neck and slowly runs her own fingers down it. She parts her lips, breathing in heavily while still keeping intense eye contact. The view was enough to make Agatha lose her footing completely.</p><p> </p><p>She clears her throat before continuing. As she trails off about the case again, she sees a smirk appear on Rio’s lips - she wants to kiss it away <em> so </em>badly. </p><p> </p><p>She closes her folder of information, officially calling off the meeting, knowing that she has at least three more points to go over. However, she needed to get out of that room as soon as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Even if being in her own office won't clear her thoughts entirely, it would be free from distractions-- free from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>She closes her office door behind her with a heavy sigh. Walking over to call the chief of the Boston police department to find out if there’s any new information essential to the continuation of the case.</p><p> </p><p>A man had been spotted around the crime scene of six crimes over massachusets. Their job now was to figure out how he was tied to the crimes: one burglary, one attempted murder, two assassinations, and two arsons. The tricky part was that he had a different alibi for every stated occasion - they had to figure out if he’s guilty and if he’s tied to an illegal organization somehow.</p><p> </p><p>The investigation was gonna require a lot of fieldwork and a lot of interviews. None of which Agatha looked forward to.</p><p> </p><p>After her debrief with the chief of police, Rio walked in.</p><p> </p><p>In an attempt to ignore her, Agatha continued writing a report of the phone call on her computer, not paying any attention to the other woman.</p><p> </p><p>But she could feel her presence from behind, towering over her and leaning forward to look at the screen. Her breath hitching as she could feel the warmth of Rio’s breaths against the side of her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio then placed a folder on Agatha’s desk nonchalantly, standing up straight. “I made a list of all the alibis and their statements - thought you might wanna look them over,” she says, walking out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is left in pure disbelief. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The rest of the week passes in a similar manner.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, trying to be the professional she is, and Rio doing everything in her power to unravel her.</p><p> </p><p>Whether that be through quick glances, smirks, gestures or suggestive remarks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could list them all.</p><p> </p><p>By the end of the week, Agatha had accepted her fate. All she could do now was play her cards right, meeting the challenge.</p><p> </p><p>So when Rio walks into her office on Thursday, Agatha is prepared.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen told me you asked her for the reports from our field investigation.” Rio says, placing two papers on Agatha’s desk and sitting down in the chair she so helpfully had placed by Agatha’s desk earlier this week.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, “I did, thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans forward, “anything else I can help you with?”</p><p> </p><p>Other times, Agatha would scoff at this and wave Rio off. But today, she decided to go off script, “Actually, I was gonna ask if you could read through this and give me your thoughts.” She pushes a paper over the table towards Rio, making sure to brush her hands before pulling away.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure.” Rio says, standing up with the paper in hand, ready to walk out.</p><p> </p><p>“And,” Agatha adds, “please button up your shirt, you look unprofessional.” Glancing pointedly down towards the few top buttons that Rio had decided to leave open.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks at that, looking down at her shirt, “You noticed?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, <em> of course </em>she’d noticed. “Yes,” She sighs, “Just like I noticed you’ve been wearing your hair down all week - you never do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits down on the edge of the desk while maintaining eye contact, “You pay a great attention to detail.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s my job.” Agatha answers bluntly, breaking eye contact to turn her attention to the screen to silently hint that the conversation was over and she wanted to be left alone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t take a hint, apparently. “What else have you noticed?” she asks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “You are extremely annoying.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right now or always?” Rio feigns a hurt expression. </p><p> </p><p>“Always. Now, please, leave me alone - I need to get back to work.” Agatha dismisses with a wave of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t move, simply sitting there, watching Agatha as if she didn’t herself have work to do. </p><p> </p><p>“I was actually gonna ask you something.” She says eventually, when Agatha had almost forgotten she’s there, <em> almost </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waves her hand again as if to say ‘<em> go on </em>’.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to watch a movie tomorrow night? Maybe have dinner?”</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha had a drink in her mouth, she would’ve spat it out in pure shock from Rio’s recklessness, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>“As colleagues.” Rio adds, carefully. “Maybe I just want to spend my Friday night with someone, we don’t have to do anything.”</p><p> </p><p>And at that, Agatha actually rethinks the proposition. She looks up at Rio, “Only if you promise not to try anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why? Can’t you control yourself?” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I can,” Agatha scoffs, “I’m just not so sure you can.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, holding up her hands in defeat, “Okay I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, “Then why not.”</p><p> </p><p>Without another word, Rio walks out.</p><p> </p><p>_______</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>In hindsight, accepting the offer was a bad idea - Agatha knew it.</p><p> </p><p>Them in an apartment, alone, on a friday night, wasn’t the brightest idea. At this point, Agatha just had to trust herself, and trust Rio’s promise of not pursuing her. </p><p> </p><p>It was a dangerous bargain. But spending a night with Rio was more appealing than what would otherwise be a normal Friday night in Agatha’s life. </p><p> </p><p>Which was, ultimately, the sole reason Agatha had agreed to meeting in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>She was obviously attracted to Rio - otherwise the last few weeks wouldn’t have happened. But that didn’t mean she couldn’t be civil, that she didn’t have self control. </p><p> </p><p>Sighing heavily, she put on a shirt and pair of comfortable pants, hoping that her more laid-back attitude would somehow help to direct the evening away from the date-like feeling that was looming over her.</p><p> </p><p>She was pacing around her apartment, knowing that any second Rio could ring on her doorbell, and this stupid night would be a fact, not just a mere idea in Agatha’s head.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to pull herself together-- take a few deep breaths, drink a glass of water and maybe ten glasses of wine to prepare herself. </p><p> </p><p>The second her mind had been set on having at least one glass, Rio knocked on her door.</p><p> </p><p>Cursing, she stomps over to the front door, opening it with a swift motion. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stands outside, more beautiful than Agatha wants to admit. Her dark hair in a gorgeous curly chaos, eyes even darker as she looked up, smiling, “Hi.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” Agatha steps aside to let her guest in, nervously pacing her hall while Rio takes off her coat. “I’m afraid I haven’t had time to prepare dinner.”</p><p> </p><p>By ‘<em> haven’t had time’ </em>Agatha really meant taking a thorough shower, choosing an outfit, looking at herself in the mirror for too long and then pacing her apartment - but she can’t very well admit that to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh don’t worry, I can help.” Rio says, walking in with familiar steps towards the kitchen. “What are we eating?” </p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking of spaghetti with tomato sauce.” Agatha says, walking towards the kitchen with a much more nervousness than Rio had mere seconds ago. “I bought some fancy cheese as well if that’s of any interest.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles and nods, “Sounds great. Can I help in any way?” </p><p> </p><p>“If you could chop the tomatoes I can start with the pasta.” Agatha suggests, taking out a saucepan along with a cutting board and handing it to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Soon they fall into a steady rhythm, cooking in silence as they move about the kitchen. Once again the feeling of domesticity clings tight to Agatha and she has to shake it off - a <em> dangerous </em>thought of how intimate this entire process is, how well they work together.</p><p> </p><p>It’s as if they can read each other, moving in tandem about the kitchen, never once bumping into each other. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to disregard the electrical pull that she feels towards Rio as she moves about the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“What do we want to drink, red wine or white?” Agatha asks eventually, when the timer for the pasta had been set, holding a flask in either hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs, “Water, thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Agatha is thrown back. She still remembered what Rio had said a week ago, ‘<em> not drunk </em>’, and Agatha had listened. She knew where Rio was coming from, it was a bad idea to sleep with each other when both of them were drunk out of their minds - but she’d never seen Rio deny an offer for alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Agatha felt bad for wanting to drink wine - but she really needed to get her sooth her nerves. “You sure, not even one glass?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head, “No, but you feel free to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew this was a challenge, deep down. If she drank there was a high chance- <em> risk </em>?- that  Rio wouldn’t sleep with her tonight. But then again, she was the one who imposed the rules - she was the one who asked Rio to not try anything tonight. </p><p> </p><p>So if drinking wine would lower the chance of a potential mistake being made-- <em> why </em>did she struggle so much in deciding what to do?</p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, Agatha settles on a cider she kept in her pantry. It wasn’t enough alcohol to become influenced by, but it tastes better with the food than water.</p><p> </p><p>A grin escapes the corner of Rio’s mouth when Agatha decides against the wine. Gladly she accepts the third offer of cider instead.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up to finish the last steps of cooking while Rio remains seated, watching while sipping on her cider.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s eyes on her, making her feel uneasy and cornered within her own home. The effect this woman has on her needs to be studied. </p><p> </p><p>She places the bowl on the table, along with a baguette and some cream cheese. It was an easy dish, but fancy enough to be considered appropriate for when she had guests over.</p><p> </p><p>She’d never been a good cook, but after years of having to cook for herself she knew at least a few recipes-- and this was one of the dishes she was most confident in, often resulting in it the few times she had company.</p><p> </p><p>Rio digs in in a heartbeat, making a sound dangerously close to a moan when she tastes the food. “This is really good,” She compliments, mouth still full of food.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles, filling her own plate with pasta, “Tell me about yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up from her food, “What do you want to know?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha sighs, her back hitting the back of the chair while watching Rio while drinking a few sips of the cider-- ‘<em> red wine would taste better </em>’ she thinks bitterly. “I don’t know much about you.”</p><p> </p><p>“This feels awfully a lot like a date, Agatha.” Rio teases. “Hello, my name is Rio, I’m 36.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at her.</p><p> </p><p>Chuckling, Rio places down her fork and crosses her arms, leaning back, “What do you want to know, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Forget I asked,” Agatha mumbles, taking a bite of her food.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know I’m from New Jersey?” Rio asks eventually.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, she really didn’t know anything about this woman, “what compelled you to move?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs, “Uni… mostly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you visit your hometown often?” Agatha asks, genuinely curious.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, no.” Rio says, the teasing glint in her eye suddenly gone, replaced with something else - something more complicated. “My parents died when I was young, so I was placed in foster care - the day I turned 18 I was thrown out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is taken aback, not expecting that answer, “I’m sorry.” She says, placing a soothing hand on Rio’s arm over the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be sorry, it was almost 20 years ago.” Rio sighs.</p><p> </p><p>“I was also thrown out,” Agatha says, after a while - not sure on whether to tell this story or not. “Not by a foster family - by my real mom.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio says, looking down at the hand still stroking her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be, it was almost 30 years ago.” Agatha teases, a glint in her eye.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles, but Agatha can tell it’s not fully genuine.</p><p> </p><p>“She told me I was born evil… that death followed where I went.” Agatha says, reaching for her glass wanting it to be wine <em> really badly </em>. “At first, I didn’t believe her. But-” She stifles a sob.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her carefully, “It wasn’t your fault.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles weakly, “He was born sick, if anything, it <em> was </em> my fault. He became sick while still in my body-- <em> my </em> body made him sick.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio places her hand on Agatha’s, rubbing soothing circles into it, “Don’t blame yourself. I know it’s hard, I blame myself for my parents death - but it isn’t black and white.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her through teary eyes, “What happened to your parents?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinches, “They died when I was four… car crash. They were gonna pick me up from my grandmothers because I didn’t want to stay the night-- if i hadn’t <em> insisted </em>on going home they wouldn’t have..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches over the table, pulling a strand of hair out of Rio’s face and dragging it behind her ear, “You were <em> four </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio says, “but I still blame myself-- sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, still not removing her hand from Rio’s face, caressing her cheek lightly while looking at her with big, comforting eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Rio fights a fragile smile, “Don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reluctantly removes her hand, going back to her food. They were treading a thin rope, almost waiting for the other one to crack and fall.</p><p> </p><p>The game was addictive, and the outcome even more so. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t intended on anything else than bringing comfort, but the way Rio looked at her and the silent demand was enough confirmation that it wasn’t only about that.</p><p> </p><p>She glances up from her plate, meeting Rio’s eyes. They were full of an undeniable sadness that Agatha had never seen before, but the way she looked at Agatha was with pure admiration. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha brings the glass to her lips, taking a sip while still not breaking eye contact. </p><p> </p><p>The tension was palpable, even more so after Agatha’s stunt on her cheek. It filled the silent room, creeping its way into every corner and heavy breath between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio clears her throat, “What movie do you want to watch later?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up to put away her plate in the dishwasher, “You decide, I’m not picky.”</p><p> </p><p>She <em> is </em>, in fact, very picky. But she couldn’t even bring herself to care about what god awful movie Rio was probably gonna choose, knowing that she wouldn’t be able to focus on anything during the entire runtime.</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles slightly, standing up as well, “How about ‘Scream’?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at her, “What are you, 18?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio places her plate in the dishwasher, causing their arms to accidentally touch. A chill runs down Agatha’s spine and in response, she quickly stands up, shaking her head to get the running thoughts out of her mind - this was gonna be a <em> long </em>night.</p><p> </p><p>“You said I can pick,” Rio says mockingly, “what do you have against ‘Scream’?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve seen it once, and it’s not as thrilling when you know who the killer is.” Agatha explains matter-of-factly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, and everything needs to be thrilling to you does it?” Rio smirks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, a blush starting to creep up behind her neckline - ‘<em> I walked myself right over into that one </em>’ she thinks, annoyed with herself. “I need a cigarette,” she blurts out, walking towards her balcony without looking back.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t <em> really </em>need the cigarette, but she was in dire need of a reason to get away. </p><p> </p><p>Outside, she takes a few unhurried deep breaths, trying to calm her nerves that seemed to have been on edge the entire night, with exception for the heartfelt conversation they shared over dinner. </p><p> </p><p>She puts the cigarette on her lips, lighting it and taking a slow ragged breath in. It was cold outside, and she’d, in her rush, forgotten to bring her coat. In hindsight, she regretted not stopping by the hall.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t realize last week wasn’t a one time thing.” A voice says behind her, causing Agatha to promptly turn around. “You didn’t bring your coat,” Rio says, handing it over.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha mumbles, placing the cigarette between her lips to put the coat on in one swift motion. The warmth engulfed her in seconds, her breath steadying. </p><p> </p><p>Rio walks over to the railing. The view from Agatha’s 11th story apartment is beautiful, which was one of the reasons she decided on this apartment in the first place - you could see the harbor somewhere in between the big skyscrapers.</p><p> </p><p>Now, during a friday night, it was livelier down by the streets - laughter and occasional car horns could be heard all the way up along with very faint club music. </p><p> </p><p>The light from below cast a hollow light on Rio’s face. Agatha could see the contours of her side profile, how her nose so delicately turned upwards, and how her lips, slightly parted, had a beautifully natural curve to them.</p><p> </p><p>Needing to ground herself, Agatha took a drag out of her cigarette, looking out over the skyline as well. </p><p> </p><p>As they stand there in silence, she tries desperately to grasp on any last sense of dignity and self-respect she can muster. It’s futile.</p><p> </p><p>Seemingly unaware, Rio was consuming her every thought. </p>

<p>Agatha grabs a blanket from her bedroom before walking over to the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting down in the far corner, she tries to keep a safe distance between herself and Rio, and to further prove her point she wraps herself tightly in the blanket. It wasn’t just that she  needed the physical restraint and wall between them, she convinced herself, because she was also cold as hell after spending ten minutes on the balcony. </p><p> </p><p>Hands like icicles, she grabs the remote control to put on the movie - making sure to roll her eyes dramatically as a statement before pressing play.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits down by the other end of the couch, smiling proudly when Agatha puts on the movie, ignoring her snark behavior.</p><p> </p><p>Scream wasn’t Rio’s favorite movie either, per se, but it was a good lazy watch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t watched it since it came out when she was 20, and she had no recollection of the story, but she had to admit that it <em> was </em>a great movie - not at all scary, but at least it was entertaining. </p><p> </p><p>She tried to keep up with the story during the beginning, mostly in an attempt to forget about the woman beside her on the couch. </p><p> </p><p>However, that became more difficult after about half an hour, when Rio placed her legs in Agatha’s lap. For a second, Agatha’s head started swirling, unsure of what to do. But she was also aware that this, whatever Rio was doing, could be viewed as a friendly gesture.</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha, it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She had no idea what Rio’s underlying motivations could be, and even if there weren’t any, it put her on edge.</p><p> </p><p>Feeling oddly out of place with her hands on the couch beneath her, she places them on Rio’s legs, trying to act as nonchalant as Rio had.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what she was expecting, but she kind of thought Rio would shrug away her legs the second she touched them. So, when she doesn’t, it creates a spark of pride - maybe they could stay like this, just comfortable together?</p><p> </p><p>Every now and again, the complete stillness would be broken by one of them reaching for their glass on the table. Everytime Rio did it, Agatha would tense up, feeling like some sacred silence had been broken. </p><p> </p><p>“I swear to god why is she running <em> up </em>the stairs?” Rio suddenly bursts out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost jumps. “They’re doing a parody of other horror movies,” she dead-pans.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, “I’m not stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why the hell are you complaining?” Agatha says, trying to come off harsh but it sounds more teasing-- if anything.</p><p> </p><p>Rio averts her eyes from the screen, “I’m just saying, if I was in this scenario I’d be smarter than Sidney.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins, “I’m sure you would.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grunts, looking back at the tv.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs, and the silence that follows is even more comfortable than earlier. Slowly, she allows herself to relax into the couch.</p><p> </p><p>She has a hard time focusing on the movie after that, attention flickering between the tv screen and the woman beside her. She watches the steady rhythm of Rio’s chest as she’s breathing, and the way she fidgets with the silver amulet on her necklace-- <em> a dagger </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I have a blanket?” Rio asks, looking pointedly at the way Agatha’s still cozily wrapped up.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s one on my bed,” Agatha says, pointing towards the bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, “I can’t be bothered.”</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha scoffs, “that’s not my problem.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t we share then?” Rio sits up, removing her legs from their place on Agatha’s lap and looks at her, almost beggingly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha would lie if she said it didn’t make her fold.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” she scoffs, trying to play it off. </p><p> </p><p>Rio moves over, sitting down closer to Agatha so that the blanket would reach both of them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew that Rio didn’t need to sit <em> that close </em> - their legs touching each other - but she couldn’t find it herself to actually move or complain so that Rio would.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s leg against her feels both like an electrical shock and a comfortable, familiar warmth. She wants to find it unnerving, unwelcome even. But somewhere within her, she can’t help but embrace the feeling of Rio against her, despite it not being skin to skin.</p><p> </p><p>Unsure of what to do with her hands and definitely without any rational thinking, Agatha, in a weak second, decides to place her palm on Rio’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>She can feel Rio tense up under the light pressure of her hand, and for a second she wants to retreat, to place her hand awkwardly back in her own lap. </p><p> </p><p>But it’s already been done, a barrier has been broken. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly forgetting about all of her own rules, she starts moving her hand slowly up Rio’s thigh, hearing Rio’s breath hitch only spurring her on.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio asks, breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p>“Testing something.” Agatha says, sounding a lot more comfortable than she feels.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns and looks directly at Agatha, “Don’t make me break a promise.”<br/><br/></p><p>“I’m not making you do anything,” Agatha smirks - at this point having abandoned all her morals a long time ago.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitches when Agatha reaches up dangerously high on her thigh, “Kinda feels like you are.”</p><p> </p><p>Without missing a beat, Agatha removes her hand. Hearing a faint whimper from Rio at the loss of contact is enough to make her grin, turning her attention back to the tv.</p><p> </p><p>The silence that once again settles over them is deafening, but this time, Agatha thrives in it. Knowing she, for once, had managed to turn the tables on Rio left her satisfied enough to last a lifetime.</p><p> </p><p>She knew that if Rio was true to her word, this wouldn’t lead to anything - and right now Agatha didn’t know if she <em> wanted </em>it to.</p><p> </p><p>Well, she did. Rio was insanely intoxicating and it was only a matter of time before Agatha fell into her trap again. Something that Agatha had again and again had reminded herself could <em> not happen </em>. </p><p> </p><p>However, for every second passed in Rio’s presence it’s like Agatha forgets all about that. Every promise she’d ever made to herself thrown out the window, and she begins to question every decision about staying away from Rio she’s ever made.</p><p> </p><p>Without even realizing it herself, Agatha’s hand is back on Rio’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Brain still foggy but her intentions clear - she wanted Rio to break.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stifles a sigh when Agatha slowly begins stroking along the inside of her thigh, with no indication to stop, “What are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, no longer paying any attention on the tv, watches Rio closely, “What I want.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her in disbelief, “<em> You’re </em> the one who told me you <em> didn’t </em>want-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha interrupts sternly. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins, “Shut up.”  </p><p> </p><p>Rio closes her lips tightly, as if she needs to physically hold herself from speaking any further. Agatha looks at her, and even if she’s a few inches taller, Rio feels so small compared to her at that moment. </p><p> </p><p>She places her palm carefully against Rio’s cheek, running her thumb slowly across the bottom of her lips, parting them slightly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her through hooded eyes, causing a shiver to run down Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Losing all sense of self respect, Agatha leans in.</p><p> </p><p>At first, the kiss is tender, nothing but lips meeting lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans into it, bringing her hand from Rio’s face to the back of her head, tugging slightly at her hair to press her further into the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Then she removes her hand from Rio’s inner thigh, slowly circling her leg until she gets a grip underneath. In one swift motion, she moves Rio to sit on top of her, wanting the feeling of their entire bodies pressed together.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, now straddling Agatha’s hips, brings her arms around her neck and presses her entire upper body to Agatha, making Agatha’s back hit the back of the couch with a thud. </p><p> </p><p>Carefully, Agatha licks Rio’s lips in an attempt to deepen the kiss. When the action isn’t reciprocated she is instead forced to other measures.</p><p> </p><p>With an unexpected move, she opens her mouth against Rio’s, bringing Rio’s bottom lip between her teeth gently, earling an audible moan from Rio, who opens her mouth fully, letting Agatha enter her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does. </p><p> </p><p>In seconds, the kiss goes from tender to something more aggressive, attacking and thirsty. Agatha’s hand, now on Rio’s hip, moving her in a perfect rhythm with the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>With her other hand, she forces Rio’s head further to the side to earn more access into her mouth. Rio gladly complies, letting Agatha control her every motion. </p><p> </p><p>Their mouths move against each other feveriously, tongues and teeth clashing. But Agatha can’t seem to mind it, loving every second.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, she’s dragged out of her haze by Rio pulling away, placing both her palms against Agatha’s chest. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her questioningly, dazy eyed.</p><p> </p><p>“What are we doing?” Rio whispers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at here, gaze going from admiring to something more fierce, “You’re asking too many god damn questions.” Removing her hand from Rio’s hair, she slowly trails two fingers along the buttons of Rio’s shirt, trying to answer the question inaudibly.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure about this?” Rio asks, again in a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, “Another question.” Leaning in and teasing her lips on Rio’s, she can feel the hitched breath escaping Rio. “But yes,” she mumbles, this time feeling the way their lips brush against each other.  </p><p> </p><p>Rio closes her eyes, breathing slowly, “And you won't regret it tomorrow?”</p><p> </p><p>“I swear to-” Agatha interrupts herself by slamming her lips hard against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasps in shock, but still lets Agatha enter her mouth hungrily, kissing back with equal measure.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brings her hands to the first button on Rio’s shirt, slowly moving upwards</p><p> </p><p>After a few buttons, she gives up and instead takes the bottom of the shirt, pulling it off over Rio’s head. </p><p> </p><p>They break the kiss momentarily before Agatha eagerly leans in again. This time running her hands down Rio’s exposed chest and stomach, feeling the goosebumps in her wake.</p><p> </p><p>Head dizzy, she starts following the edge of Rio’s bra with her left hand, feeling the laced edges against her fingertips. She reaches back, smoothly unbuckling the bra and dragging it off.</p><p> </p><p>Breaking the kiss, she looks at Rio, mouth watering at the pure sight of her. Hair disheveled, lips parted and a little swollen with a hungry, almost animalistic, look in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dives in like a woman starved, kissing her way from Rio’s jaw, right by her pulse point, down to her collarbones. This time, without care for leaving an accidental mark, she gently bites the skin by her collarbones - a red spot forming in her wake.</p><p> </p><p>Expertly, she moves her lips down to Rio’s pointed nipple, instantly taking it in her mouth - swirling a skillful tongue around it before biting down promptly, earning a loud moan from Rio somewhere above her.</p><p> </p><p>She looks up, still caressing Rio’s nipple, and watches as she throws her head back, making a sound so sinful it makes a heat pool in the bottom of Agatha’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Moving over to the other nipple, her eyes are still entirely focused on Rio. She examines the way Rio squirms under her touch, how her throat wobbles as she stifles her moans and the way her eyes flutter shut when Agatha flicks her tongue <em> just right </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, with a swift motion, she lets go of the nipple with a <em> pop </em> . Sitting up straight, she pushes Rio down on the couch, climbing on top of her, straddling her hips in an <em> oh so </em>familiar matter.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio’s back hits the soft cushions, she does it with a loud thud - not once flinching. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, watching Rio’s facial expressions from above - her eyes full of anticipation and desire. </p><p> </p><p>Leaning down, she once again connects their lips, pushing her tongue naturally into her mouth, like she belonged there. At that thought, a scary feeling hits her suddenly-- <em> She did. </em> </p><p> </p><p>In an attempt to shake off the thought, she once again released Rio’s lips, bringing her own down her neck.</p><p> </p><p>With a confident hand, she reaches in between them, grabbing at the waistband of Rio’s jeans, working to unbutton them while her other hand traces long strokes along the side of her waist, feeling every curve beneath her fingertips. </p><p> </p><p>Breaking the kiss, Agatha slips her hand down Rio’s jeans, gently applying two fingers on top of Rio’s underwear. “Didn’t think you’d be this wet already,” she teases and gives a quick kiss on her lips to weigh out the humiliation.</p><p> </p><p>She starts to rub languidly on the fabric over Rio’s clit, who throws her head back in a guttural moan at the touch. </p><p> </p><p>Smirking, Agatha speeds up her ministrations, leaning down to lick teasingly over Rio’s perked nipple.</p><p> </p><p>Without second thought, she pushes the lacy underwear to the side, moving two fingers along her wet folds with a sense of overwhelming pride.</p><p> </p><p>She’d done this.</p><p> </p><p><em> Again </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Finding her clit, Agatha starts to rub tauntingly slow circles over it, keeping her pressure light in an attempt to edge Rio on. Cleary not delighted by the choice, Rio groans in annoyance, trying to apply the pressure herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha removes her hand as punishment for Rio’s actions, causing yet another groan to escape her lips.</p><p> </p><p>She leans down, “Don’t you dare.” The whisper hits Rio’s ears with a sudden warmth, a shiver running down her spine. Squirming, she tries to get out of the hold Agatha now has placed on her hip.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares down at her with daring eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You weren’t this annoying last time,” Rio complains, still writhing under Agatha’s unyielding grip.</p><p> </p><p>“That, sweetheart, is because I was drunk last time. But this time,” Agatha leans down again, biting Rio’s nipple softly, “you’re not getting away <em> that </em>easily.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio arches her back so Agatha’s touch would linger, no real words but still audible protests escaping her mouth when Agatha promptly sits up.</p><p> </p><p>She places a careful hand on Rio’s jaw, locking her eyes, “Are you gonna continue being annoying?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs her jaw harder, turning her head to force eye contact, “Words, pretty girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites her lip for a second before she sees the aggravated look in Agatha’s eyes. “I won’t” she says, sighing in defeat.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha praises, grabbing the waistline of Rio’s jeans and panties to pull them down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifts her hips to ease the motion, a breathy moan escaping her when air hits her cunt.</p><p> </p><p>Chuckling, Agatha once again dips her fingers down, teasing the hole for a few seconds before slowly making her way to the clit. </p><p> </p><p>Confident that Rio wouldn’t try to squirm her way out this time, she replaces the hand she earlier had on her hips onto the inside of her thigh, forcing them to part.</p><p> </p><p>The new angle, one leg bent over the back of the sofa and one foot on the floor, allowed Agatha more access. Unhurriedly, she climbs off Rio and places herself in the middle of her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>She leans down and blows lightly on Rio’s cunt. Seeing her twitch underneath, she smirks, looking up at Rio while licking in a line up her slit before circling the clit with a few, languid licks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers softly as Agatha closes her lips around the sensitive bud, sucking and applying the amount of pressure Rio had been craving.</p><p> </p><p>With one hand, Agatha reaches up and starts massaging Rio’s breasts, flicking the nipple with her thumb before pinching it between thumb and pointer, again earning a beautiful gasp.</p><p> </p><p>With the other hand, she carefully starts teasing at the wet entrance, circling the hole a few times before slowly pushing in one finger down to her knuckles. </p><p><br/>Rio arches her back, a shiver running down her spine. Agatha adds yet another finger, speeding up the movement. </p><p> </p><p>A few seconds later, Rio’s body crashes, her muscles tensing up around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha continues her assault on Rio’s clit, laying her tongue flat against it, then going back to sucking on it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tenses up, her climax very close, Agatha can feel it beneath her touch.</p><p> </p><p>For a second, she debates whether or not to pull away, to make Rio’s suffering and squirming beneath her go on for as long as she wants-- again and again.</p><p> </p><p>But her own pleasure had been building up, heat pooling at the bottom of her stomach and the need for her own release overbearing.</p><p> </p><p>With a few more pumps of her fingers and flicks on Rio’s nipple, she can feel Rio’s orgasm rippling through her with a loud moan. </p><p> </p><p>She continues her movements, helping Rio through the height of her climax, before pulling away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, with her head thrown back, arched back and still panting, has never looked more beautiful-- Agatha was sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>She leans forward and places her mouth on top of Rio’s, easily slipping her tongue inside her parted lips. With feverous licks, she lets Rio taste herself on her tongue, moaning deeply into the kiss while she feels herself irking with need.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands search their way down Agatha’s chest, gripping the bottom of her shirt in an attempt to pull it off her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches between them, grabbing Rio’s hand, harshly and breaking the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>She looks down at Rio, her eyes full of lust. “Let me…,” she says, practically begging.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks down at her with mock empathy. “Bedroom,” she demands - wanting, but unable, to deny Rio even a second longer.</p><p> </p><p>She stands up, making a beeline to the bedroom, leaving Rio to gather herself on the couch. It takes Rio a shorter time than she’d expected, because not even a minute later, she joins her in the bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting in bed, leaning against the headboard, Agatha watches as Rio leans against the doorframe - her stomach flipping at the sight. </p><p> </p><p>“Come here,” she says, gesturing to her lap. The attempt to sound nonchalant fails terribly, as it comes out more demanding than she’d expected. </p><p> </p><p>Rio lingers by the door - the wavering demeanor at first worrying, before Agatha sees the spread out smirk on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha sits up straighter, glaring at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Caving, Rio shrugs, feigning an indifference that is completely see-through, and makes her way over to the bed. </p><p> </p><p>A grin escapes the corners of Agatha’s mouth, “Good girl.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk falters when the compliment lands. She sits down, straddling Agatha, their faces mere inches from each other.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a few deep, ragged breaths, their mouths barely touching. </p><p> </p><p>Rio closes her eyes, relaxing and placing her entire weight on Agatha’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brings up her hand, slowly pulling a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear while a smile escapes her. For a second, she lets herself be consumed by the beauty of her, the way her eyelids flutter, eyelashes touching the very top of her cheeks, the way her nose is slightly turned upwards.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to caress every feature.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she leans in, letting Rio’s lips gently press against her own.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans into the kiss, and Agatha’s eyelids flutter shut - letting Rio’s touch swallow her whole.</p><p> </p><p>With the gravity of a black hole, Rio sucks her in, hands circling Agatha’s neck in a way that feels almost <em> too </em>familiar by now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches in between them, crossing her arms, breaking the kiss for a second to drag her shirt over her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio replaces her hands, running them slowly down Agatha’s chest and stomach with attentive intent.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio reaches the waistband of Agatha’s pants, dipping her fingers underneath to get a sure grip before dragging them down in one, swift motion. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifts her hips to ease the action, feeling the anticipation burn deep inside her.</p><p> </p><p>With steady hands, she takes a fistful of Rio’s hair, and forces Rio’s head down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio complies, slowly and placing gentle kisses down Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilts her head back, allowing more access, while encouraging Rio with languid strokes on her waist, admiring her naked body beneath her fingertips.</p><p> </p><p>Patience wavering, Agatha harshly grabs Rio’s hair, lowering her head until she’s between her thighs, dangerously close to where she desperately needed her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio places two strong hands on the inside of her thighs, spreading them vigorously. She reaches up to the edge of Agatha’s purple lace underwear, looking at her through big, brown eyes; a question.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, getting in a more comfortable position. With one hand still deep in the roots of Rio’s hair, she takes the other and grips the top of the headboard in preparation.</p><p> </p><p>Teasingly slow, Rio pulls off Agatha’s underwear - leaving her exposed beneath her.</p><p> </p><p>The air hits Agatha’s core with such an infuriating emptiness it leaves her aching.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leans in and presses slow, delicate kisses to Agatha’s inner thigh, occasionally biting down before smoothing the skin with a kiss and continuing upwards.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel her patience waning as Rio smirks against her skin - obviously aware of what she’s doing.</p><p> </p><p>With a groan, Agatha looks up at the ceiling, trying to contain herself from dragging Rio towards her-- it takes <em> a lot </em> of self restraint.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s featherlight teasing on her skin feels like bittersweet torture. Agatha never wants this moment to end, to have Rio placed between her thighs forever, but she also needs it to <em> end </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Right when she grabs the headboard enough to make her knuckles go white, Rio dives in.<br/><br/></p><p>At first it's a featherlight touch, tongue gliding along her slit. A small whimper can be heard, which encourages Rio enough to circle her clit, once lightly-- teasingly, before applying more pressure. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head falls back in a guttural moan, Rio’s tongue working in circles. Unable to stop herself, Agatha harshly holds onto Rio’s hair, forcing her to add even more pressure.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a light moan at the maneuver, sending vibrations through Agatha’s body. </p><p> </p><p>With a sudden hurriedness, Rio starts sucking on her clit, earning all possible sinful sounds to escape the woman above her.</p><p> </p><p>Smirking, she lightly bites down before she, without warning, enters two fingers, pumping them at a dangerous speed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sees stars, eyes rolling back - sure she’s reached heaven.</p><p> </p><p>She replaces her tongue with her thumb, and starts slowly kissing up Agatha’s stomach, which tenses under her caressing. She takes one nipple in her mouth, still continuing her ministrations on Agatha’s clit with her finger, feeling her squirming, closer to release.</p><p> </p><p>The muscles in Agatha’s thighs tenses up and all her senses on high alert. She shuts her eyes, feeling the dangerously intoxicating scent of Rio along with the pace she’s relentlessly keeping up is enough to push Agatha over the edge.</p><p> </p><p>Her entire body tightens, back arching and thighs pressing together, as Rio continues her movements, guiding her through the orgasm. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha releases her hand from Rio’s now tangled hair, looking down at her with admiration. For a few seconds she almost feels stuck in that high, never wanting to go back down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio places her head on Agatha's stomach to relax as they breathe in tandem. Both of them closing their eyes and enjoying the moment for as long as they allow it to go on. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha struggles to sit up with Rio’s added weight, but eventually the woman raises her head, enabling Agatha to move.</p><p> </p><p>In an unexpected move, Agatha flips them over, placing herself over Rio and watching as her head catches up - confusion apparent in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Smirking, Agatha leans down and presses a soft kiss on Rio’s lips, “You thought we were done?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her and within the depths of her eyes Agatha can spot something else-- <em> desire </em>.</p><p><br/>Excitement runs through her veins as she leans down, brushing her lips against Rio’s ear, “Oh, honey, we’re only getting started.”</p><p> </p><p>With slow, languid movements she reaches down with her hand, a delicate movement from the top of her jaw, down her side, and over her stomach. She feels the goosebumps in her wake, the way Rio tenses up beneath her fingertips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, placing her lips right above Rio’s.“Let’s see how well you respond to just my fingers,” every whispered word, a ghost to the touch-- a spoken promise.</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>They had been sitting in the kitchen for a while now, sipping coffee in comfortable silence - well it wasn’t entirely comfortable because a looming feeling of an inevitability was hanging over them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew they needed to speak about this eventually, sooner than later, even if it made her feel uneasy.</p><p> </p><p>She drums her fingers impatiently on the coffee mug in front of her. Rio sat across from her by the table, not looking up to meet Agatha’s eyes who was watching every movement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was once again fidgeting with her dagger necklace - a nervous habit, Agatha had come to realize. She looked like an animal out of their habitat, supposed to be in bed. Her hair was still a tangled mess, and dark circles had become visible under her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“So…” Agatha starts, wiggling uncomfortably in her seat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her, meeting her gaze head-on. A silent, unspoken plea could be detected in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“No speaking about this at the office?” Agatha adds, her thoughts still a mess, unsure of how to communicate this properly. </p><p> </p><p>Because how do you properly tell someone you just had the best sex of your life with, that you want to continue doing it?</p><p> </p><p>Even worse… if she’s your colleague?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was unsure. But she was confident, however, somewhere in her own self doubt. She wanted Rio, not romantically, but she <em> definitely </em>doesn’t want last night to be a one time thing.</p><p> </p><p><em> Two </em> time thing, really.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t find it in herself to demand more than what had been given to her - nor could she deny to herself anymore that she liked Rio’s company, even if just in bed. </p><p> </p><p>Last night was the first time in <em> a long time </em>where she felt alive. She had felt her own heart beating, heard her own breathing and felt everything beneath her fingertips. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio was the reason behind it all.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to keep chasing the high, to touch Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>It was torture, seeing her accross the table, knowing that she can’t. The body she’d gotten so familiar with last night, and during the other nights before, suddenly out of reach.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want her out of reach. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, exasperated, “We have this conversation every time, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t done.” Agatha says, sharply, her patience about to run out. She takes a deep breath, preparing herself for the next sentence, “If you… I mean if we want to like, I don't know, continue this,” she exhales slowly, trying to steady herself, “I wouldn’t mind. Or, I mean, I wouldn’t say no.”</p><p> </p><p>The words tasted bitter on her mouth, but she knew deep down that she meant every single one.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, a smirk teasing the corners of her mouth, “Continue what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, she knows that Rio is playing with her, but she feels like she owes her some honesty after all this time, “Fucking?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chokes on her coffee, not ready for the bluntness of that answer, “To make sure I understand… You want to continue this, as like fuck buddies?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, though not entirely happy with the word choice.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck buddies with your colleague?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha backtracks, “When you say it like that…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, “I’m joking, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets out a sigh of relief, happy she hasn’t made an entire fool out of herself, “No feelings though. I’ve already gone a step too far, <em> dating </em>a colleague is another level of madness.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks, “Don’t you worry.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha <em> should </em>be happy for that answer, and on the surface she is, smiling tightly as if they’d just done a deal.</p><p> </p><p>Then why can she feel the hurt pull her heartstrings?</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha walks into the office Monday morning with a newfound energy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to run around, per se, but she walked with a lightness in her step into the conference room that morning. Not because the case had gone great - they were still struggling with a few details. But the simplified situation between her and Rio had made her less anxious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was still scared, of course, that the others would find out. But, she knew now that she and Rio were on the same page - they could sleep together, without feelings. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was the best bargain Agatha could have ever hoped for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sitting down in her chair, she leans back and takes a heavy sip out of her black coffee, closing her eyes and letting the feeling of an early Monday overtake her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Compared to other people, a Monday morning didn’t stress her out. In fact, she felt the complete opposite.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, she used to, before Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After their first time sleeping together the entire office had become an anxiety hub. But now, for the first time in weeks, it wasn’t anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio walks in about ten minutes later, after both Lilia and Billy had already taken their places around the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked tired, but not in a depressing or worrying way. She had her hair up in a loose bun, a few buttons on her blue shirt left open. The look of someone trying to look presentable, but still not too much - and in Agatha’s humble opinion, not enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t need Rio to be a walkable distraction, not today, not this week.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she couldn’t find it in herself to actually be mad about it though, rather she found it somewhat amusing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She smiles and gives a quick nod in Rio’s direction when she walks in - which was more than she’d given any other colleague that day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This case had been gnawing at her insides ever since they got it last week. It was complicated, with way too many variables to account for during their process. And it pissed Agatha off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning everyone,” She says, standing up when everybody’s arrived. “Well, as you might know, we didn’t get far last week on this investigation. We now know he’s guilty for the burglary - and that the witness who gave him the false alibi doesn't work for him like we originally thought.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>She walks over to the whiteboard, drawing up a chaotic mind map, “We need to figure out how he's tied to the assassinations - those are the most important. We find the link and then we can hand the case over to the court. That means less hassle for us. I want this guy behind bars as soon as possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would we take a shortcut?” Rio asks, Agatha’s eyes leave the whiteboard for a second, glaring at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t mind Rio’s questions, usually. It made them work more efficiently since sharing her opinions erased any possibility of conflict later on in the process.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But this time, it pissed her off. “It’s not a shortcut, </span>
<em>
<span>darling</span>
</em>
<span>, it’s a good way to get this over with. As quickly as possible,” She scoffs, taking a big sip of her coffee. </span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks, “But I thought you liked it deliberate and thought through?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha almost chokes on the beverage, words suddenly stuck in her throat and a sudden tension between them. She swallows her anger, trying to not let it consume her as she turns back to the whiteboard. “Well, in other cases, yes. But right now we’re still stuck on step one and it’s been </span>
<em>
<span>a week</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay but the field work me and Jen did last week surely helped on the arson case we linked him too downtown? Let me set up a team, and we can gather more information.” Rio asks, or rather demands. Agatha turns around in shock at the blunt request, noticing how Rio is practically lying down in her chair, completely relaxed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It aggravates Agatha even more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want to take control over </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> investigation?” She asks in disbelief. The </span>
<em>
<span>nerve </span>
</em>
<span>on this woman was beyond her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, Agatha. If you want to be in control, you can be.” Rio reassures nonchalantly, but Agatha notices the grin she was desperately trying to suppress. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a second, her mind freezes, almost forgetting </span>
<em>
<span>where </span>
</em>
<span>they are and </span>
<em>
<span>what </span>
</em>
<span>she’s doing at this moment - her thoughts momentarily occupied by memories from this weekend of when she </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> in total control.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She quickly snaps out of it, however, when realizing that everyone in the room still has their eyes on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was actively trying to rile her up, she knew that, she wanted a reaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But instead, Agatha takes a deep breath, feigning an apathetic expression, “Fine, pick a team to investigate the assassination in Somerville. If you find anything, I want you to bring it directly to my office - no middle man.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nods.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Understood, Vidal?” She asks sternly. She knew Rio did, but she wanted the playing field even. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nods again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, wanting to say, ‘</span>
<em>
<span>no snark remark</span>
</em>
<span>?’ so desperately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turns around, starting to erase the damage she’s done with her horrible writing on the board. “You’re dismissed,” she calls over her shoulder to the team, “I’ll be in my office if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With that, she promptly leaves the room, a red folder tucked under her arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without even a second to breathe, she notices Rio following her into her office. Once they’re inside, Agatha closes the door dramatically, almost feeling the walls shake from the action.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the hell are you doing Rio?” She asks, sitting down with her head in her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t flinch, simply watching her from across the desk, “I was gonna tell you who I want on my field team.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t mean what you’re doing </span>
<em>
<span>in here</span>
</em>
<span>.” Agatha groans, “I mean what you did during the meeting. Do you </span>
<em>
<span>want </span>
</em>
<span>the other’s to find out? Is that your end goal with this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I already told you that I don’t care if they find out,” Rio dead-pans, moving to sit down on the desk, giving no option for personal space. “But </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span>, if they find out, that’ll be your fault entirely. I won’t say anything, I told you that as well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs in disbelief, “You’re the one actively trying to rile me up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, “Maybe, but you’re the one throwing a fit about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not throwing a-” Agatha turns away, looking out the window to desperately gather her thoughts. “You can’t expect me to act normal when you say stuff like that in front of everyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio raises her eyebrows teasingly, “Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs, averting her eyes from the city view, glaring into Rio’s eyes, “You’re a walking reminder, do you have to be a talking one too?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirks, “Oh, but I think you like it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To be reminded.” Rio answers, a glint in her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, without another word, presses a paper to Rio’s chest, “Be sure to bring that report back to me as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snaps the paper out of her hand and stands up, “Te veo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio’s out the door, Agatha groans again, throws her head back and closes her eyes, breathing heavily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knew Rio was trying to rile her up, and she was so desperate to ignore it, to not let the words affect her. She hated what Rio was doing--</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she hated even more that she didn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not entirely, at least. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was a fun game, a back-and-forth of which Agatha could feel herself getting addicted. It was dangerous; on the verge of discovery from the others. But that made the thrill of it even more exciting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She would never admit that to Rio, though. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hell, she even has trouble admitting it to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>_______</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the week had been calmer, at least in that aspect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had been out of the office on field investigations every day since Monday, it was already Thursday. Which made the teasing die down, and Agatha didn’t know if she was thankful or annoyed because of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On the surface, she felt more relaxed. Able to walk around the office, back straight, once again feeling like she owned the place in a way she couldn’t when Rio was around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Which became even more noticeable when Rio walked into the office during Thursday’s lunch hour. A proud smile on her face as she, Jen and Alice walk into the conference room, where the others were having lunch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We figured it out.” She smiles, walking over to Agatha and placing a thick pile of papers on the table in front of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She drags out a chair, sitting down beside Agatha, once again ignoring every idea of personal space there is.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s this?” Agatha asks, placing down her fork to start browsing the pages.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s proof.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looks up, exasperated, “Proof for </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glares at her, face </span>
<em>
<span>way </span>
</em>
<span>too close for comfort, “That the motherfucker is responsible for everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raises her eyebrows, amazed, “How did you get it?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, “I have my ways.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, looking down at the paper, suddenly painfully aware of everyone else in the room. They weren’t paying attention to them, specifically, too caught up in whatever story Alice and Jen were laying out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Apparently, Rio had realized this as well, because a second later Agatha feels a hand starting to massage her shoulders. Focusing on a spot by her shoulder blade where Rio had detected a muscle knot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha closes her eyes and bites her lip, trying to stifle a moan that threatens to escape her thanks to Rio’s gentle but strong touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wants to be mad, to turn around and glare at Rio so she would stop, to warn her that the others are in the room. But the pleasure of the tension in her shoulder releasing is consuming, erasing all possibility for her to even think straight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We should celebrate!” Jen exclaims, “Who wants to grab a couple of drinks tomorrow night?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha can feel Rio’s hand quickly retracting. A bit disoriented, she looks up before processing Jen’s words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sounds great!” Billy says enthusiastically</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, “I don’t know… I might have plans tomorrow night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffs, turning her attention to Jen, “I’m game.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stands up without another word, quickly gathering her lunch box before walking out, not staying to hear them comment on her sudden outburst. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stomps into her own office and slams the door behind her, sitting down by her desk to finish her lunch in silence - groaning in frustration when she reaches for her fork only to realize she forgot it in the other room</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A second later, Rio opens the door, “You should learn to control your anger better.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glares at her, annoyed, “You shouldn’t meddle in other people’s business.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, “Why won’t you join the team tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As I said, I might have plans.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The grin that spreads across Rio’s face at that is nothing but pure amusement, “With who?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>thought </span>
</em>
<span>you might be able to take a hint.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Realization hits Rio’s eyes like a freight train, “</span>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>! You meant me didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha has to fight against the urge to roll her eyes. “Forget it,” she mumbles instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio walks over slowly, Agatha is </span>
<em>
<span>sure </span>
</em>
<span>she puts more effort into swaying her hips than usual, “You could’ve just said so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I said forget it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs again, “I can cancel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha scoffs, “You go have fun with the others.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Join us?” Rio pleads, sitting down on the desk in front of Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha squirms in her seat, wanting, but unable to say no to Rio when she looks at her like </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I already told the others I have plans.” She says instead, trying to get smoothly out of the situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So? Tell them your plans have changed.” Rio suggests.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once again, Agatha has an internal debate with herself.. She wants desperately to go because Rio will be there - but she also wants to stand her ground and maybe even persuade Rio to </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>go, instead. But she recognizes that suggesting that would be deeply selfish of her to do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” she mumbles eventually, “I can join you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pleased facial expression Rio makes at that is enough for any doubt to disappear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stands up promptly, trying to keep a straight face, “I’m just gonna tell the team about my </span>
<em>
<span>change of plans</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaves her office door open behind her as a silent request for Rio to walk out, maybe go to her own desk. But Agatha should’ve known better, she knows so herself - Rio follows suit with eager steps behind her back into the conference room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve changed my mind.” Agatha says sternly once she reaches the doorway, “I’ll join you tomorrow.” Without any desire for a snide remark, she quickly walks in to grab her fork and the pile of papers Rio had placed on the table earlier.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No way! Rio, how did you convince her?” Jen asks, sarcastically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha halts for a second, “She didn’t-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“With my good looks, I presume,” Rio interrupts, winking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could kill her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With hurried steps she leaves the room, not wanting to face whatever aftermath could come after </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>statement. Behind her she hears Jen and Lilia laugh, causing Agatha to calm down for a second. At least they thought it was a joke, </span>
<em>
<span>right</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t leave her office for the rest of the afternoon, skimming through the pages of the report Rio had given her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was highly impressed by the work Rio had done together with Jen and Alice. It was a good report, evidence carefully laid out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The man </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>responsible for at least one of the assassinations, and his associates they had talked too in the field had been stupid enough to give away where he was hiding out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She would be even prouder of Rio’s work if it wasn’t clouded by the annoyance she felt at that moment. She needed her to be more subtle, but she also couldn’t call it off. She’d found herself a little </span>
<em>
<span>too </span>
</em>
<span>comfortable in their agreement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And once again, it was the factor of their constant pull-and-push. The addicting game that had been established between them. Even though Agatha hated it for the most part, she also thrived in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t even flinch when she hears the door to her office open, knowing already who would be annoying enough to disturb her right now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you gonna sulk in here for the rest of the day?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t look up from the papers. “You did a great job solving the case, Vidal,” she says, trying to smoothly change the subject.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffs, “You know praise-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Don’t</span>
</em>
<span> finish that sentence,” Agatha interrupts, raising her hand in a shush.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shrugging, Rio sits down in her self-assigned seat she’d placed by the desk across from Agatha. “It’s getting late, the case is closed,” She sighs. “Go home, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don't you tell me what to do,” Agatha mutters under her breath. However, she lets herself be persuaded by Rio’s words, standing up and starting to gather her things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know they thought it was a joke, right?” Rio asks, standing up as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yet it was reckless of you to say such a thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gets a panicked expression, “You’re not genuinely mad, are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha desperately wants to keep the stone face, to not break the mad facade. But she also folds way too quickly in Rio’s presence, a smirk escaping the corners of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sees this, and suddenly the mood changes, “Can I make it up to you?” She asks, seductively biting her lip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A million different scenarios flash in front of Agatha’s eyes. The answer to that was </span>
<em>
<span>yes</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio could make it up to her very easily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” she says instead, putting on her black scarf in a practiced manner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moves teasingly close, their bodies mere inches apart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha warns.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhm?” Rio hums, eyes flickering between Agatha’s lips and eyes - like she has trouble choosing what to focus on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha places her palm on Rio’s chest, having to physically hinder herself from doing anything. “Not at the office,” she whispers weakly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re the only ones left,” Rio sighs before taking a step back, “But okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breathes out slowly, having to refocus herself back to reality. She was thankful Rio let her go the second she did, but also disappointed - almost hoping Rio would be more resilient.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She says goodbye with a single nod before walking out, not another word exchanged between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>______</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha realizes that agreeing to go was a mistake the </span>
<em>
<span>second </span>
</em>
<span>she walks into the bar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not only was it yet another situation where she needed to socialize, but she needed to do it in close proximity with Rio-- while being drunk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knew she inflicted this situation on herself, she didn’t have any obligation to agree to join them here at this crowded bar with music that was </span>
<em>
<span>way </span>
</em>
<span>too loud. She needed to flip the situation and blame it on Rio, somehow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, who had been close to outing them more than once this week alone, was a dangerous player in their game, and Agatha knew it wouldn’t be easier to keep her quiet when intoxicated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha spots Lilia and Billy by a table, for </span>
<em>
<span>once </span>
</em>
<span>not being the first to arrive. She joins them, sitting down awkwardly, feeling very out of place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Glad you decided to join us,” Billy says, enthusiastically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How he could always be so enthusiastic was beyond her, but she smiles politely in response - not bothered, and too stressed, to answer him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do we know when the others will be arriving?” Lilia asks, apparently already been here long enough to order a glass of white wine, as she fidgets with it, swirling the drink around in the glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna go get a drink,” Agatha states, leaving her coat behind before standing up and walking over to the bar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She waits impatiently for the bartender, drumming her fingertips against the marble counter as she watches him work on a few drinks before turning his attention to her, “One glass of red please-- most expensive you got.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bartender smiles courteously, “Coming right up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nods appreciatively, standing with one arm resting on the bar, scanning the room with her eyes for anything to entertain her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sees Rio walk in, looking a little lost before spotting Billy and Lilia in their booth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her heart sinks for a moment - she can’t tell whether it’s due to excitement or anxiety, or both.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looks beautiful as she moves across the space, her hair down and a nice black blouse that exposes her shoulders, carefully hugging her features underneath her coat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Almost too caught up in watching Rio, she almost doesn’t realize the glass being placed in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She walks back to their table, glass in hand, and carefully places it on the table before sitting down across from Rio in the booth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>The first notion that something is off</span> <span>comes right then. </span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t waver, she doesn’t even seem to realize Agatha had just joined them as she talks to Lilia - fully engaged in a conversation about Boston traffic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few weeks ago, this wouldn’t bother Agatha at all. But she didn’t even get a single nod, not a smile, not even a momentarily look her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It catches Agatha completely off guard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Choosing to ignore it, she instead sips on her wine, downing way too much in one go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice walk in a few minutes later. “Hello guys,” Jen greets when they reach their table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looks up at them. “Hello,” she says, a warm smile on her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It pisses Agatha off. She stands up, finishing the rest of her glass in one swell swoop. “I’m gonna order another one, does anyone want anything from the bar?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tries desperately to ignore Rio’s eyes on her in that second-- the underlying </span>
<em>
<span>worry</span>
</em>
<span> that could be detected in the depths of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m good,” Rio smiles with the same, polite indifference she’d offered Jen and Alice mere seconds ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When a collective ‘no,’ could be heard, Agatha turns on her heels in fury. Desperate to get away, she storms across the bar.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>The bartender recognizes her immediately, holding up a finger as if to say ‘</span><em><span>wait</span></em><span>’</span> <span>before simply, without a word, bringing her a new glass of the same wine. </span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha walks back to their table to sit down beside Alice this time. The group is already deep in a discussion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sits in silence, watching everyone, relaxing back onto the cushions behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, Rio is the one her eyes keep going back to. She still doesn’t have a drink, simply fidgeting with her rings as she’s talking to the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha can’t help but to feel it sting inside of her, not because Rio wasn’t talking to her, but because Rio didn’t seem to pay her any mind </span>
<em>
<span>at all</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she walked back to the table she thought Rio would at least give her a glance, or acknowledge her presence-- but no. Agatha had never felt more invisible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What she hated even more is that she had no reasonable explanation for Rio’s behavior. Agatha hadn’t said something, she hadn’t been rejecting Rio throughout the week. She did prevent a kiss from happening yesterday, but that had been reasonable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If anything, she’d done the opposite. Everytime Rio would flirt with her she placed gentle hints and small, teasing, remarks back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Angelica asked about you yesterday, by the way.” Jen says, looking at Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s ears perk up, honestly quite interested in </span>
<em>
<span>what </span>
</em>
<span>that idiot had said now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow, “Oh, what did she ask about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She was just talking about your date, and how abruptly you left. You definitely don’t know how to make a girl feel special,” Jen says, laughing.</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, ‘</span>
<em>
<span>yes she does</span>
</em>
<span>’ she thinks to herself. But she stays quiet, interested in where this conversation could possibly go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told you, I was very tired that night,” Rio explains matter-of-factly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So I should tell her you’re interested in another date? She’d be over the moon!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, </span>
<em>
<span>of course </span>
</em>
<span>Rio wouldn’t be interested. Angelica was a bland, boring person lacking any real personality. Rio deserved someone so much better. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t even inherently mean herself. </span>
<em>
<span>Anyone </span>
</em>
<span>but Angelica would do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, “I don’t know Jen. I wouldn’t want to lead her on or something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then make that clear. It’s not like you’re seeing anyone else, what harm would it do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tenses up at that question. Because the answer is </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio is not seeing anyone. They both agreed to the terms of </span>
<em>
<span>casual </span>
</em>
<span>sex, or in Rio’s own words “fuck buddies”. They are allowed to see other people, Agatha shouldn’t be mad over that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha wasn’t a relationship person, she mainly went on dates to have sex. And now, when that spot had been filled, it’s not like she was in a dire need to go on a date anymore. But on the other hand, she didn’t know Rio that well, maybe Rio </span>
<em>
<span>wanted </span>
</em>
<span>the relationship part, and Agatha was just a momentary thing until she found someone? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll think about it,” Rio says with a fabricated smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly stands up and walks over to the bar to get another glass of wine. She’s gonna need </span>
<em>
<span>a lot </span>
</em>
<span>of alcohol to handle this evening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she’s back by the table she realizes, to her relief, that the conversation topic had been changed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alice, when did you get that tattoo? I’ve never noticed it before,” Billy asks, looking pointedly at a tattoo of runes on Alice’s arm, barely visible as her shirt covers half of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My mom made me get it, she believes in witchcraft and stuff - we have matching ones,” Alice explains, rolling up her sleeve and showing it to the group.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everyone, except Agatha, leans in, studying the tattoo. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve got a tattoo,” Rio says, suddenly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No you don’t,” Agatha mumbles without a second thought. Because no she didn’t? She would’ve seen it, </span>
<em>
<span>right</span>
</em>
<span>?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The way the rest of the group turns to look at her in confusion is what regrounds her in reality-- </span>
<em>
<span>She said that out loud</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To get away from everyone’s stares, she looks down at her glass, suddenly very interested in the color of her wine. But she could still see the visible smirk on Rio’s face from the corner of her eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would you know that?” Billy asks, mostly out of confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, why </span>
<em>
<span>would </span>
</em>
<span>you know that?” Rio teases.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, taking a sip of her wine, “I mean… R- Vidal doesn’t seem like a person with tattoos,” she tries, punching herself mentally for the stupid excuse. “Am I wrong?” She asks desperately, looking around to find some agreement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everyone ignores her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Show us the tattoo then, Rio.” Billy suggests, nudging her in the side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk grows impossibly wide, “Impossible… unless you want me naked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where is it?” Lilia asks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lower back, by my hip,” Rio describes, dragging her finger down to where the tattoo was allegedly placed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha follows her movement in confusion, she was </span>
<em>
<span>sure </span>
</em>
<span>she would’ve noticed if Rio had a tattoo there, “What is it of?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looks up at her, and their eyes meet for the first time in what feels like </span>
<em>
<span>hours,</span>
</em>
<span> “Secret.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A shiver runs down Agatha’s spine, but she ignores the sensation, taking another sip of her wine, fidgeting with the foot of the glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio is the first to break eye contact, looking over at Alice, “Tell us more about your tattoo though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice shrugs, “Honestly, I don’t know much more. She wanted it, and told me to get the same one. Apparently it wards of curses?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy leans in, looking at it more thoroughly, “Yeah, I think so.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re into witchcraft?” Alice asks, shocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was, when I was a teenager, you know.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, </span>
<em>
<span>of course he was</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looks over at Rio, noticing the empty space on the table in front of her, “You’re not drinking?” She asks, nudging on Rio’s leg under the table to gain her attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what I want yet,” She says dismissively, not allowing for further conversation as she quickly looks away again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha is left even more confused than earlier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why </span>
</em>
<span>would Rio ignore her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s at the point where the annoyance turns into aggravation - almost something like desperation. She needed to find out </span>
<em>
<span>what the fuck </span>
</em>
<span>she did to deserve this treatment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was always on the verge between flirting dangerously</span>
<em>
<span> too much</span>
</em>
<span> in the company of the others, and now she just… doesn’t? Not even a little?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha knew that she should be grateful. But the alcohol had already entered her system, affecting the ability to control her emotions. So ignoring the situation, which she </span>
<em>
<span>would </span>
</em>
<span>do normally, was suddenly off the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Unsure of whether or not to grab another drink, she instead decides to clear her thoughts outside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Excusing herself, she grabs her purse and bag and is quickly outside of the bar, lighting the cigarette - hands already shaking from the cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looks around at the people in their 20s, standing with their friends, feeling oddly out of place. A girl asks for a lighter which she reluctantly gives her, standing and watching as she lights a cigarette with a bit of a struggle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckles, mostly out of annoyance, almost wanting to grab the lighter and light it for her - patience almost completely nonexistent in this moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s ignoring, the weird conversation about tattoos, her freudian slip-- it was all too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eventually, she throws the cigarette butt angrily on the ground and stomps inside. Opening the door a bit too aggressively, she earns a couple of side-looks from the people sitting inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stomps through the bar, sitting down with a heavy sigh in her seat beside Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Since when are you an avid smoker?” Alice asks, noticing the apparent smell coming off of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs, waving her hands dismissively, “I’m not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She can hear Rio chuckle from the other side of the table, so she looks over. Rio now has a drink placed to her lips, sipping from it attentively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice holds her hands up in defeat beside her, “Okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, debating heavily on whether or not to get a tequila.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t have to debate for long. “Anyone up for a round of shots?” Jen asks enthusiastically, like she read her thoughts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Rio answers, placing down her drink on the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If it’s tequila,” Agatha says, her eyes still not leaving Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What the hell happened when she was outside? What made Rio change her mind so drastically? She can’t help but let a little confusion slip through her facial expression, looking at Rio with concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t meet her gaze, still focused entirely on Jen as she stands up to walk over to the bar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha straightens her back, drinking the last drops of wine left at the bottom of her glass and placing it down a bit too harshly - earning yet another couple of side glances from the people around her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everyone, except Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s starting to piss her off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, it has been pissing her off for quite a while now. But she quickly decides that she needs to do something drastic to earn her attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen returns a few minutes later, balancing five tequila shots together with lime and salt on a silver tray. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha takes the salt, licking a stripe up her hand languidly, still trying to make eye contact with Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Jen asks, lime in one hand and shot glass in the other, looking around the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha places the lime between thumb and pointer finger, nodding sharply as she swallows in preparation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One,” Billy begins to count them down, “Two, Three.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tequila hits Agatha’s throat with a burning sensation before she takes the lime into her mouth, sucking on it with something dangerously close to a moan as the sour taste runs down her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She closes her eyes for a second, letting the warmth of the drink run through her system.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Opening them, her eyes immediately on Rio again, she was like gravity. Rio was laughing, although it was muffled by the lime still pressed between her lips, as she was sucking the remaining juices of lime into her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A string of saliva runs down her chin, but Rio is quick to wipe it off with the bottom of her sleeve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A shiver runs down Agatha’s spine at the sight. </span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cursing herself out, she looks away, focusing her attention on a group of people at the back of the bar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It’s useless. Thoughts of Rio are still clouding her brain. In desperation, she clears her throat, “I need to go to the toilet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Standing up, she grabs her bag and quickly walks through the bar, having to force her way through a group of young guys in her way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Since this is a relatively small bar, there was only one women’s toilet. Groaning, she reluctantly walks over to the queue that had formed outside of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She picks up her phone, scrolling mindlessly while waiting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great save back there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t look up - she doesn't have to, knowing exactly who that voice belongs to, almost too well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You don’t have a tattoo.</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio mocks, laughing lightly, “So much for keeping a secret.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “Like you’ve been better, you mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Rio smirks, taking a step back when a woman walks past them out of the bathroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moves up the queue, now next in line. “Whatever,” she snorts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stand in silence for a while.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, what the fuck is up with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looks at her, confused, “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re always talking, annoyingly so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio feigns an offended expression, “Ouch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looks away, keeping her eyes focused on the wall in front of her, “</span>
<em>
<span>And </span>
</em>
<span>you’ve been ignoring me all night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I haven’t been igno-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s interrupted by the door opening, a young girl walking out, giving them a small smile before walking past.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes. “We’re sorting this out,” she says, grabbing Rio’s wrist and dragging her into the bathroom, “now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now? What did I even do?” Rio asks confused, walking over to lean herself against the sink, flinching a little when Agatha slams the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know you’re not </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> stupid,” Agatha says sternly, closing the distance between them, only stopping when they’re standing dangerously close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grins, “You’re the one who told me to be more careful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “Ignoring me isn’t being careful. That’s being </span>
<em>
<span>more </span>
</em>
<span>obvious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just admit it,” Rio smirks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Admit what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You liked the teasing,” Rio states, leaning forwards only enough so her breath would ghost Agatha’s skin with every word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh shut up,” Agatha sneers, but still not taking a step back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How about you make me?” Rio teases.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, “Oh sweetheart,” she leans in, lips brushing on Rio’s lips. “You think ignoring me the entire night is gonna lead you anywhere?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitches, “I haven’t been-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs mockingly in her ear, “You haven’t?” She places her hand on the back of Rio’s throat, “You’re a terrible liar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A shiver runs down Rio’s spine. “You chose the wrong person to keep a secret with, then,” She says, breathlessly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips start moving teasingly light against the skin under her ear. “</span>
<em>
<span>I know</span>
</em>
<span>,” she whispers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So it’s just because I’m irresistible then?” Rio teases, grinning lighty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Agatha purrs against her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Make-”</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t get to finish that sentancebefore Agatha furiously presses her lips against hers, vigorously adding tongue mere seconds later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They move against each other rhythmically, anger mixed with desire. Rio lets out an involuntary moan when Agatha places her lip between her teeth, biting gently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grins, placing her hands underneath Rio’s legs to lift her up to sit beside the sink, standing in between her legs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She places one hand on the back of Rio’s neck, a finger tangling in her hair, while the other slowly moves down her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Never breaking the kiss, she hurriedly moves to unbutton Rio’s jeans. She reaches down with one finger, brushing against the fabric of her underwear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Already wet?” She mumbles against her lips, “Pathetic, really.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio whimpers, grinding down on her fingers desperately, causing Agatha to swiftly remove her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Acting like a </span>
<em>
<span>brat</span>
</em>
<span>, and then thinking I’m gonna help get you off? You’re smarter than that, Vidal,” She says warningly, pulling away from the kiss entirely to watch the disappointment on Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She smirks, taking a step back before helping Rio get down. She sees Rio’s legs wobble as they hit the floor, tilting her head in mock concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looks at her, almost beggingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Whatever, suit yourself,” She says, forcing Rio’s legs apart with her knee, applying pressure on Rio’s cunt with her thigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio parts her mouth in shock, and Agatha seizes the opportunity to kiss her again, moving her tongue expertly into her mouth while pressing her thigh up, adding even more pressure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha keeps her leg there, knee pressed to the sink for stability, but not making a single effort to move herself - Rio would need to work for it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she did. Within seconds, Rio starts to grind herself down on her thigh in rhythm with the kiss’ rapid movements. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breaks away, instead kissing down the side of Rio’s neck, keeping her hands on the counter by the sink, gripping the edges so tight her knuckles go white in an effort to </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>touch Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha lightly nibs at her pulse point, she earns an audible moan from Rio. Breaking away entirely, she looks deeply into Rio’s eyes, “We’re still in a public bathroom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nods, realizing her mistake and quickly presses her face down on Agatha’s shoulder in an effort to suppress her moans. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly gets lost in the scent of Rio’s hair that’s stroking the side of her face. Rio bites down on her shoulder when Agatha’s thigh presses against her clit </span>
<em>
<span>just right</span>
</em>
<span> - Forcing Agatha to desperately stifle a whimper that threatens to escape her at the contact. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio continues her eager movements against her thigh. Grinding at an angle she knows would work to stimulate her needs. Agatha can tell she is close to the edge by the way her body starts to squirm, her movements starting to become more ragged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Deciding to be helpful, Agatha brings her hands to Rio’s hips, nails almost tearing the fabric due to the strong grip she holds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, in response, starts moving her hands over Agatha’s stomach. From the outline of her breasts underneath her bra, down to the waistline of her pants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulls away entirely. Her mouth leaving the crook of her neck as she simultaneously retreats her hands from Rio’s hips - gripping the table behind once again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In response, Rio groans in frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tsks, entertained by the desperate look in Rio’s eyes. “Hands to yourself,” she demands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Reluctantly, Rio removes her hands from Agatha’s body, gripping the edge of the counter behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha removes a strand of hair by Rio’s ear. “Good girl,” She whispers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And those words are, embarrassingly enough, what pushes Rio over the edge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her entire body trembles against Agatha as she tries to stay silent through her orgasm - hips no longer able to move as her legs weaken beneath her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, looking down at Rio who’s out of breath, looking almost helpless as she desperately grinds out the last of her climax. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her pupils are dilated from the pleasure, a red tint visible in her cheeks. The sight makes heat pool at the bottom of Agatha’s stomach, feeling herself getting wet against her underwear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leans in and gives a quick, reassuring kiss on Rio’s lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good job,” She mumbles, lips grazing lightly against Rio’s.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stand in silence for a while as Rio comes down from her high - Agatha’s thigh still supporting most of her weight.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leans in again to steal a quick kiss on Rio’s swollen, red lips. “We need to get out of here, though,” she mumbles, almost inaudibly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallows but nods, almost losing her balance entirely when Agatha removes her leg from in between her thighs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Give me a second,” She practically begs, turning around to look at herself in the mirror.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha takes a few steps back and leans against the red tiled wall behind her as she watches Rio through the mirror, a faint smile on her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So it worked?” Rio asks suddenly, looking at Agatha through the mirror as she applies lipstick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To make you fuck me.” Rio explains bluntly, smacking her lips together and turning around, leaning against the counter, “Ignoring you, it works?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grins, “I didn’t fuck you… And </span>
<em>
<span>don’t</span>
</em>
<span> try it again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So pissing you off, then?” Rio teases, walking past Agatha and opening the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without another word, Rio closes the bathroom door again, leaving Agatha in disbelief in the silence of the small room.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She takes a few deep breaths to calm herself before locking the door and walking over to the mirror, placing down her bag on the counter. She knew she needed to kill some time before walking back to the table - or else questions would be raised on </span>
<em>
<span>why the hell </span>
</em>
<span>they went to the toilet together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Groaning in frustration, she runs her fingers through her hair, trying to untangle the mess Rio had made. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>knew </span>
</em>
<span>Rio had been actively trying to piss her off, but hearing her admit it put another light on the situation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had to admit that it was kinda hot. The entire back-and-forth eventually leading to an angry make out session in a club bathroom was thrilling-- intoxicating even.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Knowing that Rio played by those rules as well was… </span>
<em>
<span>interesting</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it also pissed her off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even if she wanted those heated moments, having Rio ignore her the entire night had actually put her on edge. But she would never admit that to Rio.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because saying that she actually cared about Rio, more than whatever just went down in the bathroom, would be to admit something she, herself, was still denying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That she was in constant need of Rio’s approval. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not because she needed her validation. Mainly, she was scared of what Rio could do </span>
<em>
<span>if </span>
</em>
<span>she lost interest. Not only could she go around and tell everyone, her leaving would also greatly affect Agatha’s own self-esteem.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt vulnerable in the presence of Rio - who was holding Agatha’s entire reputation in the palm of her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With one sentence, Rio had the power to destroy it, to taint her entire work with a layer of unprofessionalism. Agatha hated herself for allowing that to happen, but she couldn’t help it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because, aside from feeling vulnerable - being in the presence of Rio made her feel powerful and desired. </span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could send Rio squirming and coming undone underneath her with simple words. Demand almost anything, and Rio would comply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Rio </span>
<em>
<span>wanted </span>
</em>
<span>her - she wanted her gentle touch as much as the rough. She craved moments like this in the bathroom, just as much as Agatha did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had become an addict to the addiction that was </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>. The constant push-and-pull, the teasing, the flirting, the remarks - everything had led up to this moment. Agatha thrived in it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sighing, she walks out of the bathroom, earning a snide look from one of the women in the queue who probably had heard the entire exchange. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But in the midst of her high, she can’t find it in herself to feel any shame - walking past the queue with her head held high, a confidence in her step as her heels clap against the bar floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she gets back to the table, Rio is already in a deep conversation with Alice. The contrast in her demeanor, compared to mere minutes ago, made a smug smirk appear on Agatha’s face as she sits down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She catches Rio looking at her, causing something in her stomach to flutter as she quickly looks away - a blush creeping up beneath the hem of her shirt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This entire situation felt surreal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Teasingly, she drags her foot against Rio’s leg, lifting up a bit of fabric from her flared jeans.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glares daggers at her in response.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tension between them is palpable. For a second, Agatha’s even afraid that Billy caught up on it, when she saw him looking suspiciously between the both of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She decides to brush the thought off. Billy wasn’t clever enough to figure it out, and it could just be his normal digging, always meddling in other people’s business.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, debating whether or not to get up and leave and somehow bring Rio home with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She realizes soon enough that it would be impossible. There was no way she could get her alone again, the others would instantly figure out that there’s </span>
<em>
<span>something </span>
</em>
<span>going on. Especially after their stunt of going to, and staying in, the bathroom for way too long together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later that night, she calls an uber - not drunk enough to walk home in the creeping cold October air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Disappointingly enough, she never got to ask Rio if she wanted to spend the night at her place. Never finding the right opportunity to - it was like the others had made it their life’s mission to never let them have a moment alone together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio climbs in an uber with Jen, whom she apparently lived close to, she can see the apologetic, and almost disappointed look in her eyes as she waves goodbye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was disappointed as well. But they needed to be professional, to edge around this carefully. Rio did what she thought would be the best option for keeping their secret, and Agatha was deeply grateful for it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, the bathroom exchange was still heavily engraved in her mind. The lingering feeling of Rio grinding against her thigh, moaning against her shoulder and the way she could still taste her, was enough to send her down a spiral as she was sitting in the uber on the way home.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her thighs clench together when she can practically hear the moan Rio had let out as she came undone. She looks up at the ceiling of the car, trying to calm herself with a few deep breaths - but everything serves as a reminder of Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That night, Agatha comes around her own fingers, screaming Rio’s name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>_______</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Monday at the office was a slow affair. Their team had yet to be assigned a new case, so Agatha mostly sat in her office the entire day, reading and answering emails half-heartedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Completely zoned out, she almost doesn’t hear the knock on her door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolls her eyes, standing up to open it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It couldn’t possibly be Rio, she never knocked, walking through the door like she owned the place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, she sees Billy standing outside, back straight in a way that makes his confidence look fake. Like he’s trying to overcompensate for something else - </span>
<em>
<span>nervousness</span>
</em>
<span>, maybe?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” She asks dismissively, wanting him out of her sight as soon as possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He clears his throat, “Can I come in?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She takes a step back, letting him in without a word, before closing the door after him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The complete silence that follows puts her on edge. She walks past Billy to sit in her chair, trying to ease the tension a bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So?” She says, drumming her fingers impatiently on the wooden desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a moment of silence that drags out for </span>
<em>
<span>way </span>
</em>
<span>too long in Agatha’s opinion, Billy takes a deep breath like he has to prepare himself for what he’s about to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s going on between you and Rio?”</span>

<em> “What’s going on between you and Rio?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The words hit her like a freight train. </p><p> </p><p>“Vidal?” Agatha asks, trying to sound indifferent, “What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy shrugs, “I know something happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at him in fury, “What makes you even suggest such a thing?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio came out of the bathroom this friday with a hickey on her neck,” Billy explains with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>For a second, the wind is knocked out of Agatha’s lungs. She had been careful not to leave a mark anywhere, and she <em> certainly </em>would’ve noticed herself if there actually had been a hickey, wouldn’t she?.</p><p> </p><p>“She did?” Agatha asks, biting her lip to stop herself from saying anything that would expose her further.</p><p> </p><p>Billy rolls his eyes, sitting down at the chair on the other side of the desk. ‘<em>Rio’s chair </em>,’ Agatha thinks bitterly. </p><p> </p><p>“Just tell me,” Billy leans forward, “I won’t judge.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I certainly didn’t put any clumsy glamor on her - what she does in her spare time is none of my business.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy gives her a skeptical look, “So I’m also supposed to ignore the changed dynamic between you two?”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha wants to claw his eyes out.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been acting… different. I mean, Rio certainly has been flirting with you more than she used to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, “Well, <em> that </em>, you have to bring up with her.”</p><p> </p><p>“So, you’re telling me that nothing is going on between you two?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes I am,” Agatha says sternly, promptly standing up. “And questioning this is questioning my professionality, and in extent, my position. I could have you fired for even suggesting this.”</p><p> </p><p>She, frankly, had no idea if she had the power to fire Billy. If she did, she certainly would sooner or later - the child had been getting on her nerves lately. Today didn’t help his case, either.</p><p> </p><p>Walking towards the door, she flings it open dramatically, using her body weight to keep it open, “Get out.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy scrambles to gather himself, standing up and hurrying out the door without a single word.</p><p> </p><p><em> This </em>was the power Agatha loved. She could make annoying co-workers tense and run away from her like scared little children. It put a smile on her face, genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>She closes the door with a deep exhale, trying to regain her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Billy had seen an alleged hickey on Rio’s neck? A hickey Agatha had so carelessly <em> accidentally </em>put there. Oh, she wanted to kill herself for it.</p><p> </p><p>She knew she needed to somehow converse with Rio about this. To tell her what Billy had seen, what he’d caught up on - and possibly, what he’d told others.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to scream, to run around or to hit something out of pure frustration. She needed to slam multiple plates on the ground, to hear them break into a million pieces.</p><p> </p><p>Pulling her hair in frustration, she sits down in her chair to reground herself.</p><p> </p><p>The sun had started to set outside the window, and for the first time in a <em> long time</em>, Agatha decided to leave the office before 4 pm.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a liberating decision in any capacity. More so a cageing one. She hated being home, alone with her own thoughts. But also, she couldn’t stand being in here right now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still sitting at her desk, reading something on her computer when Agatha walked past.</p><p> </p><p>If Billy hadn’t called her out on her escapades with Rio mere minutes earlier, Agatha would’ve probably offered at least a smile Rio’s way.</p><p> </p><p>But she couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Billy was right there, and suddenly, Agatha felt as if he was monitoring her every move.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, apparently, caught on too her weird behavior. Because seconds later, when Agatha’s standing by the elevator, she can feel Rio’s presence closing in behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Having left in a hurry, Rio was still struggling to get her coat on. “Leaving early?” She says, teasingly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels the air get stuck inside her, unable to respond. Anxiety was crashing over her like a tidal wave - she couldn’t be seen in so close proximity with Rio. Not now.</p><p> </p><p>Who else had seen that hickey on her neck?</p><p> </p><p>The thought stressed her out, even more so as she entered the elevator. The air started to thicken around her, making it harder to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>In an attempt to calm down, she tightly gripped the railing, looking up at the ceiling to avoid the unignorable presence of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“What is going on, Agatha?” Rio asks eventually, once when the elevator reached the ground floor and they walked out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waves her hand dismissively, trying to shake Rio off. It’s futile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio catches up to her, blocking her right by the entrance. Agatha looks at her in despair, still not saying anything. Not sure on how to formulate the words.</p><p> </p><p>They needed to stop seeing each other.</p><p> </p><p>It had barely been a week, and they’d been busted. Who knows what could happen a week from now. Agatha certainly didn’t want to find out.</p><p> </p><p>“We can’t…” Agatha takes a deep breath, bracing for impact, “see each other … anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s facial expression becomes blank. She flicks her gaze between Agatha’s eyes, like she was trying to detect a lie.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a lie.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” She asks, confused, struggling to put the puzzle pieces together.</p><p> </p><p>“Because Billy found out,” Agatha blurts out. She uses Rio’s state of shock to push past her, opening the glass door and walking out.</p><p> </p><p>Finally getting fresh air, Agatha involuntarily halts for a second, breathing in deeply.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean Billy found out?” Rio asks, a slight panic in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns around, almost body slamming into Rio. “I accidentally gave you a hickey,” she says sharply before turning abruptly on her heel again and reaching out her hand to call for an empty cab.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands frozen for a second, “He saw it?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises her eyebrows, “You <em> knew</em>?” </p><p> </p><p>“Of course I knew, I saw it in the mirror,” Rio says, rolling her eyes. “But it was behind my ear, I didn’t think anyone would see it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, getting into the yellow car that had parked in front of her. She needed away from this conversation, away from the office and away from Rio. As soon as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had other plans however, because a second later, she joins Agatha in the backseat.</p><p> </p><p>“You think I’m gonna let you leave before we’ve talked things through?” Rio says in disbelief, “We’re both adults here, we can have a civil conversation.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans and looks out the window. The last thing she wanted right now was a conversation. Now, she would prefer a bottle of wine and some lazy-watching tv, but Rio was a professional at fucking up her plans. </p><p> </p><p>Since Agatha’s too stubborn to say anything, and Rio’s angry enough that she isn’t - the entire car ride is spent in complete silence. With exception for the low music coming from the radio, which really didn’t fit the mood.</p><p> </p><p>When she can feel the car come to a halt, Agatha’s quickly out, walking over to the entrance of her apartment complex. Rio follows suit, just a few footsteps behind.</p><p> </p><p>Her unrelenting demeanor was slowly crawling its way up Agatha’s skin. Annoyance filling her as they stand in silence in the elevator, the tension strong enough that it could be felt brushing against their skin.</p><p> </p><p>The rattling of the keys is the only sound echoing through the stairwell when Agatha opens the door.</p><p> </p><p>For the first few seconds after they entered the apartment, the silence was excruciating. Agatha stomps through the hallway, into the living room and sits down on the couch, waiting for Rio to join her - because she always did.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath when Rio sits down on the couch, cross-legged and pressed up against the far corner. “Like I said, we can’t… do this, anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, trying to seem indifferent. But Agatha can detect a tad of hurt buried beneath the initial facade. “Why?” She sighs.</p><p> </p><p>“You compromised it by letting Billy see the hickey. He put all the pieces together - realized we haven’t been acting normal,” Agatha explains, exasperated.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>I </em> compromised it?” Rio asks in pure disbelief, her pupils getting smaller out of anger. It had been a long time since Agatha saw her this mad. “<em>You’re </em>the one who gave me the hickey in the first place.”</p><p> </p><p>“How could you let him see it?” Agatha asks, matching Rio’s angry tone.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t!” Rio exclaims, “It was behind my ear! I didn’t think he would see it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well he fucking did!” Agatha roars back.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighs, “But you have <em> no right </em>blaming me for that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises her eyebrows, “Don’t I?”</p><p> </p><p>“You really want to stop this-” Rio says, gesturing between the two of them, “-because <em> Billy </em>figured it out. Just tell him not to tell anyone!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “Yeah, right.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’ll keep quiet, he respects you. He won’t compromise your position because you’re sleeping with me. It’s all just some weird idea someone placed in your head!”<br/><br/></p><p>Agatha snaps her head over to Rio, glaring daggers into her eyes, “But I’m your boss, and I’m older than you. The power imbalance makes it controversial, I shouldn’t have done this in the first place!” </p><p> </p><p>Hurt flashes in Rio’s eyes, “So what? You're just gonna… call it off?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, “Yeah, yeah I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I consensually slept with you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands up, “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is thrown back by Rio surrendering. She was honestly  thinking she wouldput up more of a fight.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t. Seconds later, Rio is out of the apartment, leaving Agatha in a deafening silence, feeling as if time has stopped ticking completely.</p><p> </p><p align="center">__________</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated herself for it. Everyday morning the next few days when she walked into the office, Rio wouldn’t smile at her, not even a gentle nod to acknowledge her presence. </p><p> </p><p>It made her uneasy, leaving something empty and aching inside of her. </p><p> </p><p>But she knew she inflicted this situation upon herself, she had no right to sulk about it. So everyday that week, she walked into the office, head held high. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, after an unusually dull and uninteresting week, Friday came around.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t get any better because when they were all sat in the conference room, eating out of their lunch boxes, Jen had a <em> brilliant </em>idea.</p><p> </p><p>Brilliant was a stretch because, in truth, Agatha hated it. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, are you seeing anyone?” Jen had asked. </p><p> </p><p>The question hadn’t been entirely random, they had been talking about Angelica earlier. A name that had come up <em> far </em>more than Agatha would like it to during the last few weeks. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, trying to seem uninterested in the subject. Because she was. She had no desire to date someone. That took too much energy and too much time that she could instead spend on work.</p><p> </p><p>“Then you should totally go on a date. Get out there, you know!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had tried to hide the disgusted expression that reached her face, “No.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why not? I can set you up with one of my friends.”</p><p> </p><p>Scoffing, Agatha stood up, ready to walk out, “Haven’t you done enough trying to set people up? Didn’t go so well last time, did it?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes it did, Angelica and Rio are going on another date tonight."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned around abruptly, locking eyes with Rio. What she thought was gonna be a smug smile, a playful look in her eyes, was instead something hollow and cold.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay…” Agatha said, finally agreeing, straightening her back to look more confident, “Yeah, whatever, I’ll go on <em> one </em>date.”</p><p> </p><p>She put emphasis on the <em> one </em>. Because, unlike Rio, Agatha wasn’t interested in going on dates. She didn’t care more than getting someone to bed, getting off and then saying goodbye the morning after - never to be seen again.</p><p> </p><p>With Rio, she had been different. It had been a long time since Agatha had slept with the same person more than once, it just wasn’t her thing. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha needed to prove to herself, and prove to Rio, that their situation didn’t mean anything to her. Just as little as it seemed to matter to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>That’s what brought her here.</p><p> </p><p>Later that Friday night, she was standing outside of a busy restaurant. It was fancy - her choice - with big windows and a waiter standing outside, ready to guide the guests to a table.</p><p> </p><p>Debating on whether or not to light a cigarette, she stands in silence, hugging herself to keep warm against the cold air that made her breaths turn into smoke clouds.</p><p> </p><p>She could hear the faint noise of friendly conversations as people walked past her on the sidewalk, and the traffic passing by.</p><p> </p><p>Already close to leaving, she checks the time. Five minutes until the date was scheduled, and if the woman didn’t show up on time, Agatha would leave.</p><p> </p><p>She hoped the woman would be late. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was never late, it was one redeeming quality about her. If a meeting was scheduled, she was on time. Agatha appreciated it, as someone who herself, almost never had been late in her entire adult life.</p><p> </p><p>One minute before Agatha is ready to turn around and leave this god-awful restaurant behind her, a woman shows up. She had her long, red hair in a braid laying over her shoulder, and dark blue eyes looking up at her since she was slightly shorter. The woman looked familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, right?” She said, smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her for a few seconds, trying to find out why the woman looked so familiar, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman extends her hand for a friendly handshake, “Natasha.” </p><p> </p><p><em> Oh</em>. Of course Agatha recognized her, it was a woman she’d slept with a few months back. A simple one night stand, nothing more. She couldn’t recollect any memories from that night since she was drunk out of her mind. Agatha might be good at forgetting names, but she could <em> never </em>forget a face.</p><p> </p><p>“Natasha,” She says, testing the name on her tongue, “I think we’ve met already."</p><p> </p><p>It takes a few seconds for Natasha to remember as well, clearly. Agatha can see the realization hit, the puzzle pieces coming together.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, yeah! Thought you looked familiar,” Natasha said with a gentle smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to reciprocate it, failing terribly, “Shall we go in?”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha nods and follows Agatha inside as the waiter leads them to a table for two in the far corner of the restaurant, where it was a lot quieter. </p><p> </p><p>This place was fancy. White tablecloths, adorned with small, sewn in roses, and a beautiful candle placed in the middle of the table.</p><p> </p><p>In hindsight, Agatha probably should’ve picked a less romantic restaurant. This might actually make Natasha think she was interested in anything more than what tonight would bring them.</p><p> </p><p>“So…” She starts, getting interrupted by a waiter quietly placing down two menus on the table. She clears her throat, “Natasha, what do you do for work?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a superspy.” Natasha says nonchalantly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is thrown back, looking at her, amazed, “I don’t think you're supposed to-” She stops herself when she sees the smug smirk on Natashas face, eyebrows raised as she drank from a glass of water, “You’re fucking with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha chuckles, placing down her water on the table, forming a wet ring around the bottom of it, “I’m a therapist.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Agatha smiles, although not finding the lie as amusing as Natasha seems to. She didn’t <em> hate </em>therapists, per se, she just didn’t believe in their practice. If it worked, Agatha would be fixed. She wouldn’t still cry herself to sleep every now and again, drunk out of her mind, right?</p><p> </p><p>“You seem disappointed,” Natasha says, although not seemingly hurt at all, more entertained, if anything. “We can pretend I’m a superspy. It’s certainly more interesting.”<br/><br/></p><p>Agatha huffs under her breath, looking down at the menu although she already knew what she wanted to get, having been here so many times already.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you getting?” Natasha asks, and for some reason that makes Agatha want to claw her eyes out. She was almost <em> too nice</em>, corners of her mouth always turned up, the gentle and loving tone in her voice. Like she actually <em> cared </em>what Agatha was having.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know yet,” Agatha says, still not looking up from the menu.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m having the truffle pasta. I heard it’s good here,” Natasha offers, taking another sip of water.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forces a smile. “I think I’m gonna go with the risotto,” she says, closing the menu and putting it on the table to signal to the waiter that they were done.</p><p> </p><p>“So…” Natasha clears her throat,” “What have you been up to?”</p><p> </p><p>“The usual,” Agatha pauses for a second, “work, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Right, yeah,” Natasha smiles. “You work with Jen, I assume?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to stop herself from rolling her eyes, “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha takes another sip of water to fill the silence that follows. Eventually, the waiter comes back to their table, taking their orders and with a swift motion grabs the menus.</p><p> </p><p>There was something about the silence that felt off. She’s so used to being around Rio, and that woman never stops talking or making noise. So when she sits across the table from Natasha, who just watches her in silence with a slight smile on her lips, she can’t help but miss the chaoticness of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Everything Natasha did felt calculated, like she had a mission or a motive behind every movement, every word, every smile. Unlike Rio, who was more tumultuous. Rio, who wouldn’t let the silence linger for this long.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels out of place, she doesn’t belong in this restaurant, not in this chair and certainly not across from Natasha.</p><p> </p><p>“Any interesting new case you want to tell me about?” Natasha asks right as they get served wine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “Even if there was, I wouldn't be allowed to tell anyone.” She brings the wine to her lips, taste testing it before taking a big sip.</p><p> </p><p>The wine hits her throat with a sudden familiarity, a comfort in the fruity taste. </p><p> </p><p>She tried not to think about Rio, she really tried to. Natasha was sat across from her, beautiful and probably very interesting, if Agatha tried enough. But she couldn’t help the bitter taste in her mouth when thinking about how easy it would be to talk to Rio right now. They could discuss a recent case without care for security. The conversations would flow easily between them. And Agatha certainly wouldn’t be squirming in her seat, already desperate to get out of the restaurant.</p><p> </p><p>But also, this was a dangerous thought. She knew that Rio didn’t want more than sex from her, and she had been the one to enforce it. <em> Fuckbuddies with a colleague </em>- it even sounded stupid. The fact that she for even a second thought it would work, that no one would find out.</p><p> </p><p>She’d been reckless, irrational - risking it all for a make out in the bathroom. And for what? To call it off after only a week? </p><p> </p><p>It had been nothing more than sex, a good bargain to get the pleasure she needed, while still keeping the adrenaline of something illicit. Which is why tonight shouldn’t be difficult, except for the entire date part. Natasha was the same, a good looking woman, friendly and good in bed. It was all the qualities that Agatha was searching for but still she doesn't feel whole. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha catches her attention again by clearing her throat, “Should we just… skip this whole dinner part?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is thrown off by the question, the boldness of it. Because yeah, she would <em> love </em>to escape this dinner. Going home, with Natasha, didn’t sound like a bad idea either - anything to get Rio off her mind. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ve already ordered. Let’s say we keep the anticipation for a bit longer, shall we?” Agatha says, pressing the wine glass to her lips and forcing a smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never been good at dates, hence why she avoided them. This one was no different. Smalltalk filled the space between them as they started eating, which was also something Agatha despised, but she put up with it for the entirety of the dinner.</p><p> </p><p>The other option, which would be to excuse herself and go home, didn’t seem appropriate either. It wasn’t that the conversation wasn’t nice, or full of uncomfortable silences, but it still made her feel uneasy.</p><p> </p><p>In a weak moment, she even imagined Rio taking Natashas place. Her gentle smile and scent of her perfume was almost present for a second. The thought made Agatha smile weakly. An expression which she quickly wiped off, disgusted with herself.</p><p> </p><p>She desperately needed to take Natasha to bed, needed to keep those thoughts in check.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe sleeping with someone else would fix it, get her mind off of things. Having someone else, tasting someone else, being touched so gently by someone else - it might help. At least then, she wouldn’t only have Rio fresh in her mind. Maybe someone more morally convenient.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha had ordered her second glass of wine, she had been afraid that Natasha would comment on it - a habit of therapists, if you will. But when she hadn’t, Agatha kept them coming, almost always having the glass pressed against her lips.</p><p> </p><p>She was now five glasses deep, feeling her senses starting to merge, her mind more clouded.</p><p> </p><p>It was a relief.</p><p> </p><p>In truth, Natasha herself hadn’t been much better. Now on her third glass of wine, she was starting to be more carefree, more talkative. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha found it entertaining, seeing the way Nataasha would occasionally stumble over her words. Suddenly, the thick tension between them had been lifted. Followed by carefree laughs and a few flirty compliments now and again.</p><p> </p><p>“I was gonna ask if we should order dessert,” Natasha starts, a smug smile on her lips, “but I’d rather just have dessert somewhere else.”</p><p> </p><p>At first, Agatha has to stop herself from frowning, finding the sentence way too off-putting and bold. But then, she imagines Rio saying it, and to her dismay, a shiver runs down her spine. </p><p> </p><p>She feels pathetic.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of answering Natasha, she nods and abruptly stands up, hoping that she would get the hint-- she did.</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later, they’re in the uber on their way to Agatha’s place. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t feel the same excitement that she had with Rio when they were in an uber in a similar situation. The anticipation and the tension was there, of course, but it didn’t grave itself into the walls, it didn’t press with the same weight on her chest, leaving her breathless. Instead, there is just a comfortable silence between them. of them saying anything because in truth, nothing needed to be said. Or at least Agatha thought so. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha, however, did not seem to be on the same page. About five minutes into the drive, Agatha can see her turn in the corner of her eye, watching Agatha like she’s trying to decipher something.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, what’s going on?” Natasha asks. She doesn’t seem mad, more concerned if anything. It was the kind of question that put Agatha on edge, mainly because it was a therapist asking it. They always carried an empathy in their tone, always feeling sorry for you.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha mumbles instead, turning away like a toddler and looking out the window instead.</p><p> </p><p>She feels a warm hand on her shoulder, urging her to turn around. “I’ve worked as a therapist for 10 years, I know when something is up,” she says, with a sudden sternness in her voice, unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s nothing going-”</p><p> </p><p>“Is it the dating thing?” Natasha interrupts, “Because it sure isn’t the sex thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turns around, glaring at her, “You therapists just love meddling in other people’s business don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha smiles. Agatha hates it. The smile was like a symbol that she had the upper hand, like she knew something Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“Would it help you if I said I'm not interested in anything more than sex?” Natasha asks, looking at Agatha like it was a promise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha actually relaxes a little at that. Shoulders going down, she can feel her tense in her muscles slowly disappearing. It helps a lot, knowing that Natasha didn’t have any further aspirations than tonight - then she wouldn’t be a bother later on.</p><p> </p><p>But like it’s a natural instinct, Agatha needs to be a bitch, “How do you know I’m not?”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha glares at her, not amused by the question - clearly already knowing Agatha was fucking with her. “You made it quite clear that you’re a <em> one-night-stand </em>type of person when we slept together a few years ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, because yeah it does sound like something she would do.</p><p> </p><p>“And,” Natasha continues, “You haven’t been interested in any conversation beyond small talk all night.”</p><p> </p><p>“You therapists always over analyze stuff.” Agatha brushes the statement off, even if knowing that what Natasha said was very true. Agatha hadn’t bothered to get to know her on a deeper level. She’s never interested in that.</p><p> </p><p>Except for-</p><p> </p><p>No.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Natasha says, smirking, “but I’m not wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, looking out the window again. </p><p> </p><p>The car comes to a sudden halt, and what once was dread for this night is replaced by something. Desire. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t interested in this woman, who climbed out of the black uber only seconds after her. The woman who got into her elevator and stood in the far corner, where Rio had stood way too many times. </p><p> </p><p>And she certainly wasn’t interested in her when her tongue entered her mouth mere seconds after they entered Agatha’s apartment. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t interested in Natasha - but she sure as hell was interested in the sensation of being wanted. Of someone having you entirely, even for just a moment. An hour or two. </p><p> </p><p>Which is why she’s feverishly tearing off her clothes, guiding Natasha through her hallway into the bedroom and throwing her on the bed. </p><p> </p><p>In a drunken haze, she presses Natasha to the sheets, kissing hungrily down her throat.</p><p> </p><p>For a second, she can taste Rio on her tongue. In an attempt to get it away, she enters Natasha’s mouth again - desperate to get the stain of Rio off her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Even her tongue tastes like Rio. But she doesn’t move in the same rhythm, with the same anger and desperation. Their tongues clash, and Agatha closes her eyes, trying to envision anything, <em> anything </em>that didn’t serve as a constant reminder of her.</p><p> </p><p>It’s futile.</p><p> </p><p>As Natasha brings her hand between the two of them and in a hurried motion unbuttons Agatha’s jeans, pressing her pointer- and middle finger against her clit, Agatha moans.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Rio</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>For a second, the world becomes quiet. The ministrations against her clit come to a halt, Natasha looking up at her in a worry, or confusion - Agatha wasn’t quite sure.</p><p> </p><p>Embarrassment fills her to the brim, along with anger, which was all directed to herself. Close to climbing off Natasha and asking her to leave, she instead buries her face in the crook of Natasha’s neck, in an attempt to close off the entire world, and herself. </p><p> </p><p>At that moment, Agatha is sure that Natasha will leave her there, in the silence of her own apartment, laying on the white sheets of her bed, still panting heavily. </p><p> </p><p>There’s an unspoken question lingering between them - <em> who is Rio? </em></p><p> </p><p>Natasha was well within her rights to ask. Hell, Agatha even expected it.</p><p> </p><p>What she didn’t expect, however, was the slow movements of Natasha’s fingers coming back, pressing hardly against her core.</p><p> </p><p>Nor did she expect the sudden power change. With one hand, Natasha grabs her shoulder and pushes her to the side, turning them around so she would be on top.</p><p> </p><p>Still skeptical of whether or not Natasha would walk away, Agatha keeps still, letting her take control - even for just a second.  </p><p> </p><p>As Natasha starts kissing down her abdomen, Agatha’s not even sure if Natasha had heard the slip or not.</p><p> </p><p>If she did, she pretended otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>Tongue moving skillfully over the bottom of her stomach before she with one swift motion pulls Agatha’s jeans down. With a smirk, she dives in, swirling her tongue skillfully around her clit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to bite her lip to stop the moan that almost escapes her. A name on the top of her tongue— Rio. </p><p> </p><p align="center">_________</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha wakes up the morning after, Natasha is still sleeping peacefully. Red hair splayed out like artwork over her pillow, one leg thrown over the blanket.</p><p> </p><p>Rubbing her eyes in an attempt to escape the hungover-headache that was a staple in Agatha’s life by now, she stands up and puts on an oversized t-shirt. </p><p> </p><p>She sighs as she looks at the clock on her kitchen wall. It was already 11 am; Agatha never woke up this late. </p><p> </p><p>Anxiety was crippling somewhere inside her. She didn’t regret yesterday, she got good sex out of it. But embarrassment filled her again, remembering her freudian slip from yesterday.</p><p> </p><p>Moaning Rio’s name. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to face whatever that could mean. It was probably something deep buried within her. Pent-up aggression, maybe?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t quite put her finger on it.</p><p> </p><p>When she’s in the midst of pouring up her second bowl of cereal, the bell on her front door rings. Annoyed, Agatha rolls her eyes and heads over to open, cereal pack still in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>She should have expected it. Because of course, <em> of course</em>--</p><p> </p><p>It's Rio. </p><p> </p><p>She looks disheveled, newly awake, hair in a tangled mess but still falling effortlessly down over her shoulders. </p><p> </p><p>She was breathtakingly beautiful. Her deep brown eyes pierced into Agatha’s with a hint of sadness, but they also looked hollow. It wasn’t the usual, investigative look that Agatha had come to associate her with. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she looked at Agatha without an agenda, there was no deeper motivation behind those eyes than to stand there, right now, in front of Agatha’s door.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asks, almost ready to close the door on her. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t see Rio’s face, not after yesterday.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to talk,” Rio simply states, pushing past Agatha in the doorway and letting herself into Agatha’s familiar home.</p><p> </p><p>“No we don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around, the eye-contact is enough to signal to Agatha that this, <em> whatever this is</em>, is important.</p><p> </p><p>“I talked to Billy,” Rio says over her shoulder as she goes towards Agatha’s kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha follows her through the apartment in hurried steps, trying to keep up. She was thrown by the carefree manners that Rio was displaying, walking around the apartment as if she owned the place. Agatha wanted to cuss her out for it.</p><p> </p><p>Then the words land, and she comes to a sudden halt, disbelief plastered on her entire face, “You did <em> what</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“I talked to Billy,” Rio says again, like it’s not a big deal at all. “I made up some story about how I met an old hookup earlier that night. Hence, the hickey.” </p><p> </p><p>“You talked<em> to Billy</em>?” Agatha asks through her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods, “He believed it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha starts walking towards Rio, who takes a step back. The anger in Agatha’s expression readable enough for her to figure out that she was not content with that choice. “So… let me get this straight, right?” Agatha lets out a mock chuckle, “You talked to Billy, and made him get off our asses. While <em> at the same time </em>admitting that we’d talked about it. If I told you about that he found out about the hickey - that can only mean one thing, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stands tall, knowing where Agatha’s going with this but refusing to back down.</p><p> </p><p>“If I told you about him seeing a hickey, that could only mean that we’ve had a conversation about it - which <em> confirms </em>his theory about us sleeping together,” Agatha explains, almost screaming. Desperate for Rio to understand the gravity of this situation. “You’re supposed to be a detective. Use your critical thinking skills!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t waver, “You’re insane for blaming this all on me! I’ve kept quiet, I’ve done my part! You don’t have any right to blame me for Billy finding out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh but I <em>do</em>, Rio!” Agatha shouts. The sound echoing against the walls.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh so <em> this </em>is Rio?” A pleased voice is heard from somewhere behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha.</p><p> </p><p>In the tumult of everything else, Agatha had forgotten about her. So deep in the fight that she didn’t even realize Natasha had woken up, and was currently leaning against the doorframe to the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p>How long had she been standing there?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks between Rio and Natasha, trying to make sense of the conversation. She sees the rage in Rio’s eyes as the realization hits her.</p><p> </p><p>“Who is this?” She asks, trying to remain calm but the light angry quiver in her voice betrays her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never seen her this furious.</p><p> </p><p>Smiling, Natasha walks into the room calmly. “Natasha,” she greets, putting out a hand for a friendly handshake.</p><p> </p><p>Rio does not seem to care, eyes still glaring daggers at Agatha. “You took her <em> home</em>?” She spits out in pure disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a step back, not anticipating such a strong reaction.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay so I’m confused about the relationship here.” Natasha starts, walking and standing in between them as if she was breaking up a cat-fight. “You’re together?” She asks, looking entirely at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha says, the word slicing through the air. </p><p> </p><p>They weren’t. They aren’t. They won’t.</p><p> </p><p>“So what’s going on?” Natasha asks, genuinely confused.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. Therapists and their continuous <em> caring </em>. </p><p> </p><p>“We’re colleagues,” Agatha sighs, giving up under Natasha’s unrelenting gaze. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles tauntingly, “Yeah, okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha glances between them before taking a step back, “Do you have coffee?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her, confused by the sudden change, “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Great, we’re gonna need a lot,” Natasha says, walking over to the kitchen counter and starting to search for the coffee filters.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks between the two women in her kitchen, and to her relief, Rio seems just as confused as she is. Because for a second, she thought she’d gone crazy. </p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Agatha manages.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re sorting this out,” Natasha explains, as if it was obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio share a look of disdain. They didn’t need to sort anything out. They were done, and they’d been so for almost a week now. There was nothing to talk about that hadn’t already been said--</p><p> </p><p><em> Screamed</em>, to be more accurate.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around and starts walking towards the front door. “I’ve seen what I needed to see,” she says over her shoulder, “I’m out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t deny the way her heart sinks at that, disappointment echoing through her. </p><p> </p><p>“Really? And what have you seen?” Natasha asks, amused. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses and turns around, gesturing between them both with her hand, “This.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs. The fact that Rio was mad that she brought home Natasha was at first thought annoying. She had no right to.</p><p> </p><p>But when Agatha lets the thought sit for a moment, she has to suppress a smile. Rio <em> cares </em>about who Agatha sleeps with. What that could entail, Agatha didn’t quite know. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh this,” Natasha laughs lightly, pointing between herself and Agatha, “Is nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I’m supposed to believe that?” Rio mutters, but still lingers in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha smiles, again, amused by the entire situation. “Yes,” she says before nonchalantly pushing the on-button on the coffee maker, the loud rumbling noise filling the now silent apartment, bouncing between the walls.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands in shock, not knowing quite what to say or do. Anger bottling up inside of her, close to the brim, almost threatening to spill over. But somewhere within her, she finds entertainment in the situation.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha then turns to Agatha, “She’s feisty, I can see why you like her.”</p><p> </p><p>Both Rio’s and Agatha’s eyebrows fly up at the same time, startled by the accusation. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t-”</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t.” Rio interrupts, as if she wanted to hear the words come out of her mouth instead of Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha looks at Agatha,  “So you didn’t moan-” Natasha starts, feigning confusion, but Agatha could see the smirk hiding behind those words. </p><p> </p><p>“No.” She interrupts sternly. Having to face her mistake yesterday was enough. If <em> Rio </em>found out, Agatha wasn’t sure if she would be able to live with herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Moan?” Rio asks, confused, but there’s still an undeniable edge to her words. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha rolls her eyes, “<em>Oh my god </em> we’re sorting this out. Right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“This doesn’t concern you.” Agatha scolds, glaring at her.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha shrugs, “You kinda made it my business when you slept with me last night.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs in utter disgust, “Yeah… I’m leaving."</p><p> </p><p>“Wait Rio,” Natasha hurries. “Do you want coffee before you leave?”</p><p> </p><p>“What, do you live here now or something?” Rio mocks, but still doesn’t make a move to actually walk out. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio snaps, “I can’t be mad you actually slept with some <em> less than a week </em>after we called it off?”</p><p> </p><p>“We weren’t exclusive,” Agatha tries. She doesn’t even believe it herself. If she found out that Rio had slept with someone else, or even <em> made out </em>with someone during that week when they were alleged ‘fuck buddies’ - it would’ve pissed her off.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, okay,” Rio almost laughs, her anger bubbling up. “So you slept with other women when we were?”</p><p> </p><p>“No…” Agatha says through her teeth. “But you’re such a hypocrite, you went on a date <em> yesterday </em> with Angelica!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but I didn’t sleep with her!” Rio roars.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s enough,” Natasha calls. Her voice coming from somewhere behind Agatha now - who hadn’t realized that in the heat of the argument she had unconsciously moved closer to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha crosses the kitchen island in silence and makes a beeline towards the couch. She takes an armchair and places it in front of the couch as she sits down. Two coffee mugs in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha stay silent for a second, looking at each other confused.</p><p> </p><p>“Come sit,” Natasha calls for them, nodding at the couch. </p><p> </p><p>“Unless you didn’t catch up on it,” Agatha retorts bitterly, but still moving with uncertain steps towards the couch. “We,” She gestures between her and Rio, “Are <em> not </em>a couple - and we certainly don’t need therapy. If that’s where you’re going with this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure?” Natasha smirks, handing one of the cups to Agatha when she’s within arms length. Then she turns to Rio, who is still wavering in the kitchen, a friendly smile on her face, “Rio, come on, I can’t do this with Agatha alone she will claw my head off.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs, muttering “might be for the better,” but still walking over, grabbing the other coffee mug and sitting down on the far end of the couch. Pressed up against the corner with her back, cross-legged and holding the warm mug with two hands, like a child.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha looks between the two of them, sitting on either end of the couch, with a pleased smile on her face. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated it.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted nothing more than to walk away, scream at the both of them to <em> leave her the fuck alone </em>and then taking a long shower and rethink all her life choices. But she didn’t seem so lucky. Life is never fair, after all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew it.</p><p> </p><p>“So, can <em> one </em>of you give a quick recap?” Natasha sighs, leaning back into the armchair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, rolling her eyes, “We slept together, then we didn’t, then we did again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay…” Natasha sighs, “and why did you call it off?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because she can’t keep her mouth shut,” Agatha sneers.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You’re </em>the one who gave me the hickey!” Rio practically shouts, holding up her hands in defeat when Natasha glares at her. “Talk about keeping your mouth shut,” she grumbles under her breath instead. </p><p> </p><p>“Why did you need to keep it a secret, then?” Natasha asks, almost sounding intrigued now.</p><p> </p><p>“Ask her,” Rio says pointedly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs, “We’re not doing this again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Doing what?” Rio snaps.</p><p> </p><p>“Arguing about <em>why </em>I want to keep it a secret,” Agatha explains, exasperated. “I’ve told you why countless times.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me again for good measure,” Rio taunts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs but goes quiet, sulking back into the couch and clutching her mug as if it was gonna run away. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha rolls her eyes, “Okay, this is never gonna work.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t say,” Agatha mocks sarcastically, sulking impossibly low into the couch.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s take a different approach then.” Natasha says, leaning back and crossing her arms over her chest, looking between the both of them. “Agatha, why are you afraid of people knowing?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not <em> afraid</em>,” Agatha sneers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs, earning a glare from Agatha’s direction, “So what is it then?” Rio asks, enraged, “Am I that embarrassing to be seen with? Is it <em> so </em>embarrassing that you can’t even let other people know? That I have to be stuffed away in a corner, pretend like it never happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that and you know it,” Agatha says sternly.</p><p> </p><p>“No but I <em> don't </em> know, Agatha! You say it’s because of the job and I want to believe you <em> so badly</em>. But no matter how much I tell you that the team wouldn't care - because they wouldn’t - you don’t change your mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, “How could you possibly know they wouldn’t?” </p><p> </p><p>“Have you ever even tried getting to know them? They’re nice, they’re caring! You know, deep inside, that they wouldn’t, so you’re literally making up excuses so you’ll have a reason to stop this.” Rio takes a deep breath, trying to control her anger. “Why are you fighting it so hard? <em> If </em> you wanted to continue, <em> whatever it is we’re doing</em>, you wouldn’t come up with excuses.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not coming up with excuses! Why do you even care so much? We were literally just fuck-buddies - It was just sex!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well for me it fucking wasn’t Agatha!” Tears spill up in her eyes, threatening to escape. “Have you ever fucking thought about that? Or are you so self-absorbed that you don’t think about anyone else, ever?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is left too stunned to speak for a second, not able to move or to say anything in response. She didn’t expect that. </p><p> </p><p>The pause gives enough time for Rio to stand up, furiously place her mug on the table with enough force that coffee spills out underneath it on over the wooden table, and be out the door.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t process what happened.</p><p> </p><p>One second, Rio was there, sitting beside her. The other, she hears her front door slammed shut, and Rio is gone.</p><p> </p><p>Natasha doesn't seem as shocked, almost a pleased look on her face, “Glad we cleared that up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is close to standing up, to running. To catch Rio in the elevator, scream at her and ask <em> what the fuck </em>she meant by saying that. She needed answers. </p><p> </p><p><em> ‘For me it wasn’t’ </em> like a mantra in her mind.</p><p> </p><p>“What did she mean?” Agatha asks, eventually, almost exhausted trying to figure it out.</p><p> </p><p>“That it wasn’t just sex for her?” Natasha asks, tilting her head and examining Agatha in a way that makes her feel uneasy.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, but what does that <em> mean </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha smiles warmly, a comfort in it, ‘“It means she likes you, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">_______</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The entire weekend, Agatha had tried to call, getting to voicemail every time. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know what she was gonna say, not yet anyway. But she knew that she needed to reach her, she needed to tell her that maybe, <em>maybe</em>, she felt the same way.</p><p> </p><p>Because the more she thought about it - the entire thing with Rio - it had become more than just sex for her too. Even if it started like that, nothing more than just something fun, something entertaining to get her edge off - after the second time, it didn’t feel like that anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Sex with Rio was different than with Natasha or with any other woman she’s been with. It involved feelings, passion and desire to a level that hadn’t been reached with anyone else. Rio was a drug, and Agatha had become an addict.</p><p> </p><p>There were so many things left unspoken - which is why Agatha looked forward to seeing her at the office today. Even if it involved other people in their surroundings, she would still be able to <em> see </em>her - and hopefully talk to her, if she manages to get them alone.</p><p> </p><p>She walks into the conference room with confidence, fully prepared to run into Rio.</p><p> </p><p>But the clock started ticking, the time getting closer and closer to 8:30 am, when they were gonna start their morning meeting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio still hadn’t showed up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could never in a million years have expected this. Rio had almost never missed a day of work. Not since she started working with Agatha three years ago, at least. She was always there, no matter how tired or hungover. Only time she’s ever missed work is when she had to call in sick, upon a doctor's orders. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had become a staple at the office. Even if the rest of the team, although almost never Lilia, would stay at home at least once every few months out of some bullshit reason, Rio was always there. Always.</p><p> </p><p>So this sudden change throws her off greatly. Even if she probably should have expected it - Rio confessed her feelings for her only two days earlier - it was unpredictable.</p><p> </p><p>She holds the presentation about a new case they’d been assigned to. However, she can’t seem to focus on it. Mind running, thinking back on that Saturday morning, and all the other conversations she’s had with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the team probably noticed she was out of it. But she couldn’t, at that moment, seem to care. She would probably regret that later.</p><p> </p><p>Later, however, came sooner than she thought.</p><p> </p><p>When she’d wrapped up the meeting, fumbling to get her disorganized papers off the table, Alice walks up to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Worried about Rio?” She asks. It’s not a question, more of a statement.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her, eyes wide open in shock, “How did you-"</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve known Rio for three years,” Alice sighs, resting her hip against the table, “<em>And </em>I work as a detective. I can see when Rio’s fallen for someone.”</p><p> </p><p>“She hasn’t-”</p><p> </p><p>Alice interrupts her with a groan, “You know that’s a lie.”</p><p> </p><p>“How long have you known?” Agatha asks, giving up on the facade - it’s too late now.</p><p> </p><p>Alice looks up at the ceiling, as if she’s counting, “How long has it been? A month?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, “You’ve known for <em> a month</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? You’ve not been very secretive.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffs, wanting to disagree but knowing that Alice is telling the truth, “Does everyone know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Jen and Lilia still don’t,” Alice confirms, allowing a deep breath of relief to escape Agatha, “But I think Billy has caught up on you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha sighs, “yeah, he has.” She breaths for a moment, letting the words sink in. “And what, you don’t…care?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice almost laughs, “Why would I care?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I’m your boss? It’s highly unprofessional?” Agatha explains weakly, trying to piece her worldview together again.</p><p> </p><p>Alice lets out a low chuckle at that, “I don’t care. The rest wouldn’t either… If anything, it may make you more pleasant to work with.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at her, although she might be right, “I could have you fired for that.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice holds up her hands in defeat, still a light smirk on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you know where she could be?” Agatha asks, defeated.</p><p> </p><p>Alice sighs, “Probably at home.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs her coat in a hurry, legs moving towards the exit before she can even give it a second thought.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t even know her address!” Alice yells before Agatha can slink out the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>“Text me it.” </p><p>

<p>Agatha decides to walk. </p><p> </p><p>Alice had texted Rio's address mere seconds after their exchange at the office. Which, surprisingly, wasn’t far away - only a fifteen minute walk. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha soon regretted the decision to walk though, as the wind started to whip her face with icy raindrops. She could feel her entire body becoming rigid due to the cold, but she still walked with hurried steps along the pavements. </p><p> </p><p>The heel of her boots hit  the ground with a loud sound each time. Loud enough, at least, that they pulled Agatha out from her wandering thoughts, which were threatening to consume her entirely. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t think straight. Trying to compose herself with ragged breaths of cold air, but nothing could stop the words Alice had said to her replaying in her mind, over and over again like a mantra. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘I can see when Rio’s fallen for someone.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sure, Natasha had confirmed to Agatha that Rio liked her, which came as enough of a shock. Alice telling her that Rio’s <em> fallen for her </em> was on an entirely different level. A level she hadn’t even dared to dream about before then.</p><p> </p><p>It was a  reality in which she could find herself getting comfortable. A warm thought in the midst of the cold environment. She could feel her chest heating up, her cheeks becoming more flushed - this time not due to the weather. </p><p> </p><p>The reality of that truth made something settle within Agatha. Maybe, she was ready to face her truth too. Whatever it meant.</p><p> </p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she’s standing outside of Rio’s front door. Her hair is a wet mess, thanks to the late October weather. Standing there, she feels a little lost. Like a wet dog. She doesn’t know whether or not to ring the bell, to knock, to storm in?</p><p> </p><p>She reads again and again the “Vidal” namesign on the door, trying to make sure that she hadn’t miscalculated the floors of the building. But everytime she reads the black letters spread out, it says the same.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Vidal. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She really needed to gather up the courage to knock by now. She knew it. She even felt a little pathetic, standing there, all nervous. </p><p> </p><p>With a deep breath, she gathers enough confidence to ring the doorbell.</p><p> </p><p>Within seconds, she can hear unsure footsteps coming closer from inside the flat. The sound matches the pacing of her heartbeat - becoming louder and louder with each step. </p><p> </p><p>Rio opens the door. </p><p><br/>Clearly, she does not expect Agatha to be the one standing on the other side. Her eyebrows fly up in shock. In an almost automatic bodily reaction, she closes the door again. Not even saying a word.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha’s quicker, her reflex’s  making her grab the side of the door, forcing it to stay open. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” she sighs, watching Rio tenderly through the narrow opening.</p><p> </p><p>Rio falters, her grip on the handle losing its strength, making it possible for Agatha to pry the door more open.</p><p> </p><p>“For?” Rio asks exhaustedly, finally giving in and opening the door fully, letting Agatha step inside.</p><p> </p><p>“A lot,” Agatha says, taking off her wet coat and hanging it over a chair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her with animosity, “That’s not an apology.”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me start over,” Agatha says hurriedly, desperately needing Rio to listen to her. “Can we sit down?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks skeptical at first, but then she shrugs and walks through her apartment without a word. Agatha follows her, through the first hallway and into an airy kitchen, plants climbing the walls around the window. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sits down in a chair by the round kitchen table, nodding at the chair opposite her as an invitation.</p><p> </p><p>Hesitantly, Agatha sits down. The apartment was completely silent except for the slight humming of the refrigerator, and the screeching sound of the chair legs being scraped along the wooden floor.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha starts again, “For… everything.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watches her carefully - almost as if she’s examining every facial expression, trying to detect a lie, or something ingenuine behind Agatha’s words. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know…” Agatha continues, trying to taste the words on her tongue, “I didn’t know that you <em> liked </em>me.” She grimaches, the words tasted bitter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs, “Thought it was obvious.”</p><p> </p><p>“No it wasn’t,” Agatha murmurs. “If it was, I wouldn’t have acted like I did… I think.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m bad at this… Apologizing, I mean. I don’t know how to do it but I’m genuinely sorry for treating you that way. For… blaming it all on you and saying those stuffs about you… about <em>us</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Us?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to glaze over it, shaking her head. “You were the one to initiate the ‘fuck-buddies’ thing - I was <em> so sure </em>by then you didn’t like me back,” she explains, not realizing the Freudian slip until it’s too late. </p><p> </p><p>“Like you <em> back </em>?” Rio asks, one eyebrow raised and a smug smile on her lips.</p><p> </p><p><em> ‘Fuck’ </em> Agatha thinks bitterly. Honestly, she hadn’t planned for it to come out that way. In truth, she didn’t even recognise her own feelings. </p><p> </p><p>“I guess what I meant to say is,” She continues, trying to brush over the mistake. “I lied about it being just sex for me. Well- to be honest, that’s not what I said. I said ‘it was just sex’ because <em> I </em> thought <em> you </em>thought that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her confused, trying to puzzle everything together, “So what you’re saying is… you like me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t <em> know, </em>” Agatha groans, mostly annoyed with herself.</p><p> </p><p>“You better make up your mind,” Rio says sternly, the teasing glint in her eyes gone.</p><p> </p><p>“All I know is that, well, the sex didn’t feel like<em> just sex </em> . It was different with you than with everyone else, with Natasha <em> . </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sees Rio flinch at that, and smirks - she didn’t think Rio was the jealous type. But she’s been proven wrong again, just like she was that Saturday morning when they last spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“With them it was just… sex. But with you it’s more than that. It’s everything in between, it’s the moments at the office, and the silent mornings we share after. With the others it’s never been more than one night, one night and then it’s over. It’s not like that with you, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>At that, Rio smiles. But it’s bittersweet, still sadness to be found in the midst of her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels the need to continue rambling, “I’m sorry for being such a dick when we were still… what we were. But I couldn’t help it. I was afraid to lose my position and to lose respect from everyone - but it didn’t strike me that the thing I should've been worried about was losing <em> you. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes were watering, tears threatening to spill over. Rio promptly closes her eyes to fight them away. She had no idea why she was crying - if it was because she was happy, relieved, sad, angry? So many feelings were bottling up inside her at the same time, making it impossible to stand her ground.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha continued her unrelenting ramble, “And it wasn’t until I found out that Alice has known during the entire time, and didn’t mind it, that I realized that I’ve been scared for nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” Rio says, opening her eyes wide in surprise, “Alice knew?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, “Yeah… she told me earlier.”</p><p> </p><p>“She didn’t even tell me,” Rio mumbles, looking down at the table, unable to meet Agatha’s eyes. “How did she find out?”</p><p> </p><p>“She told me that she just knew, even the first Monday after we slept together. We’ve apparently not been very good at keeping the secret.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio laughs slightly, although there’s sadness within it, “I could’ve told you that.”</p><p> </p><p>“At least we tried,” Agatha attempts at comforting, it almost sounds like an attempt at a joke.</p><p> </p><p>They sit in silence for a while, just letting the conversation sink in. It’s not uncomfortable, they’re so content within each other’s presence by now that they don’t need to speak. Even if not nearly everything that needed to be said had been, it was enough. </p><p> </p><p>“You know…” Rio eventually breaks the silence, a smile tugging at the corner of her lips now, “If I didn’t like you, did you honestly think I would’ve put up with it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles, “Probably not.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles back, fidgeting with her necklace, “Can you at least tell me one thing?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods nervously. She wasn’t sure if she would even know the answer to whatever Rio was gonna ask.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you talk about me with Natasha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thrown off by the question, honestly expecting something entirely different, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then how come she knew who I was?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did she?” Agatha asks, trying to sound surprised but failing miserably at the lie.</p><p> </p><p>“You know what, I can just call her,” Rio teases, standing up to grab her phone from the kitchen counter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “You don’t have her number.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jen would give me it in a heartbeat,” Rio counters.</p><p> </p><p>She has a point. Agatha freaks out for a second internally, unsure of what to say or do. She knew Natasha absolutely would have no problem in exposing her - she’d probably even be happy to.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” she mumbles under her breath, but still loudly enough so Rio hears it. She turns around with a smirk on her lips, looking at Agatha with a glint in her eye.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio asks smugly, abandoning her phone on the counter and walking towards Agatha again. “Why won’t you tell me? What did you say to her about me?”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t <em> tell </em>her anything,” Agatha says, panicking now. </p><p> </p><p>“Then <em> how </em>did she know about me?” </p><p> </p><p>By now, Agatha’s sure Rio knows. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be pushing it this hard. It’s like she wants to hear the confession from Agatha’s mouth. It was cruel.</p><p> </p><p>“Because I fucking moaned it, okay?” Agatha blurts out before she can add any of her critical thinking skills. </p><p> </p><p>The critical thinking that would, surely, advise against such a statement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, apparently, had <em> no idea </em>that was the answer. She raises both her eyebrows in shock, looking at Agatha in complete surprise. </p><p> </p><p>Then her expression turns more teasing. A slight, proud grin on her face as she, one step at a time, closes the distance between them in the kitchen. She halts right beside Agatha, resting her weight on her palm pressed against the wooden table.</p><p> </p><p>“You did what?” She smirks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes in annoyance, mostly at herself for falling into this trap. She looks up at Rio, who’s now hovering over her, lips mere inches apart.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make me say it again,” Agatha practically begs.</p><p> </p><p>“You moaned my name? <em> When? </em>”</p><p> </p><p>“When me and Natasha-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio interrupts her with a loud laugh, “Are you fucking with me?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha forces out, ready to sink beneath the earth's surface, never to show her face again. Not to anyone, and especially not to Rio. She hadn’t felt this humiliated in years-- possibly <em> ever. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio looks amused, towering over Agatha, eyes flickering between her eyes and lips. “And you’re still unsure whether you like me or not?” Rio asks, amused.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, “You’re so annoying.”</p><p> </p><p>But she still doesn’t make a move to actually get away from Rio. If anything, she closes the space between them even more, feeling the faint brush of Rio’s breaths against her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You like me,” Rio muses, their lips now nearly touching each other.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t find the right words to respond. Because the answer is probably yes, she even knows it deep down. But how can she admit such a thing? The words get stuck in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she leans in. The kiss is gentle at first, as if she tries to seep in those unspoken words into Rio’s mouth. Rio kisses her back with the same tenderness, closing her eyes and leaning in further.</p><p> </p><p>Impatient, Agatha licks along Rio’s lower lip, earning a gasp and slowly entering her mouth. It felt like home - although Agatha would never admit that. At least not right now. </p><p> </p><p>Right now, all that mattered was Rio. The feeling of her tongue entering her mouth, licking along the top of her mouth, and the way she whimpered when Agatha lightly grazed her teeth against her lip.</p><p> </p><p>The outside world goes quiet. All Agatha can hear is the steady breaths from Rio, the quiet moan she releases in response when Agatha places her hands on her hips, guiding her to sit down in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>Their chests press against each other as Rio starts to involuntarily grind down on Agatha’s lap. Agatha breaks the kiss in a low, guttural moan, and begins to kiss down Rio’s neck,starting by her pulse point and then moving down along her collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at the ceiling, crooking her neck to grant Agatha more access. She allows quiet whimpers to escape her at the subtle touches and caresses of Agatha’s lips and fingers across her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, before they can get too lost in the moment, Rio whispers: “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, like drawn from a haze looks up at her, worry apparent in her eyes. It wasn’t the first time Rio interrupted them mid-makeout, but Agatha didn’t always like the outcome.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t do this unless,” Rio takes a deep breath, “Unless you promise not to leave.”</p><p> </p><p>“Leave?” Agatha asks, confused.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah like, if this is another one-night-stand.” Rio explains and then laughs a little, trying to get the edge off, “Well… one-day-stand, it’s only 10 am.”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t leave,” Agatha reassures, reaching to reattach her lips to Rio’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shies away and leans back, out of Agatha’s reach. “Promise?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans, “Yes, but we can’t tell anyone.” </p><p> </p><p>The words had become like a mantra for her. They hooked up, she told Rio not to tell anyone, someone figured out - it’s a constant loop. Rio recognizes this, as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you actually an idiot?” Rio asks. Agatha tries to find some sarcasm buried beneath those words, but to no use. Rio was not joking. “You told me a few minutes ago that Alice already knows.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha sighs, defeated. “We don’t have to <em> hide </em>but like… do we have to deliberately tell them?”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell them?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks up at her, “That we’re together?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow, “Is <em> that </em>what we are?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans back, studying Rio as if she’s trying to detect a lie, looking between Rio’s brown eyes in confusion. Rio, who’s now looking down at her with an undeniable smirk. “Are we not?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, it’s a genuine, sincere laugh and she throws her head back. At first, Agatha was scared she might be mocking her, but her doubts disappear the second Rio looks back down at her. A warm smile on her lips as she brushes a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Normally, people ask about that.” Rio explains, pressing a fleeting kiss on Agatha’s lips, “But yeah, okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs in relief, leaning in to kiss her again. This time with confidence she had never quite felt around Rio. The certainty within it, the familiarity, and the happiness that warmed her chest at the newfound situation - it all poured itself into the kiss as she entered Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Her tongue licked languidly against Rio, arms finding their way around her waist. She presses their faces impossibly close, breathing in everything that is Rio. Her touch, her scent, her taste. She tried to consume it all like a woman starved.</p><p> </p><p>The moment was beautiful-Agatha never wanted it to end. She wanted to sit there, in Rio’s beautiful kitchen, with Rio on her lap, forever. She could get used to this feeling. She <em> would </em>get used to this feeling - but she would never complain.</p><p> </p><p>Because everytime she kissed Rio it felt like the first time. Electricity flowing between them, desire in their movements, and the new ways Rio could always make her lose her footing.</p><p> </p><p>Whether it was via a scrape of teeth, a hand in her hair or a simple movement against her thighs. Agatha got lost in it. Everytime.</p><p> </p><p>She breaks the kiss, but still lingers her touch on Rio’s lips, “Bedroom.”</p><p> </p><p>It was meant to come out as a question, but it reached Rio as a demand. </p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Rio climbs off Agatha’s lap and reaches out her hand. </p><p> </p><p>Breathlessly, Agatha grabs it and lets Rio lead her into the bedroom. Just like the kitchen, the bedroom is airy. Sun streaming in via a big window covered in plants, and a big, unmade bed with white covers in the middle of the room. The light gray walls are covered in beautiful paintings and framed photographs.</p><p> </p><p>The room screamed Rio, and even the entire place smelled like her. It was intoxicating.</p><p> </p><p>Rio guides them to the bed, sitting down and looking up at Agatha, awaiting her next move. Agatha smirked, she had an idea in mind, “Let me see that tattoo you were so proudly telling everyone about.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows, “It’s on my lower back.”</p><p> </p><p>“Show me it,” Agatha demands, standing her ground beside the bed and watching in awe as Rio begins to strip.</p><p> </p><p>It’s slow, almost teasing in its nature as Rio looks up at her, lust in the depths of her eyes. She crosses her arms and drags the sweatshirt off her body, revealing her naked chest underneath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathes heavily, putting her hands in her pockets to refrain herself from reaching out and dragging her fingers against Rio’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her again before laying down and calmly dragging down her pants, lifting her hips to ease the motion. Agatha becomes entranced as she looks down at her, pupils widened in lust as she eases the pants of her feet, kicking them across the room.</p><p> </p><p>Once they’re off, Rio’s left on the bed in only her underwear, a black lace thong hugging her hips. Agatha’s stunned for a second; did Rio <em> know </em>she would come by? </p><p> </p><p>Her thought is cut-off by the movement of Rio as she moves up along the bed, leaning against the pillows, with her chest pressed to the sheets and hair like artwork beautifully displayed against the pillow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moves over to the bed and sits down, straddling the back of Rio’s thighs and leans down, slowly dragging her palms along her back. </p><p> </p><p>She stops when she reaches the tattoo, placed a little to the side above her hip - a beautiful small orchid displayed against her skin. She shuffles her position to reach down, covering it with her lips and kissing it attentively before moving up, planting kisses all along her spine and up to the crook of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>Rio moans softly at the gentle touches, arching her back into the bed from the pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>“Orchid,” Agatha mumbles between kisses, her breath teasing the shell of Rio’s ear. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“My moms favorite,” Rio explains between heavy sighs, “I remember she had a plant of them in almost every room.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums appreciatively in her ear, “It’s beautiful.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles, although Agatha can’t see it, “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up, still straddling Rio’s thighs but begins to unbutton her shirt. She can feel Rio wiggle beneath her and leans down to whisper in her ear: “Don’t move.”</p><p> </p><p>“But I want to see you,” Rio explains, sounding almost too much like a whine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs at her request. Yet, she climbs off Rio’s body, allowing her to fully turn around and lay on her back instead. Agatha smirks before slowly climbing on top of her again, straddling her thighs while continuing the work on her buttons.</p><p> </p><p>She throws the shirt somewhere in the corner before leaning down. Her long curls teasing against Rio’s chest in the motion. She presses her lips down on Rio’s collarbone, earning a quiet gasp. Rio throws her head down on the pillow, looking up at the ceiling as Agatha continues to move her skilled tongue against Rio’s breast.</p><p> </p><p>Gently, she licks a circle around Rio’s left nipple before taking it in her mouth, grazing her teeth against it. Rio releases a quiet whimper at the feeling, which spurs Agatha on - taking the other one into her mouth and doing the same.</p><p> </p><p>With practiced movements, Agatha drags her palm between their bodies, resting it on the edge of Rio’s underwear with a teasing featherlight touch against her skin underneath it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans impatiently, involuntarily moving her hips up to meet Agatha’s touch with increased pressure.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickers and removes her hand. And with a sly smirk on her lips, she climbs off Rio’s lap - earning an unappreciative frown from Rio who looks up at her in confusion.</p><p> </p><p>“C’mon,” She pleads.</p><p> </p><p>“Beg for it,” Agatha says with the same smirk still plastered on her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, “I’m not gonna-”</p><p> </p><p>“Beg.” Agatha says, more demanding now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, thinking this is some kind of game. Agatha surely wouldn’t- “Fine then I will do it myself.” She reaches down with her right hand, fingers gently grazing against her clit, the fabric becoming a barrier.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her. For a second she debates on whether or not she should just sit there and watch as Rio gets herself off. But evidently, she grabs Rio’s wrists harshly, forcing them above her head, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up at her, annoyed, “I’m still not gonna beg.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins, looking almost amused, “We’ll see.”</p><p> </p><p>With strong hands on either of her thighs, she forces Rio’s legs apart, exposing her, already damp, underwear.</p><p> </p><p>She leans down and presses quick, wet kisses along the inside of Rio’s thighs. Everytime she gets close to the hem of the black lace, she starts over from the bottom, right by the knee. </p><p> </p><p>In response, Rio lets out a groan of frustration, losing her patience more and more every time. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks against her skin, dragging her teeth along it to add pressure before biting down at the top of her thigh. This time, not going down to restart her ministrations by her knee - instead, she blows slightly on the fabric of her underwear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lets out a gratifying hum, leaning her head back thinking she’s <em> finally </em>gonna get the contact she so craved.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had other plans. With one, swift motion, she removes the thong, abandoning it by the side of the bed. </p><p> </p><p>With a teasing touch, she presses her fingers gently to Rio’s cunt, gathering her wetness on her index and middle finger before, with a tormentingly slow motion, placing them in her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>She closes her eyes with a moan, the taste of Rio too familiar and too addicting. Rio meets her eyes, looking up at her lustfully with parted lips, watching the action in awe. A moan at the tip of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha uses it to her advantage. Removing her fingers from her own mouth and placing them on Rio’s lips, looking at her with a subtle demand.</p><p> </p><p>After a few seconds of doubt, Rio opens her mouth further, allowing Agatha access as she forces her fingers in. Rio licks them, tasting herself mixed with the recognizable taste of Agatha’s spit. </p><p> </p><p>At first, it almost feels humiliating. But then Rio closes her eyes, focusing entirely on the sensation of Agatha’s fingers pressed against her tongue and it slowly consumes her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha removes her fingers, immediately replacing them with her tongue. She licks languidly into Rio's mouth as she moans, lost in the moment.</p><p> </p><p>She drags her, now wet, fingers along the side of Rio’s abdomen, making Rio think, even if just for a second, that Agatha had forgotten about the entire idea that she needs to ‘beg’.</p><p> </p><p>To Rio’s displeasure, she hadn’t.</p><p> </p><p>With a light touch, she teased against Rio’s clit again, applying pleasure but not nearly enough. Rio squirms against her fingers in an attempt to force contact instead.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does not seem amused, removing her hand in a second and placing it on the curve of Rio's waist instead. Her facial expression screams annoyance, but her eyes betray her - almost looking entertained at Rio’s behaviour.</p><p> </p><p>“Beg,” She, yet again, demands simply.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t want to cave in, she <em> really </em>doesn’t. So she stands her ground, thinking that sooner or later Agatha would give up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tightens her hold on her waist, almost to the amount that it was hurting as her fingernails almost broke her skin at the pressure, “I’m not gonna touch you until you beg.”</p><p> </p><p>“What if I lock myself in the bathroom and do it myself?” Rio counters, looking almost smug at the idea.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, “You can try.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sits up promptly. She was actually trying to make a point, so going to the bathroom seemed like a smart idea now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha places a  hand on her chest, forcing her to lay down again. She hits the bed with a thud, almost bouncing from the sheer impact due to Agatha’s strong push.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickers again, knowing she has the upper hand as she can see the fight escaping Rio’s eyes as she sighs. </p><p> </p><p>Proudly, Agatha leans down and kisses her with an unhurried motion, entering her mouth swiftly. Rio responds immediately, taking it as an award, and with skilled movements kisses her back. Smiling against her mouth when she can hear a quiet moan escape her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls away, gently sucking right by her pulse point before moving upwards.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a brat,” Agatha muses into her ear with a husky whisper, “Beg. It will make this so much easier.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio squirms underneath her, hating herself for almost giving in as a shiver runs down her spine at the words.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, seeing the fire and the restraint on Rio slowly dismantling. “C’mon,” She whispers, “I know you want to.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shakes her head. Mostly to clear her head, feeling Agatha’s words working on her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches down, teasing her clit again with the tip of her fingers, “Be a good girl, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers at the words, biting her lips to stop herself from moaning as Agatha teasingly enters her with just the tip of her finger - but not enough. Never enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Just say it,” Agatha whispers, placing teasing kisses along the side of her neck, “Say, <em> Please </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” It comes out as a quiet plea, almost inaudible. </p><p> </p><p>“Please, <em> what </em>?” Agatha asks, dragging it out further.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans and arches her back, trying to make Agatha yield. She doesn’t. “Please fucking touch me already.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks, leaning up to press a quick peck on Rio’s lips, “Good girl."</p><p> </p><p>Without any further warning, she quickly pushes her fingers inside all the way down to her knuckles. Beginning to finger her relentlessly at an unapologetic pace.</p><p> </p><p>Rio arches her back and closes her eyes, the gratifying sensation after all that humiliation overtaking her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans down and takes a nipple into her mouth, earning yet another loud moan from Rio - who she can feel is starten to tighten around her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Determined, she starts to move her lips down Rio’s stomach. Kissing along it while still continuing her unrelenting fingering. She reaches down to her cunt, placing her lips against her clit. She circles it with her tongue before gently biting down on it, then kissing it as an apology.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s moans become more frequent as Agatha can feel her climax closing in. Body tensing up, things clenching together. Agatha needs to hold them apart with a firm grip.</p><p> </p><p>She begins to crook her fingers inside of Rio, hitting her spot <em> just right </em> - as proven by the moan and the way her body quirks up. </p><p> </p><p>Continuing that same motion, she can feel the way Rio’s body starts to tremble beneath her, back arching and legs tensing.</p><p> </p><p>With a last, loud moan, which would probably wake up everyone in the neighborhood had it not been the middle of the day, Rio comes. Agatha guides her through her orgasm, continuing the movements at a slower pace. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, when Rio’s down from her high, Agatha removes her fingers and mouth, leaning over her with a smirk on her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked beautiful like this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could watch her forever. The ragged rise and fall of her chest along with her shallow breathing. Dark hair spread out on the pillow beneath her, eyelashes fluttering against her upper cheek.</p><p> </p><p>She throws herself onto her side, one arm cradling Rio against the waist as she breathes into her neck, feeling the scent of Rio consume her entirety.</p><p> </p><p>In the aftermath, they both lie there for a second. The outside world closed off, the shared space between them on Rio’s bed was all that mattered in those few minutes.</p><p> </p><p>The beautiful view of Rio on the bed. </p><p> </p><p>The sound of her breaths. </p><p> </p><p>The feeling of her warm skin against Agatha’s. </p><p> </p><p>The taste of Rio still on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>The scent of her perfume against the pillows.</p><p> </p><p>Everything that mattered in that moment. Agatha was trapped in it. Perhaps forever. </p><p> </p><p>Until Rio eventually moves. Her body strength coming back and she climbs on top of Agatha, leaning down to press a long kiss on her lips. Tenderly taking control as she enters her mouth with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>With a confident motion, Rio grabs at the hem Agatha’s pants in an effort to undress her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans into the kiss, but breaks away, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans in annoyance, “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“We should get you cleaned up,” Agatha says, placing her hands on Rio’s hips to move her away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lands on her side with a thud, groaning, “But I wanna help <em> you </em>, now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but still with a hint of delight at Rio’s words. “You whine so much,” She says, trying to sound annoyed but her voice betrays her as she leans over to press a kick peck on Rio’s lips. “In the shower.”</p><p> </p><p>She then promptly turns around to go to the bathroom, before realizing that she doesn’t even know where it is. Halting by the doorway, she turns around and looks at Rio who’s climbing off the bed with effort - her muscles probably still sore from the action just mere minutes ago.</p><p> </p><p>Walking past Agatha with a smirk, she leads her back through the kitchen and into the bathroom. Immediately, she enters the shower and puts it on. The warm water hitting the metallic drain fills the room with a constant sound of clatter. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches as Rio steps into the water, letting it fall on top of her shoulders and run down her tanned skin. She looks up at the showerhead, letting the moment consume her entirely as Agatha can hear a soft moan escaping her parted lips.</p><p> </p><p>With hurried motions, Agatha undresses herself, feeling the goosebumps rise on the skin of her legs as it hits the cold air. </p><p> </p><p>She hastily joins Rio in the shower, hugging her tenderly from behind and kissing along the side of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around, meeting her gaze. For a second, they stand like that - holding each other as the water pools around their feet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is the first to make a move, closing the distance between them and kissing Rio’s wet lips delicately. It turns ugly really fast though, when Agatha brings her hand to the roots of Rio’s hair, pulling at them.</p><p> </p><p>She takes the opportunity of Rio’s newly parted mouth to slide her tongue in, dragging her teeth against her bottom lip to urge them more open.</p><p> </p><p>Rio responds accordingly, licking into Agatha’s mouth with a moan. </p><p> </p><p>The kiss is anything but sweet. It’s raw - teeth and tongues clashing against each other as Agatha forces Rio’s face impossibly close - But most of all, it’s full with yearning, lust and with undeniable affection. </p><p> </p><p>Rio decides to take control, placing her palms against the curve of Agatha’s hips and forcing her back against the tiled wall. </p><p> </p><p>The contrast of Rio’s warm body and the cold tiles send a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio breaks the kiss and starts to instead kiss slowly along Agatha’s jawline, moving down further to her neck and to lastly to her collarbones. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans in frustration, feeling heat rise in her chest; desire. </p><p> </p><p>Like something taking over her every bodily instinct, she grabs Rio’s hair and forces her down. Impatiently needing Rio to actually touch her where she needed it the most.</p><p> </p><p>Rio complies without complaint, lowering herself to her knees on the hard tile floor. Agatha feels a little bad, for a second debating on whether or not they should change location again.</p><p> </p><p>But then Rio places her arm in the hollow of her knee, maneuvering it over her shoulder to keep it steady. The position grants a new access to Agatha’s core.</p><p> </p><p>Without missing a heartbeat, Rio leans in. Slowly licking along Agatha’s folds, smiling as she can feel her wetness gather on her tongue and on her chin. </p><p> </p><p>She circles her clit with a skilled motion of her tongue, sucking gently on if before licking town towards her hole again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivers in the sensation - sure that if she didn’t have Rio’s shoulder to stabilize herself on, she’d fall to the floor. </p><p> </p><p>Rio ignores it, lightly pressing her tongue in before licking up to her clit again and sucking on it steadily.</p><p> </p><p>In response, Agatha lets out a loud moan, muffled by the sound of the water still hitting the drain at a rapid rate.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirks against her, a lewd moan escaping her throat. The sound creates vibrations that spread like electricity through Agatha’s body.</p><p> </p><p>With a gentle hand, Rio starts caressing up along her thigh with slow strokes against her fair skin. Eventually, she reaches Agatha’s cunt, and with a teasing touch she slides her finger between her folds while still continuing her unrelenting movements against her clit with her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moans, both out of frustration and pleasure. She can feel herself getting closer but not close <em> enough </em> - desperately needing Rio’s fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Like she heard her silent pleas, Rio slowly enters her with two fingers. Feeling the walls of Agatha’s cunt closing around her in pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Skillfully, she begins to crook her fingers inside of her in tandem with the unrelenting sucking on her clit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel herself beginning to shake, grabbing Rio’s hair for more stability as her body tenses up. She throws her head back. With her hand in Rio’s hair, she forces Rio’s mouth to add more pressure. Agatha groans up into the ceiling, the water drops hitting her face painting a beautiful, wet canvas.</p><p> </p><p>Rio places one hand on the back of Agatha’s other thigh to help her balance, the slippery floor along with the constant shaking of her legs making it almost impossible to stand on her own.</p><p> </p><p>With a moan, echoing loudly between the bathroom tiles, Agatha comes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio helps her ride it out, continuing her solid movements against her cunt relentlessly. Agatha trembles and almost falls onto the floor as her legs lose their function. Only thing steadying her being the leg bent over Rio’s shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>Rio meets her eyes. Water stroking her every feature and her hair entirely wet. Agatha could moan at the sight - but her throat feels almost raw now, after everything.</p><p> </p><p>When she’s gained back her muscle strength back, she removes her leg and stands up straight, watching as Rio does the same.</p><p> </p><p>“Shouldn’t you be at work?” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha definitely should be, but she couldn’t quite find the reason to. Having Rio here, all to herself in the warmth of each other and the shower, nothing - not even work - felt important anymore.</p><p> </p><p>She huffs, “They can survive a day without me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can they?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs lightly, leaning in to press a fleeting kiss on Rio’s red-tinted lips. “Probably not,” She smirks, moving out of the shower and grabbing a towel. “Can I borrow some clothes?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, completely distracted, as she tries to turn the water off, “Yeah… ehm, my wardrobe is in the bedroom. Grab anything you like.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks and wraps the towel around her before abandoning Rio in the bathroom. She moves with a new confidence across Rio’s flat - having seen most of it already - and into her bedroom again.</p><p> </p><p>The bed is a mess, Agatha looks over at it with a proud smile tugging at her lips. The scene serves as a reminder of what happened earlier. She can feel the excitement rush through her veins - she and Rio are <em> together </em>now. This wasn’t just a one time occurrence that’s gonna be followed by a lot of anxiety or regret.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was hers now.</p><p> </p><p>This was gonna happen again, and again, and <em> again </em>. </p><p> </p><p>She can still feel her stomach twist at the morality of the ordeal, but she couldn’t quite find it in herself to care anymore. Whatever it was they’re doing, wherever this would take them, it was enough for her - in that moment - that Rio was along on the ride. They were in it together now, all of it.</p><p> </p><p>With Rio’s clothes hugging her body, she moves swiftly out to the kitchen, needing the bitter taste of coffee in her mouth as it had become a habit for her around noon.</p><p> </p><p>Rio crosses her path, walking past her with a towel around her body and in her hair. Agatha feels insane, almost wanting a round two immediately at the sight. <em> God </em>she could get used to this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shuffles around the kitchen, looking for coffee and filters. Suddenly, she can feel two familiar hands sneaking their way around her waist. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rests her head on Agatha’s shoulder, watching her measuring the coffee with a light smirk on her face. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans into the touch with a smile, feeling Rio’s body pressed up against her own. </p><p> </p><p>“So do we not tell the team?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels her body freeze, heart sinking. “About what?” She asks instead, trying her best to not postpone this inevitable conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“About us being together,” Rio murmurs, almost whispering into her ear as she slowly plants light kisses along the side of Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has to bite her lip to stop a whimper. But her heart shatters, she doesn't want to fight, not right now. Not after everything. “Can we… not?” She starts carefully, like she’s treading on thin ice, expecting it to shatter at any moment. “I’m not ready for that yet… I think.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a bummer,” Rio sighs against her neck, still continuing her delicate caressing on Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Kinda wanted to brag about bagging by boss,” Rio snickers, “Who’s twelve years older, <em> and </em>hot as fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can feel a slight blush creeping up against her neck at Rio’s words. “You don’t mean that,” she tries, breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh but I do,” Rio smirks against her skin. “I’ve always found you attractive, Agatha. Even from the second I walked into the office on my first day.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is definitely blushing now, she can feel it blooming warm against her cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“I did want to, you know, have sex with you,” She explains. At this point Agatha’s not sure if she’s trying to rile her up - the measuring cup in her hand totally abandoned. “But I waited.”</p><p> </p><p>“For three years?” Agatha asks, not quite believing the story.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I mean,” Rio retreats, “You did make it <em> very </em>obvious you weren’t interested. So I dropped it… for a long time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods. That adds up.</p><p> </p><p>She remembers the continuous and unrelenting flirting that Rio would do at the beginning, three years ago. How she’d give compliments in weird times, walking into her private office unannounced without any real reason to. </p><p> </p><p>At the time, she thought that was just Rio’s personality all the time. Well, it is - but not to that extent. She hadn’t realised that until Rio suddenly stopped. At the time, Agatha was relieved and didn’t read into it.</p><p> </p><p>Now it all made sense. </p><p> </p><p>“But you’re so hot at the office,” Rio continues, teasingly. “Ordering people around, walking with your back straight and head held high like you own the place."</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I kinda do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckles against her skin, “So <em> commanding </em>, all the time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirks. At least <em> someone </em>appreciates her attitude. “You love it, though.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Rio admits. With a swift motion she turns Agatha around, now standing with their lips dangerously close to each other, sharing the air between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha sighs, stopping Rio from leaning in, “I need coffee.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans, “Is it really <em> that </em>important?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha sighs, turning around. She needed to stop herself right now before this turned into an infinite loop.</p><p> </p><p>“Can it really not wait?” Rio asks, desire dripping off every word.</p><p> </p><p>“C’mon,” She lewds, “You love it, the anticipation.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans but removes her arms from Agatha’s waist, “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhales, proud of herself for actually gathering enough self-restraint to actually hold back. Although she kind of regretted it now, feeling the memory of Rio’s lips almost slipping away. </p><p> </p><p>Almost.</p><p> </p><p>She can hear the sound of Rio’s footsteps growing fainter as she walks away, out of the kitchen and into what Agatha presumed was the living room - she hadn’t been there yet.</p><p> </p><p>Impatiently, she drums her fingers against the countertop, waiting for the coffee maker to finish. Which takes longer than she would like it to.</p><p> </p><p>As if the small task would make time go faster, she searches in the cabinets for Rio’s mugs. She finds them in the one right above the kitchen sink and places them on the counter. </p><p> </p><p>When the machine stops and the sound dies down, she could hear the silent humming of a tune from inside the, alleged, living room. It makes a smile appear on her face, she hadn’t heard Rio’s consistent noise making in a few weeks - probably because she hadn’t been comfortable enough around Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Now she was.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had grown to miss it, the constant noise coming from Rio. Whether it be humming, whistling or talking, that woman was always making a sound. </p><p> </p><p>At the office, Agatha had at first found it annoying. Disturbing, even. But now, when she was standing in the kitchen, she couldn’t find it in herself to mind it. Almost finding comfort in it. </p><p> </p><p>Afraid she was gonna kill Rio’s moment, she lingers in the kitchen for a tad longer than she needs to. That is, until she can’t stand it anymore, needing the presence of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Earlier, she had been afraid to admit it, even to herself, but now it had become clear - she liked Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Yet, she wouldn’t go as far as loved, because that felt like an entirely new step that she wasn’t ready for.</p><p> </p><p>But she allowed herself to feel the warmth and the content that she’d always, somehow, felt in Rio’s presence. She had denied it even to herself at the beginning - hell, even up until just mere hours ago. </p><p> </p><p>The relief of <em> allowance </em> made her more relaxed. Even if those invisible boundaries and rules had been implanted by herself, they’d been weighing her down. A weight that was now suddenly lifted. </p><p> </p><p>The feelings crash over her like a tidal wave, overwhelming but at the same time somehow relieving. As if, in a way, a mental latch had been removed - leaving her alone to confront her own feelings. </p><p> </p><p>She’d never been great at that. </p><p> </p><p>But she was willing to try - if not for herself, then for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who was now lying down on the living room couch as Agatha enters with two cups in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>She takes a second in the doorway to admire the decorations. It was beautiful, homey and small. Extravagant but laid back. It was everything Rio is. </p><p> </p><p>Beautiful paintings covered the main wall, towering over the couch. Like all the other rooms in Rio’s apartment, this one had plants and flowers climbing up the edges of the window. Flower pots crowding the surface beneath the lower frame. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, planted on the couch, completed the picture fully. She fitted right in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went to sit down, placing the two cups down on the wooden coffee table. Rio was laying spread out across the entire couch, making it impossible for Agatha to sit down unless she was gonna crush her legs entirely. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gives a playful smile when Agatha glares at her, but evidently bends her knees to make space.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits down, relaxing into the soft cushions with a sigh. Without missing a heartbeat, Rio places her legs in her lap. The action is oddly familiar to what happened during their “movie-night” mere weeks ago. </p><p> </p><p>But this time, Agatha relaxes into it. She doesn't tense up, like she’d done last time, unsure of what to do in response. Instead, she places her palms with a gentle confidence against Rio’s lower legs, finding comfort in how welcome the action feels. This time, it didn’t feel weird or out of place, like a crossed boundary.</p><p> </p><p>This time, it feels natural.</p><p> </p><p>“Should we watch something?” Rio suggests, grabbing the remote and turning on the tv.</p><p> </p><p>“What would you want to watch?” Like always, Agatha is weary when it comes to someone else choosing, being very picky and usually sticking to her own tv-shows. But today, she felt like she kind of owed it to Rio to put up with it. No matter what it was.</p><p> </p><p>“Killing eve,” Rio says proudly, “I think you’d like it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans. She’d heard about that show a lot, but she’d never bothered to start it. “Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio exclaims happily, turning on episode one. “If you don’t like it after the first episode we can stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunts, but leans back and places her focus on the tv. She can give it one chance. <em> One.  </em></p><p> </p><p>“But we might have to break up,” Rio states firmly. </p><p> </p><p>For a second, Agatha’s scared she’s serious. And honestly, it wouldn’t even surprise her anymore. But one glance at the smug smile on Rio’s lips is enough to prove her wrong.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah yeah, we’ll see.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles in response, “You’ll love it.”</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p>Agatha had, in fact, loved it. For the rest of the afternoon, they binged the entire first season, completely invested in the story. With only a few breaks to grab more coffee, water and one makeout session on the couch.<em>   </em></p><p> </p><p>There was a domestic feeling over the entire situation. Watching tv, completely content with each other’s presence. Agatha loved it. She could get lost in it forever.</p><p> </p><p>“We should probably cook dinner,” Rio states when the credits rolled for the last episode, “It’s almost 7 pm.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up abruptly, “Is it?” Having not checked the time since almost noon, this threw her off entirely.</p><p> </p><p>At first, her plan was to go home about two hours ago. Not that she didn’t want to spend time with Rio, but she also didn’t want to overstay her welcome, which she was certain she was about to do. </p><p> </p><p>She, herself, could spend days in Rio’s company. She felt comfortable in it now. If Rio allowed her, she would probably never leave this apartment.</p><p> </p><p>“We can order if you want,” Rio says, standing up and stretching, “I don’t really have the energy to cook right now, anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabs the two mugs that were still placed on the coffee table, and starts walking towards the kitchen. “I wouldn’t want to overstay my welcome,” she says over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Rio catches up to her in the kitchen, “That’s impossible.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles but hides it when bending down to place the cups in the dishwasher, “Oh?” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re always welcome, Agatha,” Rio says, watching her from the other side of the kitchen. “Don’t… Go home. Please?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stands up, completely frozen for a second. She didn’t expect that, at all. “I won’t,” she reassures instead, walking over to Rio and brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, “I’m not finished with you yet.” </p><p> </p><p>With those words, she starts kissing slowly down the side of Rio’s neck. Sucking and biting slightly as she makes her way to her pulse point. Rio whimpers at the contact, and Agatha can practically <em> see </em>the shiver run down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>“We need to eat, Agatha,” Rio states breathlessly.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t it wait?” Agatha smirks against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio places her hands on Agatha’s chest to move her away, “What do you want to eat?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her with a disappointed expression. She was hungry, sure. But wasn’t the built up tension for six hours enough - can’t the goddamn food <em> wait </em>for just an hour?</p><p> </p><p>“Thai?” Agatha asks, defeated, “I would kill for some spring rolls.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods and picks up her phone, “I’m game.”<br/><br/></p><p align="center">______</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The next morning, Agatha wakes up in a panic. </p><p> </p><p>In the tumult of everything that went down last night, they’d forgotten to set an alarm for this morning. She could still feel how sore the muscles in her body are, even when lying down. </p><p> </p><p>Her mouth was dry, her hair a mess and her lips felt swollen. Her entire body aching with the memories of yesterday.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still sleeping soundly in her arms. That was a new discovery for Agatha - apparently, she was a cuddler. She’d never been before. But yet again, there’s a lot of things that she hadn’t done before Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Sleeping in being one of them.</p><p> </p><p>She wakes Rio up in a panic when checking the time on her phone, 7:30 am. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio! Rio!” She shakes her awake, “We need to be at the office in 30 minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio makes some inaudible sounds in response, Agatha shakes her more. “We <em> need </em>to go.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio asks, mumbling in her sleep.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha exclaims, annoyed, “Get up!”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Rio whines, but sits up and rubs her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re gonna be late,” Agatha states, quickly moving out of bed and looking around the room for her own clothes. Thankfully, she’d gathered them all last night and thrown them over an armchair placed in the corner. They’d been scattered across the entire apartment after yesterday.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, remains seated in the bed, the white covers covering her naked body. Agatha <em> really </em>wants to skip work today too, but that would cross the line. </p><p> </p><p>She also knew that it was risky, walking into the office with the clothes she’d worn yesterday. But what would be even riskier was to walk in wearing Rio’s clothes. So, hopefully, no one would notice.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” She warns, “We need to go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t we just… call in sick.”</p><p> </p><p>“We were both absent yesterday, if we’re not there today people will start suspecting stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio removes the covers, revealing her naked body but not caring at all, and walks over to her dresser to put on some clothes, “You’re overestimating our team.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe, but Billy is already on our ass,” Agatha explains, sighing in frustration.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you not to worry about him,” Rio says, closing the distance between them and hugging her from behind, placing her chin upon her shoulder and breathing in the scent of Agatha’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, Rio’s presence working wonders to calm her down, “I know. I’m just… worried. I guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be,” Rio says, calming her down further as she presses her lips against the crook of Agatha’s neck soothingly. “They’ll find out, but they don’t have to do it yet. We can keep it to ourselves for a while longer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha smiles, turning around and kissing her gently on the lips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiles into the kiss, bringing her arms around Agatha’s neck to deepen it further. </p><p> </p><p>In that moment, it’s as if time freezes entirely. Nothing existing outside of their shared space in that bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>But the over looming dread of their tardiness is enough for Agatha to reluctantly pull away. “We need to hurry up,” she whispers against Rio’s lips. Hating herself for interrupting the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans but removes her arms, grabbing a shirt from the drawer and swiftly pulling it over her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches, unable to drag her eyes away from Rio’s body. She couldn’t believe Rio was <em> hers </em>now. It all felt too surreal. </p><p> </p><p>A few minutes later, they’re out the door. </p><p> </p><p>Breathing the cold morning air calms Agatha down for a second. Having had no breakfast nor morning coffee, she felt irritable. But Rio by her side was grounding as they walked with quick steps along the gray pavements. </p><p> </p><p>They were still late, but with each block they passed Agatha calmed down a little - they might be on time afterall.</p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes, she can feel Rio’s hand slide into her own. A warm sensation against the cool air. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s first instinct was to shake her off dismissively and put her hand in her pocket for warmth. But the touch was soft, Rio’s hands fitting perfectly in her own.</p><p> </p><p>She drags her thumb over Rio’s knuckles, as if she’s counting them. </p><p> </p><p>A few moments later, just mere minutes before 8 am, they enter the office glass doors. Still holding hands.</p><p> </p><p>It had become such a familiar feeling now that none of them reacted to it, or even thought that they should probably <em> let go </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Because it felt so natural, to have Rio’s hand in hers, that Agatha doesn’t even realize it’s there until it’s too late. Walking into the office hand in hand, she doesn’t think about it until she sees her team members, all sitting in the conference room.</p><p> </p><p>The approach of Rio and Agatha had turned everyone’s attention. They were all sitting in their usual seats, chatting away when everything got quiet. </p><p> </p><p>With panic, Agatha removes her hand from Rio’s and straightens her back, “Good morning.”</p><p> </p><p>She <em> knew </em>how weird this looked.</p><p> </p><p>Walking in late for the first time ever - together with Rio, who’s also never late. </p><p> </p><p>Wearing the same clothes as yesterday.</p><p> </p><p>Holding hands, for god's sake. That <em> has </em>to be cherry on top. Nothing could ever beat the obviousness of that.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to shake it off, maybe the other team members didn’t read too much into it. <em> Maybe </em> they didn’t even see them holding hands as they walked in.</p><p> </p><p>With this delusion, Agatha walks over to her place at the top of the table, sitting down and shaking her head to stop her mind from spinning out of control.</p><p> </p><p>She could see Rio, sitting with a sly smirk on her face from across the table. But underneath that, she saw something else, a worry, almost an apologetic expression. Agatha knew she had been so quick to blame Rio during earlier mishaps, but she wouldn’t today.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t deserve it.</p><p> </p><p>“So…” Agatha clears her throat, “Shall we begin to go over this new case again, since Vidal wasn’t present yesterday we might need a recap.”</p><p> </p><p>She can see Rio wince, making her feel bad for a second. But Rio also knew why she did it, she can’t go around being favorable to colleagues - even if they are together. </p><p> </p><p><em> Especially </em>, if they are together, actually.</p><p> </p><p>“I need to say something first,” Billy states, standing up and catching everybody by surprise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, not really bothered to hear whatever bullshit he was gonna spit out. “Go ahead,” She says with an urging wave of her hand, leaning back into her chair, ready to be entertained.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha and Rio.” Billy starts, looking between the both of them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glares at him, not knowing where this is going, but not wanting to find out, either. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry if I fucked up your relationship by getting in the way. It’s cool, by the way, I support you entirely. I just wasn’t sure when I asked you about it last week, Agatha. I never meant to compromise anything,” Billy blurts out quickly, before taking a deep breath and sitting down again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at him, completely baffled by the statement - the boldness in it.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Jen asks, confused. Looking around the room as if she was gonna find the answer to the question.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy,” Rio warns, throwing him an angry look.</p><p> </p><p>“I just wanted to say I support your relationship… is all.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans. They were <em> so close </em>to the finish line and when he fucked it all up. Jen clearly didn’t know, and judging by the look of surprise on Lilia: she didn’t either.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brings her head into her hands, tugging nervously at the roots, before looking over at Rio. She too looked completely bewildered.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait…” Jen asks, her eyes wandering between Rio and Agatha, “You’re together?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighs heavily, bracing for impact.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, yes we are.”</p><p> </p>
