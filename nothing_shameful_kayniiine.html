<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">“An Irish Car Bomb? Are you sure? I don’t want you puking in my shrubs again.”</p><p dir="ltr">A soft sigh left Rio Vidal’s lips as she gave the rebuttal some consideration. The bartender, a thin and pointed woman named Jen with her pressed lips and piercing gaze, only wanted to save herself the hassle of explaining why there was vomit in the bushes to other customers, but Rio wanted to get <em>hammered</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been a long day of OddJobs Rio picked up from the app, not limited to: two college apartment deep cleans – after a party, so the fee went up to $150 a piece – three bouts of dog walking, and a cage cleaning run that took her two hours (where she only threw up one time).</p><p dir="ltr">She needed the relief.</p><p dir="ltr">The quickest route to getting drunk, she knew, was a shot of Bailey’s dropped into a nice tall glass of Guinness, chugged down before the Bailey’s had a chance to curdle.</p><p dir="ltr">It was also the quickest way to make Rio vomit on an empty stomach.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fine, have it your way,” she sighed, clearly defeated.</p><p dir="ltr">“A double Beam would do you better anyway.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright. A double shot of Beam for me, then.”</p><p dir="ltr">A slight sneer of a chuckle left the other woman as she turned to the bar behind her and set about preparing Rio’s drink. Just over her shoulder, Rio caught her own reflection in the mirror.</p><p dir="ltr">Lord have mercy, she looked like absolute shit.</p><p dir="ltr">Her dark hair was tied up in a bun that if called messy, would have been underselling it. Around her head was a green bandana folded perfectly and tied at the top, Rosie-the-Riveter-esque in nature.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>We Can Do It!</em></p><p dir="ltr">It flashed through Rio’s mind, sparking a mostly inaudible laugh as she met her eyes in the mirror.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah fucking right.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t do anything.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a lie, of course, but after a month of trying to claim extra cash through an app, Rio wasn’t even close to putting a dent in the fourteen thousand dollars she needed to pay off for her final year of university.</p><p dir="ltr">Losing financial aid in the last stretch always felt like a gut punch to anyone, but to Rio?</p><p dir="ltr">Going back to college after 30 was hard on those who dared to try. It was even harder when you had to scramble to pay for it. The “discrepancy” they claimed on her forms for that year was complete bullshit, but she was two months into the appeals process with nothing to show for it.</p><p dir="ltr">So she cleaned up after frat parties and walked dogs and scrubbed shit out of animal cages to at least <em>attempt</em> to be proactive in showing she wanted to finish her course, no matter what it took.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio was tired.</p><p dir="ltr">She just wanted to drink, to watch the fùtbol match on the television above the bar, and then stumble back to her tiny ass flat to shower, crawl into bed, and repeat the process on a Sunday.</p><p dir="ltr">As Jen slid the glass across the bar to Rio, there was an arrogance in her voice as she held out her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“Give me your card. We both know you’re starting a tab.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Predictable, am I?” Rio asked, her half-laugh almost sounding defensive.</p><p dir="ltr">“As the setting sun, darling,” Jen cooed before she turned away to ring Rio up.</p><p dir="ltr">She was right, though. She almost always was.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time she had shot five and six in the palm of her hand, Rio felt <em>good.</em> She forgot her bones ached and her muscles felt as if they had been pulled taut. She forgot about how badly her throat hurt after her little vomiting session. She forgot about how outside of her goals to be a biochemist, her life fucking sucked.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, Rio forgot about almost anything that wasn’t the ARSENAL - 2, MAN CITY - 1 on the bottom of the television screen to a point that she was actually oblivious as someone took the seat next to her at the bar top.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re looking a little green around the gills, dollface.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was so loud as it came from beside her, though it was certainly spoken not shouted. As Rio’s attention turned, she was not exactly sure who would say something so out of place, but she was even more surprised to see the source.</p><p dir="ltr">Next to her sat a beautiful woman, probably a little older than she was, with sharp features and the bluest eyes Rio was sure she’d ever seen. She hadn’t ever seen the woman around before, but it became clear by Jen’s greeting that she might have been a semi-permanent fixture in the bar.</p><p dir="ltr">“Harkness,” she greeted gruffly, pacing to stand in front of where the other woman sat. “Didn’t think you’d be back from Timbuktu so soon.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, Jenny. It was just Massachusetts. Told you I’d be back right quick.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, well,” Jen huffed. “I was hoping you were wrong.”</p><p dir="ltr">The woman beside Rio let out a snort, following it up with laughter a second later.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then who would drink up all your Jameson? And over-tip you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t be right, Harkness. I hate it when that happens,” Jen called over her shoulder as she set about preparing the woman’s drink.</p><p dir="ltr">“And who might you be?” the woman questioned. When Rio peeled her eyes off of Jen’s form and turned to look beside her, she was just drunk enough to believe the moment they made eye contact, the woman was looking right into her damn soul.</p><p dir="ltr">“M-Me?” Rio stammered, suddenly feeling very put on the spot. “I’m nobody.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Smooth, you fucking idiot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">There was this beautiful woman asking her name (a beautiful woman with a sharp smile and dangerous eyes and cascading and soft brown hair, wearing a smart sweater and slacks that looked expensive) and Rio was sitting there acting like that attention didn’t matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, it mattered alright, but Rio was almost certain she was too drunk to flirt with any kind of tact.</p><p dir="ltr">“Now that’s not true,” the woman admonished, fiddling with a coaster as she danced it around on its side. “I’ve seen you here before, but you’re usually cozy in the corner with someone else, not up here.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Well. That was her being called out, wasn’t it?</p><p dir="ltr">How could she be nobody if this woman noticed her several times before?</p><p dir="ltr">“My name’s Rio,” she offered just before she drowned it with a wash of the alcohol.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi, Rio,” the woman cooed. It felt antagonistic, but something about it also felt weirdly flirty in a way that caused Rio’s inebriated brain to fumble. “I’m Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha. Agatha Harkness.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio heard whispers of her here and there around town; she was a quirky woman who liked to snarl at passers by who stared too long. She ran her business out of her too-large house, selling things like hexes and love spells on line to the people stupid enough to believe she had any power backing her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic wasn’t real, but people sure thought Agatha was.</p><p dir="ltr">A <em>real</em> piece of work.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio was neither here nor there when it came to listening to idle gossip; frankly, she didn’t actually care. She was too worried about scraping up every penny possible to pay for her furthered education so she could actually <em>be </em>someone by the time she was forty. Unfortunate circumstances kept her from early college life, but she was bound and determined to make up for it.</p><p dir="ltr">If she could manage to fucking pay for it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi Agatha,” Rio returned sardonically, taking another drink from her glass. She was almost sure she was going to need it to put up with whatever banter <em>Agatha</em> was going to be trying to throw her way.</p><p dir="ltr">“So, what brings you in?” she drawled, shifting her attention only when Jen appeared with not one, but two glasses filled with double shots of Jameson.</p><p dir="ltr">Damn. Agatha was no lightweight.</p><p dir="ltr">It still didn’t exactly explain why she was trying to talk to Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">Did she notice every time she saw Rio in the corner that it was with a different woman? Did she notice it was only on the weekends and Wednesday nights when she had the tiniest slivers of free time? More importantly: did she actually give a shit?</p><p dir="ltr">“Long day,” Rio mused, finishing off her drink before sliding it across the bar. Jen caught the movement and strutted down the bar, swiping the glass off.</p><p dir="ltr">“Closing out?” she asked tightly, probably preferring it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course not,” Rio answered with a soured expression. “Another double please.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio, I swear to God, if you–”</p><p dir="ltr">“Relaaaaax, Jen. I’m not going to puke. And if I do, I’ll hold it til I get home.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What if you don’t end up going home?” came a question from beside her.</p><p dir="ltr">She was drunk, yes, but… <em>What?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Was this woman skipping straight past small talk to insinuate that she wanted to fuck? It wasn’t the craziest encounter Rio ever had, but it was certainly a wild suggestion to make given the fact they <em>barely</em> just officially learned one another’s names.</p><p dir="ltr">“Where else would I go?” Rio asked dumbly, trying to downplay the fact that she was still of her wits enough to know what Agatha was insinuating.</p><p dir="ltr">“Would you want to go anywhere else?” It was a calm question, but it was followed by 3 gulps of the entire contents of one glass.</p><p dir="ltr">What a fucking woman.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s ten at night on a Saturday and most of my peers are at least a decade younger than me. I’m too old for parties and as you can see, I am quite unoccupied in terms of my attention… Hence this conversation.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Shit. No! That wasn’t what she meant!</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of becoming combative or offended, the woman next to her simply laughed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, so if someone else was here you wouldn’t give me the time of day?” Agatha asked coolly. Her tone was calm, but there was a twisting of her lips that read as quite thrilled. She put Rio on the spot, and gave her the opening to determine which way things were going to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could agree and be an asshole just to prove a point… <em>Or</em>, she could test the waters a bit and try her hand at drunkenly flirting.</p><p dir="ltr">Option two sounded like more fun.</p><p dir="ltr">“Looking like that? I can’t make any promises,” Rio shot back, a smirk filling her face before it was washed away with what was equivalent to her seventh shot of the night.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck it. Why not? In any and all regard.</p><p dir="ltr">“This old thing?” Agatha prodded, plucking at the neck of her tight black sweater. As Rio’s gaze dropped down to her chest, she could very blatantly see that Agatha was not wearing a bra, at least judging by the pair of stiff nipples pressed against the fabric. “Thought it was a bit chilly out tonight. Figured it might help keep me warm.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Isn’t the only thing that could.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh.</p><p dir="ltr">Whoops.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn’t supposed to leave the house.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh? And might you have some helpful suggestions?”</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck. Ten minutes before, Rio was ready to drink herself to passing out and make Jen drive her up to her flat. It wasn’t like it was a common occurrence, but she knew Jen would be too annoyed at the idea of leaving her there to not commit.</p><p dir="ltr">Right then, she had an opportunity. She could cap it at eight shots and go home with this beautiful woman who apparently kept tabs on her sometimes or she could go home alone. It was painfully obvious which option sounded better.</p><p dir="ltr">“I could think of a few,” Rio offered with a snort. When she was finished downing the last of her liquor, she knew she was in trouble. She might have been fine at six, or even seven, but eight shots was going to put her under. Not quite puking, but holy shit was she drunk. To remedy this, Agatha took her shot.</p><p dir="ltr">“Get her two waters, would you? Need her of sound mind enough to say yes and mean it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Jen grimaced behind the bar, her tongue lolling out in disgust. “Harkness. Leave the poor girl alone.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey!” Rio clipped, her head snapping up in defense. It made her vision swoon slightly, but she recovered quick enough it went unnoticed. “<em>I’m</em> flirting with <em>her,</em> thank you very much!”</p><p dir="ltr">Beside her, Agatha preened with a glow of triumph as her eyes locked with Jen’s. “I refuse to let chivalry die, alright?!” It was bullshit and even Rio’s drunk mind knew as much, but she appreciated the humor, and the obvious need for clear consent.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen dutifully slid two glasses of water across the bar to land them directly in front of Rio, nodding toward them for emphasis.</p><p dir="ltr">“Drink. Both. You’re not leaving otherwise. With her or alone.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio. I know it’s not my general shtick to give a shit about who goes home with who in my bar, but…” Her gaze sliced to Agatha. “Wouldn’t want you doing anything you’d regret in the morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey! I take offense!”</p><p dir="ltr">“As was intended.” Jen walked away, surely to clean some glasses or mind her own business; Rio knew she was trying to be helpful, but…</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of going home alone and hoping at least <em>one </em>of her toys was charged was pretty pathetic. Even drunk, she knew going home with this woman and having a romp or two around the sheets would be <em>way </em>more fun than anything she could come up with on her own.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was not out of practice by any means, but it was safe to say that Jen might have had a better idea than she did of what she might be getting herself into with one Agatha Harkness. At the same time, Rio wasn’t really sure she cared. This would likely be a one-off, something they would get out of their systems and then go their separate ways. After all, it wasn’t like their paths had crossed too noticeably before to a point where it might make things awkward if they kept showing up at the same bar while of the mind to fuck other people.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just sex.</p><p dir="ltr">Something fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Something to keep her busy and save her from the depthless despair of being alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Without another word, Rio chugged half of one glass, not even caring as some of it leaked out the side and dribbled down her chin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Woah there, slugger, you’re losing hottie points,” Agatha chided at her side but as she lowered the glass and their eyes met, she knew Agatha was simply being facetious. They were going to fuck no matter what shenanigans she pulled in the time it took her to drink both glasses of water. They both knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you kidding me?” Rio shot back, “I look like <em>this</em>,” she emphasized with a wave of her hand to indicate her sweat-soaked cut-off shirt and loose basketball shorts, all topped off with the mess of hair somehow wrangled atop her head. “And me chugging some water is going to lose me ‘hottie points?’ You’re fucking with me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe, had she not been so intoxicated, she wouldn’t have called Agatha out so plainly, but what was the harm? It was clear they were both interested, so if Agatha happened to march right out of there cause Rio dished some sass right back at her? At least <em>one </em>of those toys had to be charged, right?</p><p dir="ltr">“I am,” Agatha agreed with a dangerous grin. She cleared the second shot glass and waved a hand in Jen’s direction, first failing and then succeeding as she stood on the stool to lean over and exaggerate the movement of her arm.</p><p dir="ltr">“I see you, Harkness. I’m ignoring you. God, aren’t you like forty? Why do you act like this?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Because I’m young at heart, Jenny. One more before the road. I figure I might get close to catching up with her. Makes things more titillating if you ask me!” Agatha laughed mostly to herself as she lowered into the chair again and drummed her fingertips atop the bar.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio watched her for a long moment, even though Agatha was clearly diverting her attention elsewhere in an attempt to look disinterested. She already blew that out of the water, hadn’t she? This was all because of her forward push and now, Rio didn’t want to stunt the speed with which they were beginning to roll. She personally was trying to sober up minutely while Agatha was trying her hardest to play catch-up. Whatever the night held for them, the chances it ended comically were increasing exponentially.</p><p dir="ltr">With one last drink beneath her belt, Agatha pushed the barstool back with a godawful screech and gleefully hopped off it, swaying only slightly once both feet were planted on the ground. When she turned to face Rio, it was as she was downing the last of her second glass of water.</p><p dir="ltr">“You ready then?” Agatha asked triumphantly, clearly having gotten exactly what she wanted in Rio’s sobering up.</p><p dir="ltr">“Where are we even going?” Rio questioned, swiveling to the side so she could slide to her feet. Once righted, she swooned forward just enough that both of Agatha’s hands hooked firmly around her biceps, catching her in place but with their faces only a breath apart.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey now, no PDA,” she chastised, lightly pushing Rio toward a rightness on her own feet. For just a moment, Agatha held on. She looked at her, looked at her hard, and then posed a soft question. “Do you want to go home with me, Rio?”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a choice. Rio could say no. She <em>could</em> <em>absolutely </em>say no. She <em>should probably</em> have said no.</p><p dir="ltr">But she didn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes. Yes, Agatha. I want to go home with you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s phone dinged from her pocket and she grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Good. Our ride’s here.”</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t exactly have any expectation that she would be kissing Agatha that night, even if they’d played their little game, made their arrangements and climbed into the back of a rideshare. So when Agatha reached across them and dragged her fingers down the slope of Rio’s jaw, pulling her in to brush their lips softly together, she was almost certain she was hallucinating it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you actually kissing me?” she whispered, though she didn’t stop it from happening.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can stop if you want,” Agatha told her in a murmur, inciting panic.</p><p dir="ltr">That was the absolute mother fucking <em>last </em>thing Rio wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">“Please don’t,” she whimpered rather pathetically. Maybe she wasn’t expecting it – after all, Rio had fucked quite a few women without ever kissing them – but the moment she had it, she didn’t want to let it go.</p><p dir="ltr">“I won’t.”</p><p dir="ltr">And Agatha kept her word.</p><p dir="ltr">At least, she kept her word until the rideshare driver told them to get the fuck out of his car and called them ‘hapless lesbians.’</p><p dir="ltr">Not wrong, but at least neither of them vomited in his car.</p><p dir="ltr">It took little time for Agatha to punch in the code to her front door, leading Rio inside with a rough tug on her hand. The moment she was far enough inside to be missed by the forcefully swinging wood, Agatha slammed the door shut and shoved Rio’s back against it, pressing their lips together with as much force as she used to pin their hips together.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tell me you want to be mine tonight,” Agatha growled, tearing away to place kisses along the length of Rio’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tonight, Agatha Harkness, I am yours.”</p><p> </p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This is fast burn sexually. It's a pornstar fic. There WILL likely be smut every other chapter. It's... important to the plot, you know?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Sex with strangers was always dicey in terms of physical chemistry, at least in Rio’s experience (and she had plenty of shit experiences in the past in such a regard) but in the times it was right? It was <em>really fucking right. </em>Like <em>so</em> right it almost hurt.</p><p dir="ltr">Pinned to the front door of Agatha Harkness’ too-big, too-empty, too-showy house, Rio already knew which way the pendulum was set to swing.</p><p dir="ltr">This was right. Right as rain. Right as could be.</p><p dir="ltr">Even better was the way Agatha’s hand snaked beneath the open side of her cut-off and wound around to plant firmly in the small of her back. It was a tight fit between her sweat-crusted skin and the pressure of the door behind her, but it felt so damn good to be held that way. Agatha didn’t know her, and she did not know Agatha, but that didn’t matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Not really.</p><p dir="ltr">Not when they could have each other.</p><p dir="ltr">The kiss Agatha initiated was a little sloppy, but Rio was truthfully way too drunk to care. She couldn’t actually give a shit about the malignments of their lips or the way their tongues were too out of sync to be normally enjoyable when she felt like she was caught in Agatha’s trap and Agatha was not going to let her get away.</p><p dir="ltr">There was not a single fact about Agatha in Rio’s mind that would have tainted her opinion or given any preconceived notions that might have soured her outlook. Instead, the facts – or, rather, rumors around town – were that Agatha was alone, she was mean, she did her own thing, and she liked pissing people off. She kept her distance and generally rubbed people the wrong way, but…</p><p dir="ltr">As her hand wedged lower, fingertips tucking into the waist of Rio’s shorts where it rested just above her ass, Agatha was rubbing her in every single <em>right</em> way imaginable.</p><p dir="ltr">Being touched was one thing. Plenty of people had touched Rio, and Rio had touched just as many in return.</p><p dir="ltr">What Agatha was doing was not just <em>touching. </em>Agatha was <em>feeling.</em> Her fingertips were pressured and curious as they danced their way lower still to the supple and full flesh of Rio’s asscheek. She kept going, clearly making herself uncomfortable with the way her knuckles braced against the wood, but finally got to the point where the entirety of her palm cupped happily at skin and pulled.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a strange sensation to Rio’s drunken brain; there was no actual breeze and yet as Agatha lightly exposed her even the tiniest bit beneath her basketball shorts and boyshort underwear caused her to gasp into their kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sensitive, are we?” Agatha hummed in delight just before she bit down hard on Rio’s bottom lip, drawing a different sound this time – a squeal.</p><p dir="ltr">“Just really horny,” Rio attempted to refute, but it was pointless. Agatha was clearly pleased with the reaction, so why even try to act like there was an excuse for it?</p><p dir="ltr">“You always a horny drunk?” Agatha managed against her skin as she kissed along her jaw and gave another rough tug on her handful of flesh, a sigh drawn instead of a gasp that time.</p><p dir="ltr">“I go to that bar to pick up women, of course I’m a horny drunk,” Rio shot back. At the same time, she tried to arch off the door but Agatha was quick to assert herself with her hips as a lock, holding Rio in place. “Fuck!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Guess it was my turn to do the picking up then, hm?” Agatha chimed quietly, her lips latching onto the lobe of Rio’s ear only a second before she followed them with her teeth. “I knew you wouldn’t turn me down. Not even if you were sober.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I–! Oh!” Rio attempted, but was silenced when Agatha’s teeth sank delectably into her neck. “I didn’t know who you were. I… <em>oh, mmm</em>… I’ve seen you, and I’ve heard about you, but I didn’t connect the two.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was an honest admission, though Rio’s bourbon-logged brain was wondering why they were fucking talking about how many times they’d spotted one another from across a room.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do I have a reputation to uphold then?” The tip of Agatha’s tongue punctuated the question as it laved over the gentle dental impressions in Rio’s skin.</p><p dir="ltr">“You have an impression to make.”</p><p dir="ltr">Every carnival bell in Rio’s head sounded at once with the way Agatha shoved her back flat against the door with one hand before dropping it level with the other to scoop Rio by the backs of her thighs. She was off her feet in an instant – something Rio was thankful for. She was not only drunk-drunk, but within the last three minutes, she’d become pretty damn Agatha-drunk too.</p><p dir="ltr">The lust, the desire, the physical attention were all so intoxicating in their own right and Rio couldn’t get enough.</p><p dir="ltr">“I want you,” came a grunt just below her chin. She tipped her head down to find Agatha staring up at her, hungry blue eyes burning with demand.</p><p dir="ltr">“I told you,” Rio spoke, leaving one hand on Agatha’s shoulder as the other cupped her jaw, “tonight, I’m yours.” She put a very loud exclamation point on the end of her sentence in the form of a deep and devouring kiss, starved and drunk in its delivery. Before she even pulled their lips apart, Agatha was moving and heading straight toward the stairs.</p><p dir="ltr">It should have been muscle memory for Agatha, an easy trip to her room, but they were both failing to take something important into account:</p><p dir="ltr">They were both trashed.</p><p dir="ltr">Hammered.</p><p dir="ltr">Wasted.</p><p dir="ltr">Shit-faced.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did a fantastic job the first two steps, climbing them with ease. The third step was a different story entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Her toe caught on the lip of the stair, and for a split second, Rio saw the abject terror spark across her face like a bolt of lightning.</p><p dir="ltr">She had no hands to catch herself and from where she was fastened around Agatha’s waist, Rio was all but useless.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment two stairs slammed into her back along different points, a guttural and pained groan was shoved from Rio’s lungs along with every last bit of air she had. It wasn’t the most painful experience Rio had endured, but it was enough to knock the breath right out of her.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Fuuuuuuuuu-</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio! Rio! I’m so sorry!” Agatha half-slurred as she pushed herself up in a panic to look over the woman below her. “Are you okay?”</p><p dir="ltr">Even intoxicated, Rio could hear the genuine concern in the other woman’s words. While it didn’t exactly fucking tickle, she was truthfully no worse for wear. She might have two very horizontal and well placed bruises for the next few weeks, but right then the alcohol she’d consumed earlier in the night was enough to dull it for the time being.</p><p dir="ltr">“M’fine,” she groaned. Despite the sound of her voice, she made a valiant effort to lock her arms around Agatha’s neck and secured her legs in their previous position around Agatha’s waist. “But you for sure have to carry me the rest of the way now.”</p><p dir="ltr">A relieved chuckle passed through slightly parted lips as Agatha gave a nod. “I guess I owe you that much,” she mused, grunting her way through the second half of her statement as she miraculously managed to rock back to her feet, rising to full height with Rio still wrapped around her like a sloth.</p><p dir="ltr">This was stupid.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not sexy in the slightest.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, as Agatha carried her up the stairs and only stopped so she could press her back to the hallway wall and plant a haphazard but desperate kiss to her lips, Rio was practically crawling out of her skin.</p><p dir="ltr">She just wanted to be naked and in turn, she wanted Agatha to be naked as well.</p><p dir="ltr">“Take me to bed,” she half whined into the kiss, poking her tongue out just far enough to curl it under Agatha’s top lip.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thought you’d never ask, sweet cheeks,” Agatha purred, pulling away only to lift Rio off the wall to tote her ass down the hallway. She was not careful in the slightest as she reached her destination and fell forward, dropping them both to the bed with her weight bearing down on Rio’s.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had a fair amount of sex in her life. In that fair amount of sex, she’d also had a fair amount of drunk sex. It was always sloppy and disjointed and usually a mess from start to finish, but something about Agatha was different.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, they were both clearly impaired, but it still felt like they were both <em>trying.</em> They were still making an actual effort to engage and not let things unfold without at least a little intention.</p><p dir="ltr">In such spirit, Rio lifted her head from the mattress with every intention of kissing Agatha again, but the other woman was too quick as she lifted herself onto first her hands and knees – hands on either side of Rio’s head and knees planted next to her Rio’s hips – and then used an impressive core strength to hold herself almost parallel to Rio as she reached for the ratty cut-up t-shirt on her frame.</p><p dir="ltr">It took a beat too long to process as Agatha pulled on it once at first and then again when Rio failed to budge. Catching the hint, Rio lifted her torso enough so Agatha could pull it off, tossing it away without a second thought. Although Rio’s body landed on the mattress again, Agatha’s hands were back on her in an instant, fingers hooking like claws beneath the band of Rio’s sports bra. Repeating the motion, she leaned up and allowed Agatha to free her chest from the confines of the day’s attire.</p><p dir="ltr">Walking into that bar, Rio’d known she looked a mess. She didn’t care; all she’d cared about was getting drunk.</p><p dir="ltr">She accomplished that, then she suddenly started to care about this woman’s eyes on her, her lips and hands and teeth and tongue all on her everywhere and anywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">She was fucking gross, to be frank, but Agatha didn’t seem to give a shit.</p><p dir="ltr">No, as she shifted around to undress herself and finally remove Rio’s basketball shorts and boyshort underwear, all Agatha seemed to give a shit about was their skin touching every single place it could be.</p><p dir="ltr">All the while, Rio just… watched her.</p><p dir="ltr">She was a little wobbly and out of focus, but she looked <em>ravenous.</em> She looked like she wanted to feast on a prize she appeared to have had her eye on for some time. It was kind of nice to be looked at like that, to see that hunger in the eyes of a woman as beautiful as Agatha was.</p><p dir="ltr">Her beauty was dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">Of that Rio was already certain.</p><p dir="ltr">Would she remember in the morning?</p><p dir="ltr">Who knew.</p><p dir="ltr">With them both stripped bare, Agatha rested on her knees at Rio’s side, her eyes flicking toward the top of the bed as she reached up to tie her hair into a loose pony, mostly to keep it out of her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“Scoot up,” came a hoarse instruction followed by a swipe of a wet tongue across dry lips.</p><p dir="ltr">A stuttered inhale caught somewhere in Rio’s throat but she gave a weak nod and listened, methodically pushing herself up to prop against the stack of pillows – who the fuck needed that many pillows? – as her deep brown eyes lifted to take in the sight of the woman before her.</p><p dir="ltr">Some part of Rio wanted to lock away the vision, the way the moonlight spilled in from the ostentatiously tall windows and cast its cool glow over Agatha’s bare body. There were the tiniest moles which dotted the pale scape of her skin, and Rio tried to pin them down one by one in her mind. The task was fruitless; she was going to be lucky to remember she was even there in the first place when she woke up in bed alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned forward, stalking her way up to Rio’s side on all fours. Her eyes were still hungry as they traced Rio’s form from the dark patch of hair between her legs up her mildly toned (but still slightly pudgy) middle to between her breasts where she visualized her attack before enacting it. Her head dipped and rough lips pressed to Rio’s sternum and kissed outward. The moment she felt them skim barely over her nipple, her back arched and a hand flew up to claw at Agatha’s ponytail, squeezing it tightly.</p><p dir="ltr">She needed more of that. Stat.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she could even consider asking, Agatha pulled the nipple between her lips, sucking hungrily in tandem with the way her tongue laved over it intentionally. It was enough stimulation to get Rio making noise in the form of weak whimpers and soft sighs, but Agatha was not quite finished with her first leg of the race.</p><p dir="ltr">A set of impossibly light fingertips traced up the inside of Rio’s thigh before sinking needily into flesh, pulling it outward as if granting herself entrance to what she wanted most. Her hand slid higher still, her palm easily fitting to Rio’s core, cupping it with applied pressure.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Ohhhhhhh</em>, Agatha,” she wailed, her hips grinding downward. The motion was too quick, too forceful in a way that almost pulled her chest from the scrutiny of Agatha’s lips. To stop that from happening, Agatha’s teeth sank down roughly into Rio’s nipple, causing her to keen helplessly into the night. “<em>Oh! </em>What the fuckkkkkk?”</p><p dir="ltr">Realizing her mistake, Agatha’s mouth was on the move, kissing her way up with heat from Rio’s neck to her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">“I haven’t even spread you open yet and I can feel you’re fucking soaking,” Agatha cooed in her ear. Rio barely started to whine in response before she felt the tip of Agatha’s tongue start at the lobe and run along the shell, causing goosebumps to flare on every inch of Rio’s skin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Horny drunk, remember?” Rio whimpered, her hips shifting again into the weight of Agatha’s palm, begging for some kind of friction.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha met it in kind, though she clearly wanted something else, too.</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">Dazed eyes flicker toward the woman beside her and met a piercing sapphire stare. Agatha didn’t say anything, but with the way she leaned in and crushed their lips together, she didn’t really need to. For as much as it said about their shared hunger in the moment, the way Agatha’s middle two fingers pressed between Rio’s lips and she began a heavy but deliberately slow wide circling said a hell of a lot more.</p><p dir="ltr">Something Rio was coming to learn very quickly was that of all things to be, Agatha Harkness was undeniably a multitasker and she liked to use it in her favor as a distraction.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like she distracted Rio with the way she pressed her tongue into her mouth so that not three seconds later, she could sink those two middle fingers right into Rio’s pulsing core.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ohhhh fuck. Fuck fuck fuck!” she cried, her body reactively clenching on Agatha’s digits as she slid them in all the way to the knuckles.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit, you’re so tight,” Agatha murmured against her jaw. She kissed it once and then twice and then pressed her lips to Rio’s ear. “You’re so fucking hot,” she growled lowly, succeeding in nearly overloading every single neuron in Rio’s brain.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha,” Rio panted, her hips working down into the feeling of Agatha’s fingers inside of her.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt so good.</p><p dir="ltr">Too good.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t want it to stop.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agathagathagatha,” she tried again, but even <em>she</em> wasn’t sure what it was she needed. More? Slower? Faster? Deeper?</p><p dir="ltr">“Keep saying my name like that,” Agatha goaded, teeth skimming down the length of Rio’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“Only… Only if you actually… <em>Fuck</em>. Start doing something in there.”</p><p dir="ltr">The softest hiss came from right below her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">“Shit.”</p><p dir="ltr">Aha! So Agatha was a little more drunk than she’d been letting on all night.</p><p dir="ltr">Once she realized her mistake, Rio realized she’d ignited a spark.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s true frenzy began.</p><p dir="ltr">Her kisses were heavy and hard on Rio’s neck as her fingers began to curl and press on Rio’s walls with each excited thrust in and out of her weeping and sopping cunt. The sounds were obscene by any measure on their own, but coupled with the sudden moans Rio could not seem to choke back?</p><p dir="ltr">It was a good thing Agatha’s next door neighbor was at least fifty yards away from her fence.</p><p dir="ltr">They’d probably have been pretty unhappy if they were any closer.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as Rio started to feel the pleasure creep in, her back arched and her hips canted downward in search of more, but when she was instead met with the cruel feeling of sudden emptiness as Agatha withdrew her fingers, her face pulled tight and her eyes flew open.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, wh– <em>Oh! FUCK!</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">It was intentional.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course it was intentional. Agatha wanted the reaction just so she could cut it off at the knees as she shoved three fingers into Rio’s cunt.</p><p dir="ltr">Those trickles of pleasure turned into a full stream just before the dam burst with a rough thrust into her core, her body tensing and then trembling as a beautiful drunk orgasm smacked right into her. Her moans were insane in volume and her fingers were so tangled in Agatha’s ponytail she would have been surprised if she wasn’t pulling the fuck out of her hair, but Agatha didn’t stop.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha kept fucking going, not giving two shits that Rio was still physically shaking from her first orgasm. Unfortunately for Rio, <em>she</em> was the little bitch in the situation, her knees closing and her hips lifting off the bed as she squirmed away.</p><p dir="ltr">Immediately, Agatha caught the hint and withdrew her hand. Still propped on her opposite elbow, she raised her fingers to her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Tracking the movement, although spent, Rio lifted her attention to Agatha who was looking her right in the eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">The very second they were locked, she pressed her fingers into her mouth, sucking every bit of Rio’s slick right off them.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck that was hot.</p><p dir="ltr">That was <em>sooooooo</em> fucking hot.</p><p dir="ltr">It was so fucking hot Rio could no longer contain herself. It felt so fucking good to be touched that way, to feel Agatha inside her as she worked her over as if it were second nature, but Rio wouldn’t be able to leave entirely satisfied until she hopefully had Agatha shouting her name she way she’d been shouting Agatha’s only moments before.</p><p dir="ltr">So quick it <em>almost</em> made her queasy, Rio swung her body to the side as a firm hand planted on Agatha’s chest and pushed, giving her no choice but to relax onto the bed. The second she hit her back, Rio’s leg swung over her body as she seated herself on Agatha’s lower stomach.</p><p dir="ltr">There, with her ponytail half fallen out and the brightest most thrilled look in her eyes as tendrils of her hair curled contrast against the white sheets, Agatha was…</p><p dir="ltr">Hot? Sexy? Drool-worthy?</p><p dir="ltr">All of the above.</p><p dir="ltr">But for the next however long, Rio wanted her to be something else.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you mine for the taking?” she questioned, raising a hand to chew on the tip of her finger innocently. She batted her eyelashes in the moonlight and tilted her head to the side as if asking the question again.</p><p dir="ltr">“You can have whatever you want.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ah, sweet, sweet victory.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it probably wasn’t as sweet as the taste of Agatha’s pussy.</p><p dir="ltr">Only one way to find out!</p><p dir="ltr">Flashing a bright and pleased grin, Rio leaned forward with both hands on Agatha’s sides respectively as she pressed their lips together in a firm kiss that was not lacking in heat nor desire. Her tongue was bold in its exploration of Agatha’s mouth, the way she wanted what she wanted and tasted all of her she could.</p><p dir="ltr">That was what it was about.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Taste.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The taste of Jameson on Agatha’s teeth. The taste of sweat on her skin as Rio licked and kissed and sucked her way down Agatha’s neck and torso. The taste of faint remnants of her day’s lotion. It was all a culmination of something Rio was suddenly fiending for, something she unquestionably could not get her fill of.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, as Rio kissed even lower and moved to settle herself between Agatha’s legs, she got to taste the one thing she wanted most.</p><p dir="ltr">Only after being a teasing little shit and running the very tip of her pinky finger from Agatha’s clenched core to the apex of her clit, of course.</p><p dir="ltr">Her head dropped and an open and deprived mouth met slick and sweat and the tiniest bit of hair. The saltiness mixed with the sweetness was heavenly on Rio’s tongue and without a second thought in her head, she began to feast.</p><p dir="ltr">Although her ministrations started slow and deliberate, she could tell by the way Agatha’s fingers came to rest on the back of her neck (with her nails bordering on the edge of biting skin) it was working. It was a build up, a series of gentle tugs to bring her closer and closer to the same beautiful precipice she’d pushed Rio over only moments before.</p><p dir="ltr">“God, you’re good at that,” Agatha sighed as her fingernails pressed and dug into Rio’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t backtalk, but she <em>did</em> unleash a gravelly moan the very second she sank her tongue into Agatha’s fluttering and destitute core. She might have been puffing her chest about fucking Rio, but it was clear she was just as damn needy, if not more.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s back arched and her hips lifted, causing Rio’s tongue to slip <em>just </em>a little further into her core. The sound it unleashed from somewhere low in Agatha’s chest in return was probably <em>the</em> hottest thing Rio was sure she’d ever heard in her life.</p><p dir="ltr">So she did it again.</p><p dir="ltr">And again until Agatha’s fingers were in her hair and gripping on for dear life.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ohhhh, <em>shit,</em> Rio!”</p><p dir="ltr">God. Damn.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha felt even <em>half </em>as set on fire as Rio did right then when Rio was moaning <em>her</em> name, it was some fucking wonder she hadn’t completely combusted. Rio felt like she’d been dunked in lava and was burning from the outside in.</p><p dir="ltr">She only got another million degrees hotter when, as she began her motions of licking from core to clit, Agatha’s hand canvassed the back of her head and shoved, forcing her down into nothing but hot and wet sex.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fucking glorious.</p><p dir="ltr">As her hips bucked upward against Rio’s face, she literally had nowhere to go and so, she did all she could do to tip Agatha right over the edge she was on.</p><p dir="ltr">With a couple carefully placed swipes with the tip of a stiff tongue, Agatha came with a vivid intensity Rio was sure she’d never seen from another woman before. Her body tensed and then released, but every muscle she had seemed to betray her as she trembled from head to toe. Her knees bowed inward and she involuntarily rolled to the side, inadvertently taking Rio with her.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t care. She was right where she wanted to be: sandwiched between the thighs of a smoking hot woman.</p><p dir="ltr">It took only another moment for Agatha to come down a little from her orgasm-induced high enough to unlock her legs to allow Rio her freedom. It came with a price, though.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come here and kiss me. Wanna know what I taste like on your lips.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkk.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Was she real? Was this attractive, voracious, insane woman <em>actually</em> real?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio did as she was told, crawling up Agatha’s body to seal their lip together in a kiss that nearly pulled Rio right back under again. She was even more convinced she could go another round when Agatha’s tongue snaked into her mouth, but when Agatha broke the kiss after another moment, Rio knew she should probably go.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fun.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was just sex.</p><p dir="ltr">Rolling off to the side, Rio landed on her back to catch her breath for only a moment. There was no question about whether or not she was still drunk (she was), but she still knew proper procedure in situations like these. Her head lulled toward Agatha and she offered a gentle grin.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m gonna head out. But… This was fun.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It was,” Agatha agreed as she reached out for a bottle of water on her night stand. “Get home safe, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">Climbing out of bed, it took little time for Rio to locate her dirty work clothes and redress herself. When she finished, she turned toward the bed to offer her farewells, but Agatha was already asleep.</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight, Agatha. Thanks for the distraction.” She breathed a soft chuckle and slowly slogged her way downstairs, realizing just how tired – and heavy – she felt by the time she got to the bottom of the stairs.</p><p dir="ltr">She <em>should</em> have called a rideshare and booked it back to her place, but…</p><p dir="ltr">In the dark of the living room, Rio’s adjusted gaze fell to the large sofa against the far wall.</p><p dir="ltr">She shouldn’t. She knew she shouldn’t. But maybe if she just laid down for a few minutes, she’d feel rejuvenated enough to find her phone and call a car…</p><p dir="ltr">So, Rio did something pretty dumb.</p><p dir="ltr">She pulled the blanket off the back of the couch, laid down, covered herself up, and then she went to sleep.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">When consciousness came for Rio the next morning, it was in the form of a strange sensation: her leg was wiggling. It wasn’t a result of her own doing, something she realized as she forced her eyes open through the hammering she suddenly felt in her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Rise and shine, you bum,” came a voice from the foot of the couch.</p><p dir="ltr">Dark eyes fell to the sight of a fully dressed Agatha, hair still damp as it fell over her knit sweater. The hand that wasn’t clamped onto Rio’s toe was extended and holding out a towel.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh fuck.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh fuck was right.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio <em>fell asleep at Agatha’s?!</em></p><p dir="ltr">She’d been drunk, sure, but she had little memory of actually being brave (read: stupid) enough to curl up on a one night stand’s couch and not get back up to head home. In fact, the last thing Rio <em>vividly</em> remembered was the taste of Agatha on her tongue and what she looked like when she came.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe staying the night, albeit on the couch, wasn’t the worst thing that could have happened. She could at least have a shot of getting Agatha’s number, now.</p><p dir="ltr">“Here. Go shower. I’m doing you a favor.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio's eyes flashed with confusion, still fighting to truly wake herself up as a lengthy yawn escaped her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you saying I stink?” she questioned, tossing the blanket back to push herself into a sitting position.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m saying I’ll probably have to Febreeze the fuck out of that couch. Between whatever you were doing before you went to the bar and our little…” Agatha paused, a sly little smirk creeping across her lips, “...romp, you’re covered in dried sweat. If you need something to wear home –”</p><p dir="ltr">“No, I’ll be okay,” Rio cut her off; she was already embarrassed enough as it was. The last thing she needed was to do the walk of shame in front of Agatha’s neighbors while wearing her clothes. “I don’t live far from – Wait a minute. Where the fuck in the city do you even live?”</p><p dir="ltr">“West end. Ten minute drive from the bar,” Agatha answered, dropping the towel onto Rio’s legs as she departed for the kitchen and the awaiting smell of coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, that meant Rio was likely only fifteen minutes from home. And it meant it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world to wear her ratty ass work clothes in a rideshare until she could get home, shower again for good measure, and change into a comfortable Sunday outfit.</p><p dir="ltr">She should probably check the app and get her ass to work, but the dull ache between her legs begged her to indulge in a day of rest; after all, she’d been going non-stop for weeks on end. Hadn’t she kind of earned it?</p><p dir="ltr">A hand landed on the plush, soft towel as her fingertips felt out every ridge and ripple of the fabric and she considered. She should just leave, she knew she should, but Agatha was at least offering her a chance to scrub off the day before instead of putting some unwitting driver through her stench for fifteen minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you sure? I can get going,” Rio asked, holding up the towel even though Agatha wasn’t looking at her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Go. Shower.”</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t authoritative, but it was firm. It was almost weird; Rio was embarrassed, but Agatha being kind of nice about her overstaying her welcome was attempting to put her at ease. It wasn’t working <em>all</em> the way, but it was kind of working.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting to her feet, Rio glanced toward the stairs as it hit her that she had no idea where the bathroom was. Also, she <em>really </em>had to pee. Drunk her apparently forgot. How the fuck that happened, she would never know.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha must have sensed the stillness because her head turned and she offered a gentle call over her shoulder as she prepared her coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">“Upstairs hallway. Second door on the left.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you.”</p><p dir="ltr">With that, Rio set off up the stairs and did as she was told. It was a quick shower, one where she did not take the time to wash her hair, but was impossibly deliberate in scrubbing every inch of her skin possible. The body wash in Agatha’s shower was vibrantly aromatic, jasmine and vanilla, and it warmed Rio from the inside out.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew it was embarrassing to not leave when you were meant to, and it was even more embarrassing to be caught in the act, but she would have been lying to say there wasn’t some tiny part of her that was a little pleased with the idea of a few extra minutes of Agatha’s time.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, that was the hope.</p><p dir="ltr">The reality?</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio returned downstairs, Agatha was… gone?</p><p dir="ltr">Everything was quiet and there was not a trace of her to be found aside from the faintest scent of her woodsy perfume that led a trail right to the front door. By the door in the entryway was a small wooden table, but it was what rested atop it that caught Rio’s attention.</p><p dir="ltr">An apple.</p><p dir="ltr">And a bottle of water.</p><p dir="ltr">On the bottle of water, there was a bright pink sticky note. The mere sight of it caused Rio’s lips to curl into a fond smile and that was before she even read what was on it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Went to the store. Get home safe. Call me sometime.</em><em><br/></em><em>555-788-9868.</em><em><br/></em><em>PS. Lock the door behind you or don’t ever come back.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Who the fuck was this woman? She was a little older, a lot hotter, and far more witty than Rio herself and yet, Rio couldn’t help but want to know more past the rumors and idle gossip. She wanted to know the truth.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to know just who Agatha Harkness was.</p><p dir="ltr">At least she had her number and a way to do just that.</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">Rio <em>meant</em> to call. She really did, but by the time she got home and shed her clothes to shower one more time and change into a set of sweats, she was fucking spent. She placed herself on the couch with every intention of watching some mindless show to distract her mind from the spliced pieces of the night before, but it took less than ten minutes until she was out cold.</p><p dir="ltr">When she woke up at 3 pm, it was to an existential sense of dread that she accomplished absolutely nothing that day. She didn’t make a dime, didn’t recoup her losses from the bar the night before, and had instead successfully slept most of the day away. She <em>could</em> have picked up a job or two around the neighborhood, but… would it really kill her to simply be still for a single day?</p><p dir="ltr">The answer ended up being no. She made herself noodles and fell back asleep shortly after, somehow managing to sleep like a rock until her alarm went off Monday morning and the hells of higher education beckoned to her.</p><p dir="ltr">By Tuesday, in her afternoon class, Rio realized something.</p><p dir="ltr">She never fucking called Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">She put her number in her phone, saved it under her full name with a purple devil emoji and then just… fucking forgot. Like an utter dumbass.</p><p dir="ltr">Careful to conceal her actions, Rio slipped her phone out of her pocket and typed a quick message, sending it with haste.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Hey.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">It was simple, but she was only half paying attention. She realized only as she set her phone down in her lap and the little response bubble appeared that she probably should have introduced herself.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Who the fuck is this?</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>How did you get this number?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s eyes flickered to the message and it took everything she had to stifle the soft snort of a laugh from leaving her. Miraculously, she drew no attention and quickly typed her reply.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Sorry. It’s Rio.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>I guess you said call instead of text, huh?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">She was <em>trying </em>to focus on class, on the lecture she was busting her ass to pay for, but the moment she remembered Agatha Harkness and all she entailed, it was suddenly all Rio could think about.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Hi Rio.</em><em><br/></em><em>I did.</em><em><br/></em><em>But now that I know who you are…</em><em><br/></em><em>I won’t have to put a hex on you.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s gaze flickered downward to read the message and a wide and thrilled smile curled her lips, untamable by any means. Even when she was being abrasive and guarded, Agatha was still kind of charming. Managing to do so over text was even more impressive.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Thank god for that.</em><em><br/></em><em>Anyway. Are you busy tomorrow?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">God. That was fucking forward, wasn’t it? Before she could consider deleting the messages, Agatha was already firing back a response.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“What time? I’ll leave the door unlocked.</em><em><br/></em><em>And be waiting.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Vidal!”</p><p dir="ltr">The professor's voice boomed throughout the lecture hall, drawing the attention of every occupant in the most embarrassing fashion.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is your lap suddenly more important than my lecture?”</p><p dir="ltr">“N-No ma’am. My apologies,” she fumbled, locking her phone and stowing it back in her pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">“I expect it from these kids, but not from you. Do better.”</p><p dir="ltr">Damn.</p><p dir="ltr">Ouch.</p><p dir="ltr">There were a few amused snickers around the hall, but Rio did her best to ignore them. It was her own fault, and nine times out of ten, she <em>did</em> do better. But each of those times before, Agatha Harkness wasn’t a factor.</p><p dir="ltr">She was a stranger, realistically, but something about her candor and the way she carried herself held a wondrous sense of allure that Rio was having a hard time getting away from. Sure, her busy schedule kept her occupied for the most part, but the moment her mind got the chance to wander, it went right back to Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">It went back to that thin sweater that did a shit job of hiding her erect nipples. It went back to her long and tangled hair and the way she so effortlessly tied it neatly atop her head. It went back to her pale but soft skin in the moonlight.</p><p dir="ltr">It went back to each and every one of those tastes Rio had logged into memory for good.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearly, there was something about it Agatha liked too, or she wouldn’t have been implying Rio could come over the next evening. Well. Rio needed it to be evening but Agatha asked her what time just before she, a grown woman past her mid thirties, got scolded by her college professor and a bunch of twenty-somethings chastised her for it.</p><p dir="ltr">How embarrassing.</p><p dir="ltr">She was attentive and intentional throughout the rest of the lecture, careful to take descriptive notes that would actually help her moving forward. Even though her focus was primarily on what she needed to be learning, there was the tiniest little fact gnawing away at the back of her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted more of Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment class was dismissed and Rio rushed out of the lecture hall, she was on her phone before she even made it outside and pulled up Agatha’s message, completely ignoring the 3 that were sent throughout the rest of her lecture (<em>Hello? What time? Rio????)</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">She could reply… Or…</p><p dir="ltr">With haste and a press of her thumb to the little phone icon, Rio brought her phone up to her ear, tucking it there securely with her shoulder as she adjusted her bag over her shoulder and began the twenty minute walk home.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, <em>now</em> I exist?” Agatha answered in a haughty tone with the brightest ring of arrogance.</p><p dir="ltr">“Listen, I was in class,” Rio responded with a soft laugh. “If you’re not too mad, what do you think about tomorrow evening? We can either meet at the bar or –”</p><p dir="ltr">“And have to listen to Kale gloat when we sit together? I’ll pass.”</p><p dir="ltr">Damn it, Agatha was actually <em>funny.</em> It wasn’t just some figment of Rio’s formerly drunken imagination.</p><p dir="ltr">“So you want me to come right over, is what I’m hearing?” she questioned, fighting the urge to add a ‘huh? Huh??’ to the end of her question. She didn’t want to be <em>too</em> annoying and have it come off as obnoxious rather than flirty.</p><p dir="ltr">“Only if you pick up a bottle of Jameson on the way.”</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck. That was an easy ask, or it wasn’t thirty-five dollars. It wasn’t like it was <em>expensive</em>, but Rio was already a little angry with herself over the money she spent at the bar the weekend before. She opened her mouth to agree, but she felt her phone vibrate against her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">“I have your number now. I sent you the money. Pick it up and be here by eight. Is that doable?” Agatha all but ordered, her tone assured and strong.</p><p dir="ltr">Who the fuck was this woman? Seriously?</p><p dir="ltr">They didn’t know each other at all and yet, it felt… right to accept the invite and promise to bring the whiskey.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sounds doable. See you tomorrow night, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“See you tomorrow night, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">And with a grin on her face, Rio walked the rest of the way home humming a stupidly jaunty tune.</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio slept that night, she dreamt of sex. It was faceless and bold, wild and tantalizing. It was everything a fantasy should be from being held down to being spanked and having her hair pulled. It was the most delicious form of release, even from within the deepest wells of slumber.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time she woke – at 2am drenched in sweat – she could have sworn by the body alone she’d been dreaming of Agatha. There was never a glimpse of a face or a profile, but dream Rio could have sworn those hands felt familiar, that tongue was smart and studied, and those teeth were just as piercing.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was a dream. Only a dream. <em>Just</em> a dream.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a dream she fingered herself to in the shower before she prepared for a long day of picking up whatever side hustle she could find that was worth the pay out. It meant being primed and ready (aka having two orgasms in the shower to the thoughts of Agatha’s hands on her and how it would soon be reality again) and trying to surge through the day with a positive attitude.</p><p dir="ltr">That was out the window when on her third job – a deep clean of a three story home main living areas – the woman (in her 80s who informed Rio her grandson helped her book the service) decided she didn’t want to pay because Rio didn’t vacuum the upstairs landing properly. After arguing with her for twenty minutes, Rio stomped out and slammed the door behind her, pissed as she climbed on her bike and rode back to her apartment.</p><p dir="ltr">It was bullshit. It was a fucking struggle to make a damn penny anymore and she was just… so fucking <em>tired.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Cruising along the side streets, Rio fished out her phone to check the day’s messages; it was a task she often pushed off while committing to the integrity of whatever work she took up that day. She could not stop the immediate and full grin that filled her face to see the bubble at the top of the screen just below the time.</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Agatha Harkness 😈</b><b><br/></b><em>6 new messages.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio was half-attentive to the road and half-attentive to her phone as she pulled up her chat with Agatha and burst into laughter.</p><p dir="ltr">The first message read:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Sure you don’t want to come over earlier?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">And then:<br/><em>“I’m not busy if you’re not busy.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">There was only a two minute break before the next message.</p><p dir="ltr">“🍑💦”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh Christ. This woman was a menace.</p><p dir="ltr">Five minutes later, a longer string of colorful characters.</p><p dir="ltr">“🍆🍑💦❓️”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was laughing so hard by the time she got through that one she almost ran into the back of a parked car. At the last minute, she swerved to the side and kept on her way, her eyes falling back to the ridiculous onslaught of sexual innuendos via emoji usage.</p><p dir="ltr">The next one was even more hilarious.</p><p dir="ltr">“👉👌💦⁉️”</p><p dir="ltr">And lastly…</p><p dir="ltr">“🌮👅🌶🍯”</p><p dir="ltr">Holy fucking shit.</p><p dir="ltr">This woman was <em>forty?</em></p><p dir="ltr">She must have had a lot of time on her hands. At least enough to scan through every available emoji to manage to be as lewd as humanly possible. It could have been deemed immature and probably would have been by someone like Jen, but Rio was thoroughly tickled as she turned into her complex and locked up her bike, suddenly anxious for eight to roll around.</p><p dir="ltr">To kill some time, she showered and lounged around while she argued with OddJobs support about the old woman from that afternoon. Per the terms of use, she was still owed at least seventy percent of the promised amount, something she was assured would be deposited to her account within three to five business days. Sure, it wasn’t like getting it any sooner was going to make a difference, but it was the <em>principle.</em></p><p dir="ltr">God. Old people fucking sucked.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, Rio knew she would be old one day but she sure hoped her main mission at that age was not to make someone else’s life hell just because the fucking vaccuum patten was wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh!</p><p dir="ltr">Shit!</p><p dir="ltr">She hadn’t texted Agatha back!</p><p dir="ltr">She brought up their chat, laughing to herself again at the ridiculous amount of emojis crammed into the last four messages.</p><p dir="ltr">Immature or not, Agatha was pretty fucking funny.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Hi! Sorry! I was working.</em><em><br/></em><em>I know it’s 7 and 8 is only an hour away…</em><em><br/></em><em>But I can head that way as soon as I get dressed?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio tossed the phone to the bed to get up and ready, but before she could take so much as a step, it sounded from its place half-buried in the comforter.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Just come naked. I’m sure no one would mind.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Ha.</p><p dir="ltr">Hahahahahaha.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Agatha, that’s a crime. I’ll see you in 25?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio grinned, wiser this time to not immediately discard her phone.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Make it 20 and I’ll make sure if you pass out this time, it’s not on the couch.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Strangers? Yes.</p><p dir="ltr">Idiots? Also yes.</p><p dir="ltr">Completely drawn to the sexual chemistry that seemed to immediately manifest between them?</p><p dir="ltr">Most definitely.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“I’ll do my best.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">With one last laugh and the bravery to toss her phone again, Rio set about pulling on a pair of cuffed joggers and a thin hoodie to do just that.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Approximately nineteen minutes later, Rio climbed the four steps of Agatha’s front porch with a brown sack-covered bottle clutched in her hand. Although the idea of dropping fifteen dollars on a rideshare to Agatha’s hadn’t been ideal, it meant she made it to the liquor store and still managed to turn up in the promised time.</p><p dir="ltr">In return, maybe Agatha would do as promised and fuck her into a coma.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, that was a mutual need but she didn’t feel so brazen as to point it out. Agatha would get hers when it felt right, of that Rio was certain.</p><p dir="ltr">With a stern and steady fist, she gave a few firm knocks to the resolute wooden door, grinning as it swung open with Agatha on full display. Her eyes were bright, her hair was down and somehow wildly tamed, and she was wearing…</p><p dir="ltr">“What the fuck are you wearing?” Rio asked through a laugh, her gaze sweeping down and back up again with a bemused smile on her face as she stepped inside.</p><p dir="ltr">“A robe. Clearly. It’s house attire. I have eight different ones.” Agatha’s voice wasn’t exactly hard, but it <em>did</em> sound like she was not going to stand for being chastised about her wardrobe while in the walls of her own home.</p><p dir="ltr">Honestly?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could respect it. She already knew what Agatha looked like when she stepped out her front door. If she chose to spend the majority of her time in comfort as opposed to favoring aesthetics while in the safety of her dwelling, who could really blame her?</p><p dir="ltr">As Agatha shut the door behind her, Rio spun on her heel and raised her arm, holding the bottle out.</p><p dir="ltr">“I made you a promise.”</p><p dir="ltr">Sharp and bright blue eyes dropped to the bottle and raised to Rio as she reached out to take it.</p><p dir="ltr">“That you did. Even though I paid for it,” she mused, stepping to the side to head for the kitchen as she removed it from its paper sack. “Even more impressive is that you made it in less than twenty minutes. Someone’s an eager beaver, hm?”</p><p dir="ltr">Although she could clearly <em>hear</em> the teasing tone Agatha was using, something about her words sparked a dull heat low in Rio’s middle. It wasn’t that she was embarrassed, but was it really that obvious just how much she wanted to fuck again?</p><p dir="ltr">That was almost more embarrassing than being called out in class by the professor.</p><p dir="ltr">“You made an offer that was difficult to refuse,” Rio voiced as she slipped off her shoes and chose to join Agatha in the kitchen. “And after last time, can you blame me?”</p><p dir="ltr">Even from behind, wrapped in her silk and navy blue robe patterned with anchors and knots, Agatha looked…</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect?</p><p dir="ltr">That was a stupid thing to call a stranger, but with her curvy figure apparent, her long and toned legs entirely visible to just below her ass – with a sliver of her black underwear and the tiniest bit of cheek showing – and her long, wild hair as it flowed effortlessly down her back, she looked divine. Delicious. An entire meal Rio wanted to gorge herself on.</p><p dir="ltr">She approached the counter, trained gaze landing on the work Agatha was making of pouring them each a glass of the newly procured whiskey.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, you remember that, do you?” came the sweetest croon of self-satisfaction. “I figured after thirty shots of bourbon, you’d have been toasted.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It was only eight, actually. And if I recall correctly, you bullied Jen into giving me water even if I don’t remember why.” There was a soft chuckle tacked onto the end as Agatha slid the glass across the countertop and right into her palm.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because,” Agatha informed, a small smirk pushing into her cheeks as she raised her glass, “you saying yes and being able to mean it actually matters. I’m not some frat boy in one of your classes. I have <em>some</em> decorum.”</p><p dir="ltr">She shifted in place ninety degrees, leaning with a hip against the edge of the counter and held the glass up.</p><p dir="ltr">“To a night you will hopefully <em>completely</em> remember.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio snorted.</p><p dir="ltr">“You say as we toast with glasses of whiskey,” she prodded even though she raised her glass anyway, echoing Agatha’s toast. “To a night I will hopefully fully remember in the morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">Clink.</p><p dir="ltr">Toss.</p><p dir="ltr">Swallow.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did it first. Rio knew she <em>should </em>have taken her shot at the same time, but she hesitated. She could say she didn’t know why, but she did.</p><p dir="ltr">She was amazed.</p><p dir="ltr">She was completely baffled by this work of a woman before her. Arguably, Rio didn’t know her, but there was a strange kinship based on physical chemistry that was beginning to flower between them. It made little sense and Rio was in no hurry to pick it apart; not when the promise of another night of skin and sweat and sex was right there, dangling in front of her face.</p><p dir="ltr">Before Agatha could recover enough to question why Rio hadn’t joined her, she choked her own shot down and reached up to swipe at a small dribble of the liquor at the corner of her mouth with a hitched thumb.</p><p dir="ltr">Then something happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Something actually insane happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha beat her to it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio felt stunned as Agatha’s thumb brushed over the corner of her mouth, retracted, and then slipped past her own lips as they wound into a smirk around it.</p><p dir="ltr">Holllllyyyyy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">That was hot.</p><p dir="ltr">A weak whimper sounded as Rio slid her glass to the side and turned her head toward Agatha, though she felt nearly out of her mind when she realized how close the other woman suddenly was.</p><p dir="ltr">She drew in a breath, almost like she <em>wanted</em> to speak, but in reality had zero clue what to say. Thankfully, she didn’t have to speak a word as Agatha’s hand found her neck and pulled her closer.</p><p dir="ltr">The kiss she landed on Rio’s lips was not timid or shy by any means and if anything, it was shouting LETS GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD! So Rio listened.</p><p dir="ltr">A hand wound around to the small of Agatha’s back and pulled her close, a sudden little blinker going off at the forefront of Rio’s mind.</p><p dir="ltr">With Agatha’s body so close, it was immediately apparent something was… different. Against the lower part of her stomach below her belly button, clear down to just above the apex of her thighs, Rio felt something <em>new.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha!” she gasped into their kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">The growled hum of question that sounded in return rang of… satisfaction?</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you strapped right now?” Rio managed just before succumbing to the taste of Agatha’s lips in a feverish kiss that communicated how suddenly and overly turned on she was.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did not break the kiss to answer; no, that would have been simple and bland. Instead she stepped into Rio, forcing her to turn so the small of her back was flat to the edge of the kitchen counter. At the same time, every bit of the bulge beneath her robe sank against cotton and skin and muscle.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, that was fucking <em>hot</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time Agatha’s tongue slipped past Rio’s lips and tangled with her own briefly, Rio melted more and more. When Agatha’s hands slipped beneath her hoodie and met warm skin, Rio was tired of being in the kitchen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Bed. Upstairs.” She managed it between heated kisses, but her final demand actually caused Agatha to pull away. “Need you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Those blue eyes were full of fire the moment Rio looked into them, snarled lips twisting into the most devious smirk. Instead of backing away and leading Rio up the stairs immediately, Agatha raised a hand and wrapped both draw strings of Rio’s hood around her fingers, giving a light tug.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, let’s go then.”</p><p dir="ltr">And like she was holding a leash and not Rio’s hoodie strings, Agatha stepped away and dragged her along.</p><p dir="ltr">Like a stupid, sex-crazed idiot, Rio padded along behind her obediently.</p><p dir="ltr">She was also checking out every bit of Agatha from behind she could see.</p><p dir="ltr">If she’d been perfect when Rio <em>didn’t </em>know her underwear were containing a decent sized strapon, she was now faultless and ethereal, nothing more than a wet dream brought to life.</p><p dir="ltr">This could have been awkward; they were both sober and honestly, knew very little about one another. Yet, with one shot of liquid courage and the silent conversations their bodies seemed to have beyond their cognition, it just felt… <em>easy.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It felt so fucking easy to let Agatha lead her up the stairs, down the hall, and right into a room Rio only half-remembered</p><p dir="ltr">It felt even easier as Agatha gave a hard yank to Rio’s strings and swung her around to the foot of the bed, a sharp but sly grin on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“Way to make a girl feel special,” Rio murmured, leaning so their lips were barely an inch apart.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, I’m just getting started,” Agatha mused in a husky whisper.</p><p dir="ltr">Their lips were back together in a flash, Agatha’s hands finding the hem of Rio’s sweatshirt while Rio’s own fingers hooked and locked into the silk of Agatha’s robe.</p><p dir="ltr">Tongues and lips and teeth lasted only a moment before Agatha separated them, a whine sounding from Rio in protest even though she realized why. A second later, Agatha lifted and pulled, removing the garment to reveal something that caused her lips find a familiar home in a smirk:</p><p dir="ltr">The hoodie was the only form of a shirt Rio was wearing. Even more, she hadn’t bothered to put on a bra given she knew where she was going and what she was doing.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tell me you went commando, too, and I’ll bend you over this bed and fuck you <em>right fucking now</em>.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Why</em>? Rio thought, <em>When showing is so much better than telling.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Both hands dropped and hooked into the cinched waist of her sweatpants, pushing them past the curve of her hips to pool at her ankles.</p><p dir="ltr">As Agatha suspected, it was all it took to have her completely naked.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s grin was thrilled, but there was a spark in her eyes that caused a shiver of anticipation to shoot up Rio’s spine.</p><p dir="ltr">Before Agatha could hastily reach for the tie around her waist, Rio’s hand shot up and grasped a thin strip of silk – one of two – and gave a pull. The half-assed bow fell apart instantly, loosening and then unraveling to allow the sides of the robe to waver slightly.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just enough that Rio could see glimpses of leather beneath soft black cotton.</p><p dir="ltr">And a bulge so decently sized it felt like someone kicked her between the legs.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit,” she breathed, finally tearing her eyes away to look back to Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">She looked positively starving, and she proved it immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">Both of her hands were moving, but only one reached for Rio’s face as their lips met in another powerful kiss. The other pulled at the neck of the robe and caused it to drop off her shoulder. With it half gone and their lips and tongues still reveling in sweet, sweet bliss, she swapped hands and let the silk drop soundlessly to the ground behind her.</p><p dir="ltr">The speed with which she broke their kiss was almost startling, but she was too quick for Rio to actually question it as she shed her panties and stood in every bit of her glory.</p><p dir="ltr">There, just inches in front of her, was the most perfect specimen of a human Rio was certain she’d ever soberly seen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Told you I’d be ready,” she stated in a proud but husky murmur.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, she wasn’t fucking lying.</p><p dir="ltr">“Now turn around.”</p><p dir="ltr">For as hot as she was, the command landed like ice in Rio’s veins. It was startling, but in a way that had her so turned on she hardly knew how to think straight.</p><p dir="ltr">The iced over feeling stalled her for a moment too long.</p><p dir="ltr">A moment where Agatha decided to simply <em>take</em> what it was she wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">Her strong and rough hands snapped to Rio’s hips turning her around with force. The moment Rio’s eyes swept to the head of the bed, she blinked and her vision changed.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Agatha placed a palm flat to her back and shoved, landing Rio face down and folded over the mattress.</p><p dir="ltr">A surprised squeal escaped, but the moment Agatha smacked her exposed ass, it very quickly seeped into a moan.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ohhhh, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“God, I like the sound of that,” came a rasped response as Agatha gave another sharp swat to the flesh of Rio’s right ass cheek.</p><p dir="ltr">Another moan left her, deeper and longer. At the very tail end of it, Agatha found a way to make it happen again:</p><p dir="ltr">She touched Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t rushed or sloppy; no, the way Agatha traced her fingers over the fault line of Rio’s slit was deliberate and intentional. It was teasing, taunting, <em>playful </em>almost<em>.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Ohhhh, godddd,” Rio whined weakly, her cheek still pressed to the mattress.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck.” It was the most aroused expletive Rio was certain she’d ever heard and it only turned her on more.</p><p dir="ltr">Some part of her was certain Agatha would cut to the chase and that she would adjust to the feeling of Agatha buried inside of her, but that wasn’t what happened.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t what happened at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio sensed movement behind her but could not understand what exactly Agatha was doing until her hands fell to the small of Rio’s back. Judging by the angle and positioning alone, she realized Agatha was on her knees.</p><p dir="ltr">She barely had time to understand what was going to happen before she felt Agatha’s tongue slip past her folds into slick desire and a throbbing core that was begging for release. The way Agatha’s mouth felt on her, it was fucking divinity in its rawest form. It was intense and wild and every laving of her tongue sent shivers throughout Rio’s entire body.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fuck. She was fucking good at that.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Beginning to feel restless, Rio shifted to prop herself on her forearms but didn’t quite get that far when she felt Agatha press down on her back at the same time her tongue slipped right into Rio’s clenching and tight core.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Ohmygod!</em> Agatha!”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could <em>feel</em> as Agatha hummed her delight into her core, though she only stopped the tongue-fucking she seemed so invested in to give one last lap from clit to entrance before climbing to her feet.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t usually do repeats,” Agatha informed her as she stepped up, running a light hand over the curve of Rio’s hip and then her ass. “But I couldn’t stop thinking about fucking you that morning as I was getting ready.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s head lifted from the mattress and turned just enough so she could catch Agatha out of the corner of her eye.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt it before she saw it. Agatha reached forward and swiped three fingers through Rio’s folds, drawing her hand back to smear Rio’s cum over the cock between her legs.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio thought she was going to fucking combust.</p><p dir="ltr">That was beyond hot. That was actually fucking insane.</p><p dir="ltr">“So then fuck me.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a smirk on her lips and a vivacious gleam in her eyes as she turned enough to catch Agatha’s gaze. For a split second, she saw it all: she saw Agatha’s hunger, her fantasies, all the things she wanted in that moment. And it set her ablaze.</p><p dir="ltr">Without another word spoken, Agatha’s hand landed in the middle of Rio’s back, shoving her forward as the other fell to guide the silicone between her folds, running through her slick as if to lube up even more. In addition, the pressure against Rio’s clit caused her to twitch involuntarily.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment Agatha was satisfied, she pressed the tip to Rio’s entrance and hesitated only briefly before slowly working her hips forward and sinking inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Ho. Ly. Mother. Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">The stretch was immediate and intense, leaving Rio gasping as she clawed at the sheets in an attempt to exert the sudden built up energy within her form. It was the most delicious kind of sting, the most beautiful ache as Agatha inched in slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to moan her name, to say she felt so fucking good, but nothing sounded other than the squeak of a moan as she attempted to work her hips back into the feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look at you,” Agatha cooed in a raspy murmur, her hands hooking over the haunches of Rio’s hips. “I know how fucking tight you were last time. Now, I can <em>see</em> it.” There was lust literally dripping off of every word Agatha spoke and it caused Rio to whimper into the mattress.</p><p dir="ltr">“You don’t want to let me go.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s pace began to pick up, as if trying to test such a theory, but it was rendering Rio speechless. She was always one for dirty talk, but the way Agatha’s hands felt on her, the way Agatha felt inside her? She was out of her damn mind if she actually thought she’d find enough rational thought to speak.</p><p dir="ltr">So she fucking <em>moaned.</em> The moment Agatha’s hips finally fell flush against her own and she simply stilled her motions, Rio let out a sound so wild and primal that she shoved her face into the mattress to try and stifle the sound.</p><p dir="ltr">“God fucking damnit, Rio,” Agatha breathed from behind her.</p><p dir="ltr">Her fingers clenched tighter, pressed firmer into the bones of Rio’s hips as she resumed her thrusting, slow at first before finding a rhythm. It was steady, but she was hitting every single spot inside Rio’s body that pushed her closer and closer to the edge of orgasm.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio finally found her voice, it was only in the form of a hoarse demand.</p><p dir="ltr">“H-Harder.”</p><p dir="ltr">No matter how raspy, Agatha heard her. She absolutely heard her.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio felt it immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was a fucking <em>force</em> as her hunger seemed to meet the demand. She was deliberate in her strokes, making Rio feel and take every inch of her in the most intoxicating way. Who needed alcohol when you had a woman that could fuck like <em>that?</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck, Rio,” Agatha groaned behind her, working with an intensity Rio hadn’t felt during sex in some fucking time. It was passionate and needy, desperate and wanting.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was eating it the fuck up.</p><p dir="ltr">And with each stroke, so was her body.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew what was coming, even before Agatha hiked a foot up on the edge of the mattress to acquire a new angle. The change in positioning allowed her in deeper, striking Rio in <em>almost </em>the right spot. With one more thrust, Rio’s eyes slammed shut and a rippling moan of insane pleasure left her lungs with force, her body tensing and trembling beneath the scrutiny of Agatha buried deep inside her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus.</p><p dir="ltr">How in the <em>fuck</em> did she feel like <em>that?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s knuckles were practically white as she clutched at the sheets below her, arms trembling from the sheer force of her grip. The euphoria was intense, so intense that as even Agatha pulled out and climbed out of her harness, Rio didn’t even give a shit about how suddenly empty she felt. After only a moment to catch her breath, she felt Agatha swat her light on the ass.</p><p dir="ltr">“Climb up,” she urged.</p><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Rio was certain she could only claw her way up and unfold in a spent heap, but after another couple of breaths, she managed to right herself and crawl properly up to the head of the bed, opting to sit against the pillows as to lay down.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t done, and now Agatha was bare.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come here,” she breathlessly voiced, her chest still heaving as she gave her lap a light pat.</p><p dir="ltr">Much to Rio’s surprise, Agatha did not argue. She did not offer some kind of sassy quip or underhanded denial. She simply obliged by climbing into Rio’s lap and draping her arms around her neck with a lax smile on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaning forward, an attentive touch skated along the inside of Agatha’s thigh and Rio pressed their lips together, clearly not finished with what they started. Sure, it felt fucking fantastic to be absolutely railed by Agatha, but there was more to it. Rio wanted to get her own out of it, too.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know I don’t have a fancy strap,” she teased, knowing full well she could have surely used Agatha’s. Her lips pulled from Agatha’s and she kissed along her jaw to her ear, brave enough to whisper a lustful request. “But I still want you to ride me.”</p><p dir="ltr">The moment it landed, Rio’s fingers slid easily through Agatha’s cum and slipped inside, a surprised moan hitting her ears instantly. She could feel as Agatha’s both spasmed and clenched around her two digits at the same time her hips began to cant and shift in need of more. One of her hands slid forward to clutch at the side of Rio’s neck as the other gripped at her shoulder, leverage as she found a steady rhythm.</p><p dir="ltr">Warm, wet lips fell to Agatha’s neck leaving hungry kisses and nips. The hand of Rio’s not occupied with the sweet gripping sex around it landed on Agatha’s hip, sweeping up her side to then palm a breast before she pinched at a nipple and gave it a pull.</p><p dir="ltr">The hand on Rio’s shoulder jumped up to grip at the hair on the back of her head, shoving it toward her chest in silent demand. Well, kind of silent. But the noises she was making were more related to the way she was taking every bit of Rio’s touch she could get by grinding down into her palm.</p><p dir="ltr">She obeyed the request and placed her mouth to Agatha’s chest, teeth skimming and nibbling as skin before pulling a pebbled nipple between them with the lightest of tugs.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hips dropped and simply began to grind into Rio’s palm as she neared her release. It was so fucking hot that Rio was nearly beside herself with how good it felt that when her tongue flicked lightly over Agatha’s nipple and she shuddered immediately in response.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could <em>feel</em> the way Agatha’s cunt clenched around her fingers as her hips bucked and dug in erratically. She could also <em>hear</em> just how good it must have felt by the way Agatha was moaning in her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">Stilling the curling of her fingers inside Agatha’s body, Rio’s face turned into that wild tangle of hair, both of them breathless and panting in the ecstasy of the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">As her limbs settled and her trembling quelled, Agatha slowly lifted herself off Rio’s hand and folded to the side, slumping against the pillows that left her half-leaning and supported by an elbow. Innocently, her head dropped to Rio’s shoulder, the breathing still shallow and rather loud in the quiet room.</p><p dir="ltr">“Where the fuck have you been the last ten years of my life?” Agatha asked with a laugh, glancing up to the woman above her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Having life crisis after life crisis in my late twenties to early thirties.”</p><p dir="ltr">They both laughed, but Rio had a little more to say.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m glad you met this me, though. No matter how much of a mess I still am.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Me too,” Agatha agreed, reaching up to run a hand through her hair. “The experience makes you a good fuck.”</p><p dir="ltr">Well… she definitely wasn’t wrong.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">While their first romp in the sheets would have left Rio completely sated, what fun was there in showing up for only one round?</p><p dir="ltr">Being tangled in Agatha, feeling her sweat-soaked skin, her hungry hands, her sharp teeth, and her absolute need was all Rio ached for. It was all she wanted and she honestly could not seem to get enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Around 1am, Rio knew she needed to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Her body was sore and feeling the weight of the night’s exertion, but she was comfortable there on her back with Agatha next to her, though they weren’t touching. They were just breathing, and feeling, and recovering, and staring at the ceiling with the most dumbstruck smiles on their faces.</p><p dir="ltr">“We gotta do this more often,” Agatha huffed quietly as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m free at night on the weekends and most of the day on Wednesdays. You have my number now, don’t be shy.” A brazen smirk pushed into her cheeks as her head turned on the pillow to behold the woman next to her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hair was a fucking mess and her cheeks were the most delightful shade of pink, but most noticeably, there was a serene smile on her lips that was clearly visible even though Rio could only see half of her face.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio considered multiple times that Agatha was hot, but right then, she looked <em>beautiful</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">The realization wasn’t a deep one, but was rather light as it hit her.</p><p dir="ltr">In reality, Rio spent years perfecting the art of not getting attached. It was something she <em>had</em> to learn throughout her life and it was still something she stood by. Yes, Agatha was a little off-kilter in a humorous way and she was strikingly gorgeous, but Rio knew better.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Rio Vidal didn’t have time for romance and that was exactly how she liked it.</p><p dir="ltr">But laying next to Agatha after hours and hours of fun and pleasure and orgasm after orgasm, she felt… a kinship?</p><p dir="ltr">They were nothing alike and yet, they fit together <em>so</em> well.</p><p dir="ltr">In a physical sense of course.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, Agatha seemed like a good friend to have around. Maybe even that was pushing it, or so Rio thought until Agatha voiced her thoughts.</p><p dir="ltr">“You have a weird schedule. I mean, I know you have class… But work on top of it? Do you never quit?” The line of questioning wasn’t harsh or even interrogative, really, but sounded like nothing more than curiosity.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio drummed her fingers on her stomach as she studied Agatha’s profile. Her lips rubbed together in contemplation and she heaved a quiet sigh.</p><p dir="ltr">“I lost my financial aid this year. Means I need to pick up fourteen thousand dollars worth of slack by the end of the year. So… Less than six months to go.” She wasn’t sure why she said it out loud; she didn’t owe this woman anything let alone an admission of crippling debt, but it seemed as though she simply couldn’t help herself.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh,” Agatha muttered, her cheek dropping to the pillow as their eyes met.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio half expected her to say something profound, maybe even soothing. The look in her eyes was distant for only a moment before she focused in again and turned down lips parted to speak.</p><p dir="ltr">“That sucks.”</p><p dir="ltr">For a second, Rio blinked at her. It wasn’t that she was offended, but she was certainly caught off guard. She wasn’t sure why, for even a moment, she considered empathy to be part of this woman’s repertoire, but she was stunned to hear her be so blunt. She was <em>so</em> stunned that the moment she regained her faculties, the only thing she could do was <em>laugh.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah. Yeah, it does, actually,” Rio agreed through her laughter as a hand landed lightly in the middle of her chest. Her fingertips skated up her sternum before her palm pressed to warm skin to stifle her giggles. “But I’m not dropping out. I’m too proud of it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hm,” Agatha snorted quietly, her eyes flickered with the faintest light. “That’s hot.”</p><p dir="ltr">Again, giggles spilled from Rio’s lips as she rolled her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Makes you wanna fuck me again, doesn’t it?” she purred. She scrunched her nose and for some stupid fucking reason like a teenage child, she stuck her tongue out.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was <em>not</em> going to let that slide.</p><p dir="ltr">“For like two seconds until you did <em>that,</em>” she shot.</p><p dir="ltr">“Did what?” Rio questioned innocently, batting her eyes as if she’d done nothing wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha replicated the expression, they <em>both</em> fell prey to loud but bright laughter.</p><p dir="ltr">“How old are you again? Twenty nine?” Agatha questioned as she calmed herself enough to breathe through her humor.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thirty-seven, actually.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And you’re in college?” Okay, <em>that</em> one was a little skeptical. Maybe it was more… disbelieving?</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, the whole ‘multiple crises’ thing, you know? But that’s a sob story for if we become real friends,” Rio joked, using her core strength to pull herself into a sitting position. She was about to announce her departure, but Agatha wanted to be heard first.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you want to? Become friends, I mean?” she asked. She didn’t move, still cradled in her spot on the bed. As Rio looked over her shoulder, Agatha seemed so… cool? So… relaxed? She seemed absolutely nonplussed by the suggestion, but if Rio wasn’t mistaken, she could have sworn she heard a little eagerness in her tone.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well,” Rio began, lips pursing slightly as she pulled her knees to her chest. “I like this little thing we’ve got going. And you’re a… very interesting person. So… I guess we’ll see who gets sick of who first, won’t we?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s lips twisted into a smirk as her eyes cut to Rio in her little ball looking all nonchalant at the offer.</p><p dir="ltr">“I guess we will. That’s you off then?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio nodded.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s me off, then,” she agreed as she unwound and climbed out of bed. It took her only a moment to locate her sweats and pull them on again, untucking her hair from the collar to pull it over her shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Text me somet– <em>Call</em> me sometime, I guess. God, what are you, a dinosaur?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha shifted around, propping herself up on the pillows as she reached over and pulled a pack of cigarettes from the drawer on her nightstand without ever looking away from Rio framed by the doorway. She shook one out and tucked it between her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">“You gonna call me ‘grandma’ next time you go to moan my name?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t tempt me,” Rio answered with a smirk. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight, Rio. Get home safe.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Will do.”</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio’s phone rang the next evening a little after five, she was completely soaked from head to toe as she stepped out of the shower. Hearing that stupid default ringtone she never bothered to change (because who the fuck called anymore), she nearly slipped reaching for her towel in order to scramble to her bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">She saw the devil emoji first.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">And so began some weird and twisted routine: Saturday nights, Sunday nights, Wednesday nights.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew she should have limited herself to her access to the absolute drug that was Agatha Harkness, but who could blame her? They were both hot and horny, so what did it really matter that they spent just under half a week letting out any pent up energy?</p><p dir="ltr">Wednesday night, Rio got a little bold. Only because Agatha did.</p><p dir="ltr">Under her robe that night, Rio could see the tiniest showing of the underside of her ass cheeks. Nothing between them.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was bare beneath her robe.</p><p dir="ltr">So as she poured them each a drink, Rio shuffled up behind her. In a matter of minutes and several kisses to Agatha’s neck, one knee was on the counter as Rio was on her own, lapping away at every delicious bit of Agatha she could taste.</p><p dir="ltr">That night, Rio left at 2am and thoroughly hated herself in class the next morning.</p><p dir="ltr">Saturday, Agatha didn’t even call. She sent a text at 5:54am.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“6pm. I’ll even buy us dinner.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Dinner, funny enough, was falafel and dolma. It worked and it gave them fuel to last until just before four in the morning.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunday, Rio texted first.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“I’ll be there at 5. With a pizza.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">She was true to her word, more than happy to indulge in another night of Agatha and all she could be.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio realized something that night, propped up against Agatha’s pillows as she took a single hit of Agatha’s cigarette and handed it back to her. Agatha was going on about the one time a buyer from her shop insisted one of her hexes worked because her ex boyfriend drove over a bridge and totaled his Ferrari. She included that he, unfortunately, did not drown.</p><p dir="ltr">The more Rio listened to the story and the undeniable humor in Agatha’s voice as she told it, the more it dawned on her.</p><p dir="ltr">They’d become friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Not the trauma-sharing kind of friends, but… whatever was between them felt strongly platonic.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe, at another point in her life, Rio would have hoped for romance, but sharing silly conversation and light anecdotes with Agatha just felt… healing. It wasn’t so much that Rio <em>needed</em> to be healed, but in a town far away from home with only a few friends, meeting Agatha Harkness made her just feel… <em>better</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Wednesday night, it was another patterned exposition of their hands on one another, their mouths everywhere they could reach. When Rio lifted her head from between Agatha’s legs and kissed up her body, she was wearing a smirk that radiated little more than sheer pride. With ease, she rolled to the side and landed on her back, an idle hand laying on her stomach as she stared up at the ceiling.</p><p dir="ltr">They were quiet for only a little while before Agatha’s head suddenly whipped to the side. It caused Rio to do the same, meeting her in a similarly dramatic fashion with a grin on her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">“I have an idea,” Agatha announced, her eyes sparkling with… innovation? Mischief?</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio raised an eyebrow. “What might this idea be?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You need money, right? Like… A <em>lot</em> of money?”</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Rio did not like where this was going. She didn’t want to be some charity case, some pity party that Agatha had sympathy for. She didn’t want to be anyone’s pet project, especially given the fact that they were still very new friends and Rio actually liked having her around.</p><p dir="ltr">“I mean… About twelve and a half thousand now, yeah,” she admitted, her head rolling to the pillow so her eyes could raise to the ceiling. “But I don’t want any donations. I can do it myself.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I know that,” Agatha half-clipped, but seemed to catch herself. “What I’m saying is… What if there was a way to do it a little… quicker?”</p><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Rio’s expression pinched in confusion. What the hell was Agatha talking about? What quicker way was there to make twelve thousand dollars than working her ass off in most of the spare time she had?</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay…?”</p><p dir="ltr">“What if we make porn?”</p><p dir="ltr">Immediately, Rio shot straight up, her eyes wide as her head whipped around to take in the sight of the woman next to her. She wasn’t smirking or grinning, like she’d just dropped some sort of punch line.</p><p dir="ltr">She was fucking serious.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, what the fuck?” Rio questioned, unable to hide the shock in her voice.</p><p dir="ltr">“I mean… Think about it,” Agatha said, sitting up and shifting to face Rio with her legs crossed in front of her. “We do this all the time anyway. What if… I’ve just been doing some research, pricing some things out… If we wanted to, we could totally film and post and I–”</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha… <em>What?</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha reached forward, pulling one of Rio’s hands into her own.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re in a pinch. I can help. We can get you the money to pay it all off and not have to worry about constantly picking up jobs you hate. Just… Consider it?”</p><p dir="ltr">It was strange, seeing Agatha be so… What was the word? Helpful? Gentle? Kind? Well, as kind as one could be while suggesting they create sexually explicit content to sell online.</p><p dir="ltr">“I… Agatha, if my classmates saw me–”</p><p dir="ltr">“I thought about that,” she interrupted, holding a finger up. “Masks. I found a shop where we can custom order them. And I’ll pay for everything. Could you maybe just think about it?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s eyes narrowed slightly as she regarded the woman in front of her. This was insane. Like <em>actually</em> insane. And yet… Was it really the <em>worst</em> idea in the world?</p><p dir="ltr">“If <em>you</em> don’t need the money, and can spend it on everything we’d need… Why do <em>you</em> want to do it?”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a fair question and Rio could see in Agatha’s eyes that she thought as much, too. She was quiet for a moment, her lips rubbing together as she tried to find the best way to word what she wanted to say.</p><p dir="ltr">“Haven’t you ever wanted to do something insane? Like… Base jumping? Or skydiving?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, shaking her head softly. “No, Agatha, because I do not have a death wish. But… I <em>have</em> always thought about streaking at a futbol game.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay! See! That’s… That’s what this is for me. And I’ve never, until now, been with anyone that I ever considered even asking. Because it felt stupid, you know? But you…”</p><p dir="ltr">Again, Rio’s laughter bubbled out of her as she rolled her eyes. “I think that’s meant to be flattering.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I mean, yes. But… <em>I</em> personally would pay a fair amount to watch us fuck. It’s only logical that other people would, too. After all, I have supreme tastes with no ego at all.” Her tone was arrogant and strong, and yet, Rio was eating up every word. Agatha was <em>funny</em>, but she was also smart as hell.</p><p dir="ltr">“I should go home,” Rio offered, gently withdrawing her hand from Agatha’s grasp. “Because if I stay, I might let you talk me into this before I give myself proper time to think about it.” She was smiling as she said it, and even as she climbed out of bed to put her clothes on.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’ll really think about it?” Agatha asked as Rio headed for the door.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew she should just say no and go on about her life, but something was pulling her in the other direction. It seemed like Agatha had given it a lot of thought, like it was something she was truly invested in, and it gave Rio pause.</p><p dir="ltr">If she’d learned anything about Agatha, it was that she was a little vain and confident, even if she didn’t necessarily use her body as a weapon in the public eye. She was smart, refined, utilitarian, and it was a good look for her.</p><p dir="ltr">Wanting to use her body for profit?</p><p dir="ltr">Well, it seemed to line up with who Rio knew Agatha to be, even on a surface level.</p><p dir="ltr">“I will. And I’ll call you on Saturday, if I don’t text you before then.”</p><p dir="ltr">In response, Agatha looked downright giddy.</p><p dir="ltr">“Please do. Get home safe, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Will do. Have a good night, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You too.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">By Friday afternoon, as Rio sat in class tapping the end of her pen against her textbook, she’d made a decision.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t want to work the next day.</p><p dir="ltr">That would only be feasible if she agreed to Agatha’s offer. Admittedly, having time to do any research over the last two days was impossible, but the more she rolled it over in her head, the more it seemed… Doable?</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha was honest about her research, about the ways to circumnavigate their identities being revealed, what could the harm be? She was right; they spent most of their time between one another’s legs and soaked with sweat and cum. It was their version of a good time, a way to not consider the outside world.</p><p dir="ltr">If they were going to do it anyway, why not turn a profit?</p><p dir="ltr">It seemed risky and dangerous, but Rio would have been lying to say it wasn’t part of the draw. She lived so much of her life a stasis of providing care to others that she never truly had much time to live on her own terms, to do the things <em>she</em> wanted to do. Maybe she never <em>wanted</em> to do porn, but knowing she could if she so chose?</p><p dir="ltr">In her own reflections, she knew it wouldn’t be easy. They would have to start from the ground up and realistically, Rio wasn’t sure just what kind of numbers Agatha was thinking they might pull. Was it possible for them to make enough money with an even split that Rio would still end up with twelve grand?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha seemed to think so.</p><p dir="ltr">So, stupidly, Rio wanted to believe her.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment class dismissed, Rio packed her bag and slung it over her shoulder, pulling her phone out of her pocket at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“What are the chances you’d be tickled pink if I asked to come over tomorrow afternoon instead of tomorrow night?”</em></p><p dir="ltr">She could have just called Agatha, but the trip home was sure to be plagued with noise and it felt unnecessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Halfway there, her phone buzzed.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“Color me bubblegum. Does that mean you’re in? </em>😏😈⁉️<em>”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled softly, shaking her head at her own prior logic.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearly, the little purple devil next to Agatha’s name in her contacts was not entirely unwarranted.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“I’m in. See you around 2?”</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>“I’ll be waiting.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio shoved her phone into her pocket as she breathed another soft laugh and made the rest of the trek home. By the time she stripped down and climbed into the shower, she realized something.</p><p dir="ltr">She hadn’t stopped thinking about Agatha the entire time.</p><p dir="ltr">What a fucking mystery that woman was.</p><p dir="ltr">She was clearly wealthy with her big house, her pricey wardrobe (including her variety of well-crafted silk robes), her Etsy shop for pittances, her sex toy collection, and her ability to apparently finance porn production. But… Even with all that money, she was still alone.</p><p dir="ltr">She hadn’t given up much to that point, but Rio could sometimes see a look in her eyes in the quieter moments, even if she was staring at the ceiling. It was a look that said while nothing was wrong, not everything was right, either.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, Rio understood there was a line, as it was one she had for herself. They were getting closer, sure, but there were just some things people didn’t talk about. Rio knew that much first hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t need to hear her lament over the years lost to duty of care. She didn’t need to be told about the decade of Rio’s life that was little more than ailments and funerals. What they were doing was fun, a good time, and the very last thing she thought she should do was rain on their parade.</p><p dir="ltr">Because if she started raining, she wasn’t sure if she could find a stopping point.</p><p dir="ltr">For the most part, Rio spent her life coping by not coping. She ignored, deflected, and focused her energy on various things like school and sex simply to get by. They were projects that required her attention, things she needed to be present for, and it kept her from slipping too far into the past.</p><p dir="ltr">More than <em>needing</em> to be present when it came to sex with Agatha, Rio <em>wanted </em>to be present. As it so seemed, she was going to have to start doing it just a little more.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time she was finished with her shower and stepped out to dry off, Rio came to the realization that her body was still stuck on the last full thought that passed through her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Sex with Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Pacing into the bedroom naked, Rio glanced at her dresser and gave a soft sigh of surrender, opening it to grab one of her vibrators instead of a pair of panties and a tank top. It was stupid; she literally <em>just</em><b><em> </em></b>showered and should just try to sleep, but the dull throb between her legs begged to argue.</p><p dir="ltr">She fell asleep after her third orgasm, brought on by thoughts of Agatha pounding into her, thoughts of the taste of Agatha’s desire, thoughts of her fingers so deep inside Agatha’s body that it made her eyes roll back each time they curled. It was a porno in its own right, truth be told.</p><p dir="ltr">When she woke up Saturday morning, it was to realize Agatha was right.</p><p dir="ltr">About everything.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, at least about the porn.</p><p dir="ltr">Those memories Rio kept, the ones that brought her wave after wave of please when Agatha could not be around to do so, they were fucking <em>hot</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">And if she thought they were hot, so would a bunch of lonely and horny prospective buyers.</p><p dir="ltr">She laid in bed for a short while, flat on her back, and let herself truly consider everything Agatha told her Wednesday night.</p><p dir="ltr">She said she’d done research. Not unbelievable, as Agatha had previously explained why she owned each toy she did based on things she learned both beforehand and in practice. She said she could bankroll it; again, not entirely far-fetched. Clearly she had the money and this idea she’d gotten in her head seemed to be a worthy cause to spend it on. She promised anonymity, though Rio did mildly dislike the idea of not being able to kiss her if they were going to be wearing masks.</p><p dir="ltr">As it seemed, there were both pros and cons to agreeing and yet, after an hour in bed post-waking up, Rio realized there were more pros than cons.</p><p dir="ltr">She could earn money (though it remained to be seen how much or how quickly) by doing something she already liked doing. She could spend more time with a friend, someone she was growing fond of. She could have a good time. She could do something in her life for <em>her</em> beyond just her education. She was getting older and honestly, Rio could admit her life hadn’t been very exciting to that point.</p><p dir="ltr">So what could it hurt?</p><p dir="ltr">After another quick shower to wash off the lust from the night before, Rio took to tending to household chores like dishes and laundry, sure to check the time every so often.</p><p dir="ltr">Or, rather, every ten minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">That pissed her off.</p><p dir="ltr">Why did time seem to move slower when you had something to look forward to?</p><p dir="ltr">By the time she’d all but done a full-apartment clean, Rio looked up and grinned at the time on the microwave.</p><p dir="ltr">1:17</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck. Yes.</p><p dir="ltr">With one last additional shower to scrub off the sheen of sweat from her morning of self-care, Rio dressed herself in a typical pair of joggers and a collared sweatshirt with her school logo emblazoned on the front. Her hair fell in easy waves over her shoulders and although she knew she would probably end up sweating it off with an entire day ahead of them, she took only a couple of minutes to throw on a light layer of foundation and a quick swipe of eyeliner. She smirked at herself in the mirror and set off, quickly finding her way to Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">At 1:58, Rio was on her doorstep and raising a hand to knock gently at the door.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s unlocked!” came a call from inside.</p><p dir="ltr">With a light shake of her head, Rio let herself in and shut the door behind her, sure to kick off her shoes before climbing onto Agatha’s big fancy couch to rest beside her. She was on her laptop, eyes barely leaving the screen to glance up at her new arrival. Her brows were pinched slightly and she looked focused.</p><p dir="ltr">She looked like she needed a break.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was more than happy to offer one.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t even look toward whatever Agatha was focused on as she slid up next to her, reaching to shut the screen as she leaned in to place a kiss on Agatha’s neck. Before she could even get it half-way closed, Agatha’s hand shot up and stopped her at the same time she squirmed away just enough that Rio’s couldn’t reach her skin.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, no,” Agatha advised, settling back into her spot. “You’ll get what you want. But first…” she flicked her fingers outward to draw Rio’s attention to the computer. “We need to do some shopping.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio <em>knew</em> she should have expected something outrageous, but when she glanced over to see two windows side by side and both with insertable strap-on dildoes, as if Agatha were fucking <em>comparing</em> them, her jaw dropped and her eyes went wide.</p><p dir="ltr">Holyyy shittt.</p><p dir="ltr">She was not fucking messing around. She got the green light via a text message and Agatha stomped on the gas.</p><p dir="ltr">Something new Rio was learning about Agatha: when she wanted something, she fucking went after it, no holds barred.</p><p dir="ltr">“One ‘I guess I’ll film porn’ text message and you’re immediately shopping for dildoes. Why am I only mildly surprised?” Rio said as she looked from the screen back to Agatha, who was grinning like a Cheshire cat.</p><p dir="ltr">“You just don’t know me well enough, yet. Also, it’s cute you think I’ve only been looking at dildoes since last night.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Damn. That somehow made Rio even hornier than she was when she showed up at Agatha’s front door.</p><p dir="ltr">And Agatha was in one of her robes, though the little legs of a pair of boxers were barely visible beyond the hem. Fuck. It wasn’t going to be as easy this time to get her going. That was unfortunate.</p><p dir="ltr">“So I suppose you might want to show me your shopping cart?”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>That</em> was the invitation Agatha was waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’d love to.” Her hand dropped to the touch pad and moved the mouse across the screen, bringing up her cart with ease. The first item that appeared on the screen almost made Rio choke on her own spit.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that a harness for <em>two</em> straps? Are you kidding me?” She wasn’t sure if she was more astounded or turned on at the idea of Agatha wanted to fuck her twice over at one time, but regardless of which it was, she still squirmed slightly in the seat next to her, realizing her underwear were going to be wrecked in a matter of fucking minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">“It was just an idea! We haven’t had the anal talk yet, so I thought I’d put it on the table.” The way Agatha was holding conversation, it was as if it were simply another day at the office for her. It was like this was something she’d done a million times before, even though she already admitted it was a first time thing for her.</p><p dir="ltr">For Rio, she was suddenly fantasizing about the idea of Agatha stuffing her twice at once and other people getting off to that.</p><p dir="ltr">She was a bit dazed in her fantasies before a hand whipped in front of her face and snapping fingers drew her back into reality.</p><p dir="ltr">“Earth to Space Cadet Rio,” she chimed with a hint of sarcasm. “Need you with me, captain. These are joint decisions.”</p><p dir="ltr">Yes. Yes they absolutely were. But how the fuck was Rio supposed to focus long enough to make informed decisions when all she could do was think about how it would feel to put all these things to use.</p><p dir="ltr">“Right. Sorry. You just caught me off guard.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So we’ll put that on the no list,” Agatha deduced, sliding the mouse down to remove it from the cart. Before she could solidify the choice with a click, Rio grabbed her wrist.</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t say that,” she pointed out, their eyes meeting as hers sparkled with intrigue and mischief. “Keep it. Show me what else.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha smirked slightly and scrolled instead of clicked, revealing two more selections. One was a panty-harness that led down to both thighs and the other, just below it, was a swirled purple and white dildo. When Rio’s eyes flickered to the description, a soft chuckle left her.</p><p dir="ltr">“You want to put eight inches in me, huh?” she teased. “Or is that for me to use on you?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s seven point eight nine insertable. Maybe if you’re lucky, we can eventually take turns.” Agatha was still smirking (something she couldn’t seem to shake) as she scrolled lower. In doing so, she revealed a full body harness of leather straps cut perfectly to mold to the body it was placed on. “How do you feel about this? I put it in of the mind I’d love to fuck you in it, but if you hate it, I can get rid of it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Once again, Rio’s mind was throttled into sexual delusion as she pictured herself wrapped in leather with Agatha’s hands on her. Unwittingly, the softest whimper escaped and she snapped back to the moment, her eyes falling to the woman next to her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha looked like she was winning the lottery over and over with each item they passed over.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s not a no, is it?” she questioned, raising a brow.</p><p dir="ltr">“Keep it,” Rio voiced strongly. A smirk found her, too, and they turned back to the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">For about twenty minutes, they went through Agatha’s cart nixing things that didn’t feel right and adding ones that did. There were hemp ropes, handcuffs, harnesses and dildoes galore and with a smug click of a button, Agatha dropped an <em>assload</em> of money on making their sex life both visible and more exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio began to ask what was next, Agatha answered her first.</p><p dir="ltr">“All of the camera, sound, and lighting equipment was bought yesterday and should be here by the end of this upcoming week. I’ve been reading up on a lot of different sites to figure out standards of quality and the technicalities. I need to learn a little more, but it’s no big deal.” She paused for a moment and turned to the laptop, moving the mouse up to another tab.</p><p dir="ltr">“But… This is the important part. And yes, I will have to measure your head before you even ask.”</p><p dir="ltr">When she opened it and revealed what it was she’d been looking at, Rio’s jaw dropped for the second time.</p><p dir="ltr">There on the page were photos of the most beautifully crafted geometric animal masks. There were birds, wolves and rabbits. They were all carefully tailored and made for show, but even Rio was surprised by how… elegant they seemed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, what the fuck? These are gorgeous?” she gushed, leaning a little closer to get a better look. “Have you… Have you picked any out for us yet?” Her head turned in time to catch the shake of Agatha’s head as she considered her words for a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">“I want you to remember that this is a team effort. So… I wanted to leave that decision up to you. Because yeah, agreeing on sex toys is one thing, but this feels…” She waved a hand flippantly as she said her next words, trying to downplay the weight of them. “More intimate, I guess.”</p><p dir="ltr">She was right.</p><p dir="ltr">These were the faces they would be presenting to an audience who could never know who they were. It was a shared secret between them, something they <em>chose</em> to show the world while exposing the most vulnerable parts of themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, thank you for that. Very considerate.”</p><p dir="ltr">For a split second, Rio <em>almost</em> kissed Agatha on the cheek. She moved barely a hair and caught herself.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Nooooooooooooooooo.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>What a terrible instinct to have.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Sure, it was just a gesture of appreciation, but it was also too… Soft. Too mushy. Too personal for their friendship.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Rio reached down and scrolled through the page, slowly so she could take the time to gauge how she felt about each piece. When she got about halfway down, something caught her eye.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a beautifully designed deer mask, with its pointed but curved ears and its gentle snout and its tamed and gentle rack of antlers. It was a gorgeous piece and one that drew Rio’s attention immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">“I like that one,” she stated aloud, clicking on the thumbnail to bring up the page for it. “I mean, I know antlers are for stags, but… It’s gorgeous. But… What is it you’re wanting?” Yes, it was an amazing piece, but if it clashed with Agatha’s vision of how this was all going to look, she was willing to find something else.</p><p dir="ltr">“I am <em>so</em> glad you asked!” Agatha chirped, resuming control of the mouse. She went back a page and scrolled down further, almost to the bottom of the page. Rio hadn’t even had a chance to look at the thumbnail before she brought it up.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s selection, ironically, was a chiseled and sculpted mask of a fox.</p><p dir="ltr">It, too, was stunning in its presentation and Rio was truly gobsmacked at just how intricate both masks actually were. It was clear that this wasn’t just a way to make money for the artist, it was something they were <em>passionate</em> about, something they truly poured their heart into.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, if it was passion they were looking for, such finer details would certainly help.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fox and doe, huh?” Rio hummed, leaning into Agatha playfully.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh!” Agatha exclaimed. Rio could hear the thrill in her voice before she even lifted her eyes to the bright grin Agatha was wearing.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes?” Rio questioned dubiously.</p><p dir="ltr">“I think you just named our channel.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">“Now, onto the next order of business!”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio groaned.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha wasn’t done shopping. That was incredibly unfortunate given the fact that Rio’s cunt was practically throbbing between her legs, almost painful in its demand. Who could blame her? They’d literally just spent an hour going over the perks to different sex toys and how they would both feel and look good.</p><p dir="ltr">And half the time, all Rio could do was think about using them.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t the <em>only</em> thing she could do, but pretty damn close. She would claim she wasn’t to blame; it wasn’t her fault she’d never done anything quite like letting her fuck buddy drop over a grand on sex toys and even more on the equipment needed to film it before. Then again, it wasn’t something Agatha had done before, either.</p><p dir="ltr">But Agatha was calm, collected, and professional. She barely had any trace of pink to her cheeks while Rio felt her own had been burning since she sat down on Agatha’s couch. She was treating this like business, which it kind of was, but Rio just <em>knew</em> her little sheer boxers had to be absolutely soaked.</p><p dir="ltr">She was just better at being a hold-out than Rio was.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck, if given the chance, Rio would have launched the laptop from her lap like it was a damn frisbee and replaced it with her head between Agatha’s legs.</p><p dir="ltr">But nooooo, there was a whole fucking ‘next order of business’ to worry about.</p><p dir="ltr">“And what might that be?” Rio asked her eyes fixed on Agatha’s profile, her tongue keeping out from between her lips to show her focus.</p><p dir="ltr">After another couple of clicks, Agatha raised a hand and flourished it toward the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">“This, actually.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s attention swept to the computer, an immediate smirk on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“Lingerie?” she questioned, clearly intrigued.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t sure why, but she hadn’t actually given much thought to anything outside of being bare ass naked (and maybe in a full-bodied leather harness) while being fucked for anyone to see. It never really crossed her mind that there could be appeal in sensuality and allure, or that there was more to the whole business plan than just filming while fucking raw and throwing it online.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, so…” Agatha paused and pressed her lips together as she scrolled slowly and parsed out the right way to explain a little further. “From my research, I found that we might find the biggest pull, cash wise, from OnlyFans.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed. It wasn’t a casual ‘ha-ha that’s a funny joke’ kind of laugh, but rather the kind where she was completely caught off guard by the idea that at the ripe age of thirty-seven, she was going to have a fucking OnlyFans account.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sorry,” she attempted to dismiss, but when she looked over to Agatha, Agatha was looking right back and she was… just<em> grinning</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s okay. Two weeks ago, I barely knew what it was. Now I’m halfway to having the terms and conditions memorized.”</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe Rio was still getting to know her, but that actually seemed rather believable for Agatha based on what she already knew.</p><p dir="ltr">“But!” she segued, looking down at the screen again. “It’s… intricate. There are… tiers, sort of, where we decide what to charge, what to share, and price out individual pay-to-see items on our own. So yes, definitely the cash grabber, but… If you’re alright with it, we can also post to PornHub and link directly to the page in the video. They’re a little different in that to make money from ad subsidiaries, the videos have to be at least seven minutes. Which, again, won’t pull <em>as</em> much, but every penny counts, right?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was in awe.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was being informative and succinct, but it was also impressive to know she’d spent a good chunk of her time actually invested into getting things right.</p><p dir="ltr">If Rio was learning anything at all outside of the inner-workings of homemade porn, it was that Agatha Harkness was <em>never</em> to be underestimated.</p><p dir="ltr">Nevertheless, Rio still had questions.</p><p dir="ltr">“And lingerie ties into this how?” It wasn’t skeptical, but instead rang out quite curious.</p><p dir="ltr">“If I’ve forecasted this correctly, we start with a no charge base subscription.” Agatha whisked the mouse up the screen and clicked on a different tab that was untouched to that point.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the OnlyFans website, and it was also their road map for the next however long they were committed to producing content.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, the words ‘no charge’ flagged immediately in Rio’s mind.</p><p dir="ltr">“How are we supposed to make any money if we don’t charge anything?” she questioned as her brow furrowed in misunderstanding.</p><p dir="ltr">“Have some patience, would you?”</p><p dir="ltr">Patience?</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck yeah, Rio had patience, or they would have been fucking twenty minutes ago.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m waiting.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So it’s basically a buffer to figure out where to go up to from there. Being able to offer luke-warm content, like <em>photoshoots in lingerie</em>,” she attempted to explain, but Rio’s mind was off to the races again.</p><p dir="ltr">Photoshoots.</p><p dir="ltr">In lingerie.</p><p dir="ltr">With Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">God, that was a whole new turn on Rio wasn’t ready for.</p><p dir="ltr">“...then we can also post the more… unholy side of said photoshoots for an additional charge. The videos themselves will almost always be pay-to-view, mostly due to duration, but once we gauge interaction the first week or two, we can bump the subscription to a paid one. They start at $9.99 a month and can go up to $49.99 a month. And that’s just the basic subscription.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was scrolling through the page as she spoke, using the mouse to indicate sections that supported her explanation.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was following along, at least to a degree.</p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Free to start</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Charge for the slightly more inappropriate content</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Charge more for the <em>really</em> inappropriate content</p></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Build up from there</p></li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">Maybe business economics were not Rio’s forte, but they sure seemed to be Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">She <em>did</em> run a shop built on the back of fabled magic and animosity, didn’t she?</p><p dir="ltr">It appeared that for the tenth time in the duration of their friendship, Agatha had blown Rio away.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t just the money or the toys or filming equipment or the lingerie. It was more than that. It was Agatha’s unyielding determination to do something right or not at all that truly left Rio stricken with admiration.</p><p dir="ltr">But there was something about it she found herself needing to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha?”</p><p dir="ltr">Bright blue eyes lifted and turned, falling right into Rio’s dark amber ones.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio shouldn’t ask. She knew she shouldn’t ask.</p><p dir="ltr">But she did anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why are you doing this?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s gaze flickered against her will, but Rio didn’t miss it. Not a chance. She also did not miss the way Agatha’s lips twitched down then up, pulling apart in a gentle smile.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because I want to, selfishly,” she admitted, but that little flicker returned just before she continued. “And because… While we aren’t ‘toh-tal besties!’” she teased in a valley girl voice, “I think I can consider you a friend. And I don’t like watching friends struggle. Anyone else? Struggle away! But you…”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha released a quiet sigh and glanced at the screen for just a second before she looked to Rio again.</p><p dir="ltr">“You need the help. But you won’t take it without feeling like you’ve earned it. So you can earn it by letting me blow your back out.” Okay, so that last little bit lost its generosity and was filled with smugness, instead, but Rio couldn’t blame her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had a point.</p><p dir="ltr">They were going to fuck, regardless, so if they could add a little more flair, record it, and get paid, why the hell not?</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to say ‘thank you’ because it’s a little atypical to thank someone for fucking you, but… I appreciate the friendship. And I appreciate the help.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was way too tender for their given setting, but Rio meant it. She might not have been ready to spill her life story, but it felt nice to be called a friend and to consider Agatha one in return.</p><p dir="ltr">They were friends. Friends that were about to broadcast their sex life to the world, but friends all the same.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, it’s nice to feel appreciated,” Agatha returned slyly.</p><p dir="ltr">If Rio hadn’t known any better, she would have said Agatha used it in place of a ‘you’re welcome.’ It was only slightly surprising because she chose to pass up an opportunity to give her hell for it. One thing Rio knew after their couple of weeks of entanglements was that when she wanted to, Agatha could be a brat.</p><p dir="ltr">“So… lingerie. You’re getting stuff too?” Rio questioned, bringing the conversation around full circle.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course. You can’t be the only tease here,” Agatha quipped with a soft snort. She switched tabs again, scrolling through laperla.com with that same smug smile on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“I saw this one earlier and it caught my eye. It goes with the lace panty harness quite well, I think,” she indicated, bringing up the full page, this gorgeous brassiere on full display. It was mainly black, but with a floral ivory frastaglio along the top of the cup. It was… simple, but elegant.</p><p dir="ltr">Not like Agatha at all, but Rio knew that was the point.</p><p dir="ltr">She still couldn’t seem to stop herself from giggling anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“Something humorous you want to share?” Agatha questioned, suddenly eyeing her with pointed curiosity.</p><p dir="ltr">“For a woman that is in only a silk robe and <em>maybe</em> boxers ninety five percent of the time, it seems… Flashy? For you, I guess?”</p><p dir="ltr">Although Agatha rolled her eyes, she was grinning as she turned her focus on the laptop. “Oh, Rio. I am only who I allow people to see. Most things in life demand a different face. This is no different.”</p><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Rio just blinked at her. Agatha was paying her no mind and was clearly happy to peruse through lingerie options.</p><p dir="ltr">What Agatha was saying was obviously her truth, but it was a thought that never really crossed Rio’s mind. It wasn’t just applicable to Agatha herself, but also applied across a large spectrum. It was something Rio, herself, was guilty of.</p><p dir="ltr">Though, maybe ‘guilty’ wasn’t the right word.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a defense mechanism to put on different masks to appease local company. It was a reaction to wanting approval, or sometimes needing it.</p><p dir="ltr">So it left Rio to wonder…</p><p dir="ltr">What mask was Agatha wearing when it was just the two of them?</p><p dir="ltr">Was it the same one Rio chose to wear? The one where she hid her loneliness and desperation to have any kind of connection (platonic or otherwise) with another person?</p><p dir="ltr">Or was it just a mask that kept her safe?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was completely of the understanding she might never know.</p><p dir="ltr">The only masks of any importance now were the ones they would be donning throughout their new endeavor.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally tuning back in, Rio lifted a hand to point at the screen. “What about that? For me I mean.”</p><p dir="ltr">Right in front of her fingertip was a lace bodysuit, underwired and filled with depictions of small roses. The crotch had snaps and the way it was cut, it looked like the straps could be removed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh-ho, this one?” Agatha clicked on it, bringing up the full image.</p><p dir="ltr">With immaculate timing, Rio glanced up to gauge her expression only to find her licking her lips in a quick swipe.</p><p dir="ltr">“In the cart it goes!”</p><p dir="ltr">Their soft laughter meshed together, offering Rio a bit of a reprieve. In all honesty, she was still thinking about Agatha and her many masks and it was good to have something else to focus on.</p><p dir="ltr">After another thirty minutes or so, Agatha’s cart was filled with hundreds of dollars worth of lace and silk and while Rio would have normally been uncomfortable with someone spending so goddamn much money on things for her, she knew they were not gifts.</p><p dir="ltr">They were investments.</p><p dir="ltr">Every single dollar Agatha was dropping into their little project was spent toward a dollar inevitably earned, and Rio could respect it.</p><p dir="ltr">While she was still a little uncertain about what might actually happen once they got up and running, there was something about the confidence in Agatha that gave Rio faith. Whatever happened, it was at no cost to Rio and at least financially, she would be no worse off than she currently was.</p><p dir="ltr">It seemed that was exactly how Agatha wanted it.</p><p dir="ltr">As she clicked one last time and submitted the order, Rio did not give her even a second to declare they had something else to do. A hand snapped out and latched to the top of the laptop screen and carefully closed it before relocating it to the coffee table.</p><p dir="ltr">With it gone, Agatha’s lap was finally free.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio placed herself in it instead.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’ve been waiting all afternoon to do that, haven’t you?” Agatha purred, tilting her head enough to make eye contact.</p><p dir="ltr">“I honestly haven’t stopped thinking about that double strap harness along with literally everything else we’ve been looking at. So, yeah. Pretty much all afternoon.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s head dropped and their lips met in a mild kiss that grew in heat within seconds. Before she could lose herself in all that was Agatha Harkness, she had a question.</p><p dir="ltr">She broke their kiss, but only to place a few along Agatha’s jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why a fox?” she breathed against Agatha’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha released a huff of a chuckle and reached up, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair to pull her back so they were eye to eye.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because,” she began, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she continued, “while humans have a vocal range of three and a half octaves, foxes have five. Was thinking maybe you might help me get there.”</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio laughed softly against Agatha’s lips, only one thought ran through her mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>I am so fucking lucky to know this woman.</em></p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">It took thirteen days for every last purchase to arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio only knew because her phone had 12 unread text messages by the time she got out of class and before she could read a single one of them, her phone rang in her hand.</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Agatha Harkness </b>😈<br/>Incoming call</p><p dir="ltr">Of course. Of course she would call literally less than a minute after Rio finished with class.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you have someone following me?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, hello to you too.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed softly into the phone. “Good afternoon, Agatha. How did you know that I literally <em>just</em> got out of class if I do not have a tail?” It was a fair enough question, but she could almost hear Agatha roll her eyes on the other end of the line.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Because,</em>” she returned dramatically, “You told me Fridays are 3 pm days. It is three-oh-two. So… Seemed fair.”</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, like right then, it truly hit Rio just how fucking observant Agatha actually was. She remembered that conversation, one where she mentioned it in passing in a way to allude to her busy schedule, but there was apparently something about it that stuck with Agatha enough to remember.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, you got me before I could read your messages. Is everything okay?” She adjusted the bag over her shoulder but kept walking toward the bike rack, thankful for the mild autumn afternoon ride ahead of her.</p><p dir="ltr">“If it wasn’t, you really shot it all in the face by assuming I was having you watched, didn’t you?” Ooh, someone was feeling feisty that day, wasn’t she?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t sound on-edge, exactly, but there was an undeniable buzz to her voice, a coating over her tone that tried to dampen whatever it was she felt right then. It didn’t take Rio too much longer to understand why.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know this is normally you’re… ‘decompression time' or whatever… But do you think you might want to come over tonight?”</p><p dir="ltr">Yes.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t even have to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio always wanted to come over.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she could say so, Agatha continued.</p><p dir="ltr">“Everything’s finally here.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh <em>fuuuuuuuuuck.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio wasn’t entirely sure what that meant for the night ahead of them in terms of being physical, but she was certainly of the mind that they were going to spend the night opening boxes and washing toys and trying on lingerie and –</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio?”</p><p dir="ltr">With a soft and sputtered cough, Rio reigned herself back in from the wandering her mind often did when it came to Agatha and the time they spent together. And now, the time they <em>would</em> be spending together and what that all meant.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t paying attention.” As she reached the bike rack and popped the lock, she lifted the phone from the shoulder and aimlessly glanced down the street, trying to keep her mind on the conversation at hand. “But yes, Agatha. I will come over tonight. Let me run home, shower, and eat and I’ll –”</p><p dir="ltr">“No need. I’m making dinner. To, y’know, celebrate or whatever.” Her tone was so cool, so even, but Rio didn’t buy it. She was being kind, <em>too</em> kind, even for the friends they’d become over the months.</p><p dir="ltr">“Or whatever?” Rio parroted back, clearly suspicious. She climbed onto the bike and set off, suddenly in a hurry to make it home and clean up for a night spent with Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">On the other end of the line, there was a soft sigh before Agatha cleared her throat. In Rio’s mind, she could almost picture the series of expressions crossing over Agatha’s face without her having to say a single word.</p><p dir="ltr">For about a month, at that point, they’d been spending three nights a week together. Sure, most of the time they were stripped naked and clawing at one another like wild animals, but there were gentler moments, too, more platonic ones. There were moments where they shared take out or a drink and watched some Scandinavian murder mystery where Agatha already knew who the killer was and was simply waiting for the show to catch up and confirm her suspicions. There were moments when they drank coffee at 3 am on a Saturday morning so Rio could get home safe and return that night.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Rio never stayed.</p><p dir="ltr">Not once.</p><p dir="ltr">Ever.</p><p dir="ltr">It was what was best, she told herself. It was the best way to handle their friendship and keep both of them from crossing any lines that needn’t be crossed.</p><p dir="ltr">Did Agatha making dinner sort of feel like she was crossing that line?</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe a little.</p><p dir="ltr">And then she opened her mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look, I figure if I make you chicken piccata and feed you some white wine, you’ll be a little more… relaxed.” There was the tiniest bit of tension in her tone as she said it, something that set Rio’s teeth on edge.</p><p dir="ltr">“Relaxed for what?” she asked hesitantly. For some strange reason, she couldn’t shake the thought that she might not be ready for whatever answer Agatha was going to give.</p><p dir="ltr">“With everything in, I thought we might… Maybe do a photoshoot tonight. And, if you drink too much, you can sleep on the couch again. Or maybe in my bed.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Right.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio <em>did</em> say the night. When she was drunk. So at least if she got too nervous, got it over with, and pounded down a bottle of wine, she had a couch to pass out on. While the bed was likely more comfortable than the couch, Rio had a good feeling she’d find little sleep on a mattress next to Agatha no matter how intoxicated she was.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, hopefully I won’t be getting so drunk I can’t make it home, but… Best to get the ball rolling, right?” she huffed as she turned a corner, a little closer to home.</p><p dir="ltr">“What better time than now, right?”</p><p dir="ltr">Unable to contain her laughter, Rio used one hand as she made another turn down an alley while the other held the phone to her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright. Enough colloquialism speak. I’m almost home. I’ll shower and get a car over. Unless you have some secretly hot muscle car and want to come pick me up.” She was perhaps baiting Agatha a little, but when she felt her phone vibrate in her hand, she knew better.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, but there’s the money for a rideshare. See you ASAP! Bye!”</p><p dir="ltr">Before Rio could even attempt to get a word in edgewise, Agatha fucking hung up on her.</p><p dir="ltr">As annoying and slightly angering as it was, it was also kind of hot.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha just did whatever the fuck she wanted. She didn’t ask for permission, she didn’t wait for approval. She made her moves with her chin high and not a lick of regret to be found. What she did, she did with intent. Where she went, she went with purpose. Agatha might have still been so much of a mystery to Rio, but Rio felt like she was <em>very slowly</em> beginning to figure Agatha out.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted people to leave her alone. Most people. She wanted <em>most people</em> to leave her alone.</p><p dir="ltr">But not Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of wanting Rio to leave her alone, she’d made an offer that was hard to refuse, but one that ensured they were entangled for a foreseeable future. Rio knew she could walk away at any time, that she could tell Agatha she was uncomfortable or nervous and it would be accommodated at the drop of a hat, but she didn’t <em>want</em> to.</p><p dir="ltr">Because honestly?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wouldn’t have ever dared dream of doing what they were doing with anyone else.</p><p dir="ltr">She was a private person, kept to herself and kept her head down. She wanted her degree and the hope for a better future and she was bound and determined to do whatever it took to make that happen. If it meant she needed to hide her identity while exposing her physique to the internet at large in order to pull together the cash it would take to put a degree in her hand, then so be it.</p><p dir="ltr">So much of her life revolved around that little piece of paper for far more reasons than she could say out loud. It wasn’t just a showing of her accomplishments, or something qualifying her to obtain higher paying positions. It was an achievement after a lifetime of loss and heartache. It was for her brother, who died when she was nineteen. It was for her father who passed when she was twenty five, and for her mother who died a year later from nothing more than loneliness.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Rio was getting to live her own life, but there was always a <em>reason</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Her reason was making her family proud.</p><p dir="ltr">And that was worth doing anything in the world for. Even selling porn online with the hot woman she met at a bar that kind of felt like a friend.</p><p dir="ltr">She was quick in and out of the shower, fully aware that if they got through this little photo opportunity Agatha had planned, it was likely she’d be well rewarded for it. Quick as could be, she pulled on a pair of skinny jeans and a thin hoodie over a bare chest and slipped her feet into a pair of Toms before meeting the car parked at the curb.</p><p dir="ltr">In less than ten minutes, she was walking through Agatha’s front door to the most delicious myriad of smells she was sure she’d ever smelled in her life.</p><p dir="ltr">“No way you can cook,” Rio mused as she kicked off her shoes and met Agatha where she stood in front of the stove in the kitchen.</p><p dir="ltr">“When you prefer not to leave the house, it’s really easy to learn to feed yourself,” Agatha mused with a small smirk.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah, yes. Making yourself chicken piccata while all alone in your big house on a random Thursday night. I can see it now!” Rio was clearly being antagonizing, but Agatha only rolled her eyes as she knocked their hips together.</p><p dir="ltr">“My, my. Someone’s awfully riled up today. Keep that energy going as you pour us some wine.” It was a simple command as Agatha gave the pan a shake and lifted her chin toward the refrigerator to indicate where Rio would find the unopened bottle chilling.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, ma’am!”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, we are <em>not </em>roleplaying. Do not fucking call me <em>ma’am.</em> I’m not your elder. I mean. I am. But not like… Don’t respect me. <em>Dis</em>respect me, <em>please.</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">The more Agatha rambled on as Rio retrieved the wine and the corkscrew told Rio something Agatha would never tell her herself:</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe she was a little nervous, too.</p><p dir="ltr">“I will call you whatever you want me to call you, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">She perked slightly, as if an idea appeared at the forefront of her mind. While uncorking the wine, Rio studied her, trying to decide if she had <em>any</em> clue what was about to come out of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">“The gen Z kids are like, the sappy kind of horny, right?” she gushed, finally turning to look at Rio full on for the first time since she’d shown up.</p><p dir="ltr">“I mean? I guess. I stay off YikYak and TikTok and whatever other alliterated social media apps there are, so I don’t pay much attention.” Rio’s brow furrowed slightly as her eyes searched Agatha’s for elaboration, though she knew it was coming anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“Since we can’t use names when we film and calling each other animal names while we’re fucking, what if… What if we used ‘my love’ instead?” Even as she said it, Rio could hear Agatha bracing for the rejection or even humiliation at the mere suggestion. She wasn’t cowering, by any means, but she did not appear to be as… structured as she usually was.</p><p dir="ltr">Although there was a strong word there, as the pet name rolled around Rio’s brain, she realized she liked it. It wasn’t that it made her suddenly fall in love with the woman next to her, but it offered a sense of comfort and familiarity when they would be venturing into the unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s too much, right?” Agatha tried to supplement, as if it was too heavy of a suggestion to make.</p><p dir="ltr">With the lightest touch to the silk covering the small of Agatha’s back, Rio shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, I don’t think so. I think it’s perfect. It’ll sell it for those sappy kind of horny college kids, right? Anything helps.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ah, fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">There it was again: the pesky urge to kiss Agatha on the cheek.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Too much! Too much! You can’t be kissing her on the fucking cheek when you’re about the frequently be calling each other ‘my’ fucking ‘love’!</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>GET A GRIP.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio removed her hand and reached for both wine glasses, turning toward the living room. “Deadwind still or did you finish it?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Three episodes left! I’m telling you I’m right!”</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio placed the glasses of wine on the coffee table and picked up the remote, she knew it was the quickest way to put distance between them while also busying herself as Agatha finished and plated dinner. At the same time, Rio couldn’t pull herself away from just how quickly and easily it would have been to show some small shred of affection for the woman going out of her way to help, to offer kindness when it was outside of her norm. It shouldn’t be that fucking easy.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had thorns. She showed that time and time again and yet, Rio didn’t mind the prick and she didn’t mind the sting.</p><p dir="ltr">Handling Agatha gave her a thrill, one she couldn’t seem to stop chasing.</p><p dir="ltr">They ate quietly, Agatha offering soft snorts of approval when something revealed played toward her theories as Rio simply chuckled.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Those</em> were the soft moments.</p><p dir="ltr">The moments they didn’t have to be alone.</p><p dir="ltr">As they finished up, Agatha grabbed both plates and returned a moment later with the bottle of wine to refill their glasses.</p><p dir="ltr">“Just one more for now. Can’t have you drunk-drunk while we’re trying to basically build a photo résumé.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey! I’m not a sloppy drunk!” Rio called over her shoulder as Agatha retreated to set the bottle on the counter. As she sat next to Rio on the couch and lifted her own glass, the lightest smile filled her face as their eyes met.</p><p dir="ltr">“You are… a half-sloppy drunk, but it’s a two way street. So… To our new adventure. Let’s have fun with it.” She brandished the glass, holding it up in silent request to be met halfway.</p><p>“To our new adventure,” Rio conceded with a sweet smile of her own. “We <em>will</em> have fun with it.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes, Rio had this <em>feeling</em>. It was a weird feeling, falling somewhere between unsettled and discombobulated. It was usually a direct result of expecting one thing and being met with the exact opposite in the most unexpected circumstances.</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio followed closely behind Agatha (only slightly tipsy from two glasses of wine) and walked into her bedroom, she was hit with that feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio spent many a night in Agatha’s bedroom. She was familiar with the navy walls and gray paisley in-lay and how bare they were. She was familiar with the king size bed in the middle of the wall and the ornate dressers that lined the others. She was familiar with what she knew Agatha’s room to be.</p><p dir="ltr">What laid before her was still Agatha’s room, but in a way Rio had never seen it.</p><p dir="ltr">There were several boxes stacked on the dressers – their new wardrobe, Rio assumed – a couple of tripods at different heights, several different kinds of lights from ring lights to overheads, and three cameras laying on the bed neatly with their respective remotes placed next to them. As Rio’s attention lifted, she noticed something else, too.</p><p dir="ltr">“What the fuck is that?” she questioned as Agatha stepped toward the foot of the bed. She waggled a few fingers at the ceiling, causing Agatha to grin.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t even look. She knew what Rio was talking about.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s a mount. You know, for a camera. Overhead photos and videos have their own draw, you know? Good angles and all that.” Agatha was being so fucking calm about it all, but it forced Rio into a new realization.</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear Agatha would never head into anything uneducated, but she had clearly done an entire deep dive on every single way they could gain favor and attention with what they were doing.</p><p dir="ltr">Making porn wasn’t good enough for Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">It had to be immaculate.</p><p dir="ltr">It had to be perfect.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like the mask Agatha wore around everyone else.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio shuffled up behind her, peering over her shoulder just before she leaned forward and reached out.</p><p dir="ltr">She was so stunned by the appearance of the cameras she hadn’t noticed the two white boxes on the other side of them. When Agatha pulled one back wearing a giddy grin, Rio realized what she was holding.</p><p dir="ltr">Her gaze flickered down to the chestnut box and back up again, silently asking if she could open it. With a nod of encouragement from Agatha, Rio pressed upward on the lid of the box.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment it was open, she gasped softly at what lay before her.</p><p dir="ltr">In green velvet was a muted green mask, almost a shade or gray, in the shape of a deer head. The antlers were crafted to be a little on the smaller side, the snout just enough to cover the majority of Rio’s face, and honestly?</p><p dir="ltr">It was <em>gorgeous.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I know, right? Well worth every penny spent.” She pushed the box toward Rio, turning to the bed once it was out of her hands. As she lifted the second box, her grin was somehow brighter than before. “Look at mine.”</p><p dir="ltr">Popping the box open, Rio couldn’t help but marvel at how proud Agatha seemed to be, even before she looked inside.</p><p dir="ltr">In the second chestnut box was purple velvet and the most beautiful mask Rio was sure she’d ever seen in her life. Her was incredible, yeah, but she could already envision what the one before he would look like when it was covering half of Agatha’s face.</p><p dir="ltr">And Jesus Christ, did that make her throb.</p><p dir="ltr">How the fuck was she going to make it through a whole entire photoshoot when she was <em>already </em>turned on?</p><p dir="ltr">They hadn’t even taken their clothes off yet.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t even want to know how much you paid for these,” Rio snorted softly, glancing toward her own to revel in its beauty.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re right, you don’t.”</p><p dir="ltr">What an Agatha answer.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, Rio’s attention lifted again and settled right in those remarkable blue eyes. They were no longer filled with mischief and tomfoolery, but were rather soft. She looked… thankful didn’t feel like the right word, but maybe something close to it.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of pressing too hard on what might have been a sore spot, Rio took her mask out of the box and set the box itself back on the bed. With a little bit of care and some finagling, she slid it onto her face. The moment she was certain it was secure, her hands lowered and she turned again to take in the side of the woman in front of her.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, Agatha’s eyes were positively sparkling.</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio…” she breathed, a few fingers gracing the skin of her chest. “You look… Wow, you look really good in that actually.”</p><p dir="ltr">One thing Rio’s mask could not hide was the unmistakable grin that crossed her face upon hearing Agatha’s compliment. It wasn’t that she thought she was lying or overreacting, but Rio thought most of the time she was the… erm, ‘dumpier’ of the two of them. She took care of herself well enough, but her wardrobe consisted of mostly sweats and t-shirts and other lacklustre items to cover a body studying and working to the brink of exhaustion. So for Agatha to be so genuinely taken by her…</p><p dir="ltr">It felt really fucking good.</p><p dir="ltr">“You now,” Rio urged, tilting her chin toward the box still in Agatha’s hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Cheeks pushing higher with her grin, Agatha removed her mask from the box the same way Rio did and gingerly placed it on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, Rio fucking <em>got </em>it.</p><p dir="ltr">She understood every single bit of Agatha’s reaction.</p><p dir="ltr">Because even in only her house robe tied at the waist with her hair billowing down her back, Agatha looked goddamn priceless in her fox mask.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew from the very beginning that Agatha was attractive, beautiful, hot, and sexy, but right then it took every last reserve of her strength not to throw Agatha on the bed and declare they could do the photoshoot later that weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">Somehow, she did not think Agatha would approve of such a plan.</p><p dir="ltr">“So…” she mused, reaching up to cup Agatha’s jaw. <em>God</em> she looked so fucking…</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Foxy.</em></p><p dir="ltr">That was stupid. But it made Rio smile anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“So?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Are we going to unbox all the goodies at once, or do we go one by one as we take our little pictures?” As she spoke, Rio stepped forward into Agatha, wrapping an arm around her neck. Their masks were barely an inch apart and there was a rather smug smile on her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">It did not match the way Agatha’s turned down at the corners a moment later.</p><p dir="ltr">“What is it?” Rio asked, her brow furrowing beneath her mask.</p><p dir="ltr">“I just realized we won’t be able to kiss with these on.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t mean to, but she laughed. It wasn’t brazen or rude, just a soft chuckle as she reached up to set her mask atop her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“I realized that when you showed me. And I mean… We still can. With your fancy tripods and angles and editing, I’m sure. Or maybe pay for a blur feature on your editing thing. I’m sure it would be the least expensive purchase you’ve made.”</p><p dir="ltr">With a gentle hand, Rio reached up and slid Agatha’s mask up, too, just before it fell to her jaw again.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re the one who talked me into this. You can’t go looking for reasons to back out, now.”</p><p dir="ltr">The tiniest smirk fought its way to Agatha’s face and for the quickest second, she leaned into the touch. As her eyes started to flutter closed, she caught herself and righted in the next moment. Before Rio could keep up, she was removing the mask and placing it back in the box and then whisked away to the dresser.</p><p dir="ltr">Ah, avoidance.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio got too close. Agatha resumed business as usual to keep a modicum of distance between them.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come here,” she beckoned, opening the first of many boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio approached and peered inside, a warm smile found her. It was one of the pieces they’d ordered for her; a strapless corset-like piece that was a dark, deep green and trimmed with black lace.</p><p dir="ltr">“And what will you be wearing to match?” she posed coyly, bumping their hips together much in the same way Agatha had earlier in the evening.</p><p dir="ltr">“This,” she indicated, opening a second box. It was a soft lilac babydoll dress trimmed in lace, but with minimal frill. It was simple, but Rio could already tell by the neckline it would showcase Agatha’s chest quite nicely, especially paired with some kind of brassiere.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then what do you say we get changed?”</p><p dir="ltr">As their eyes locked again, Rio could see it in Agatha as much as she could feel it in herself:</p><p dir="ltr">The overwhelming urge to share a kiss of encouragement.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, let’s change.”</p><p dir="ltr">It could have been awkward to strip down and slip into lingerie in front of one another after a beat of tension, but the way they couldn’t seem to keep their eyes off one another told a different story. There were smiles and soft laughter, though the moment they were finished and full on staring at one another again, that sexual attraction seemed like the heaviest thing in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">“You know this is bullshit, right?” Rio whined, twisting on the ball of her feet. “You look so good and now I have to see you in at least three different get-ups and I don’t even get to fuck you. Or be fucked by you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What can I say?” Agatha cooed, stepping forward to run two fingers up the front of Rio’s neck all the way to her chin. “I am nothing if not a tease.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her grin was vicious and sharp, but Rio could only think one thing:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Ain’t that the goddamn truth.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Well then, where do we start first?”</p><p dir="ltr">“So happy you asked! Mask up and meet me over by that wall,” she instructed, waving a hand toward the bare wall. She was quick as she moved, snatching up a tripod first and then one of the cameras. After mounting it at a height that would be perfect for pictures of their upper bodies, she paused and glanced toward the bed and the two remaining cameras.</p><p dir="ltr">“I have an idea,” she spoke. Rio was in the process of securing her mask and glanced up, her question clear in her eyes, urging Agatha to continue. “What if we film the photoshoot? I can edit it up and we can price it cheap like… A teaser. Something to look forward to. Just… Us being us.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Us being us.</em></p><p dir="ltr">What the fuck did that even mean?</p><p dir="ltr"><em>They were a them now?</em></p><p dir="ltr">No! They were business partners. Maybe even friends.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>That’s. It.</em></p><p dir="ltr">That aside, Agatha had a point. If Rio could force herself to forget about being recorded and simply have a fun night with Agatha while they dressed up and put their hands all over one another, it could be lucrative, especially given what their first free post might end up being.</p><p dir="ltr">There was only one way to acquire a selection pool, so Rio gave a nod.</p><p dir="ltr">“I think it’s a good idea. But you also know way more about this than I do, so… I’m letting you steer the ship.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oooh, pirate talk. Don’t get me going. You’re already looking delicious in that bust.” Her voice was thick and sweet like honey, but the smirk on her lips wouldn’t go anywhere, not even as she put her mask on. She mounted another camera on a smaller tripod and set it at a distance, sure it was going to capture the majority of what went on in that room that evening.</p><p dir="ltr">She approached on light feet, looking positively jawdropping in her babydoll dress, and lightly pushed Rio to the wall with only two fingertips, getting as close as she could without causing their masks to touch.</p><p dir="ltr">“Relax.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was soft and soothing, the exact opposite of her touch, but it <em>worked.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio inhaled long and slow, closing her eyes for a second to center herself.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just them, having fun. Whatever they didn’t like never had to see the light of day. If they hated every last photo and every second of footage, she knew Agatha would be more than willing to scrap everything and try again. Because for as much as it was about Agatha fulfilling something she always wanted to do, she wasn’t going to keep going if it made Rio uncomfortable.</p><p dir="ltr">That was just human decency, but Rio appreciated it nonetheless.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha turned in front of her and backed up slightly, raising a hand to lightly grace part of Rio’s mask and part of her cheek at the same time. It was gentle, intimate, but it also caused Rio’s eyes to drop to Agatha. It didn’t seem to really matter that she couldn’t see much of her face; she was still just as mystified.</p><p dir="ltr">Instinctively, Rio’s hand slid around her side to rest on her lower stomach, pulling her back just enough to hold her close.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking the opportunity, Agatha snapped a photo. As her head turned and their eyes met through the eyeholes of their masks, she took another. There were soft clicks as they appeared to court before the camera with no ability to actually fully embrace what they both so desperately wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">But!</p><p dir="ltr">Rio came to a quick realization.</p><p dir="ltr">She placed both hands on Agatha’s hips and gave a firm pull to turn her around and dropped her head instantly, completely thrilled that with the way her mask was cut, she could still place kisses along edged parts of Agatha’s body, like her shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Click. Click. Click.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was having a fucking field day with that damn remote as Rio kissed up her neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“Making the most of what we’ve got, hm?” Agatha purred, tilting her head to expose more skin for Rio’s starved lips to feast upon.</p><p dir="ltr">“Always.”</p><p dir="ltr">After a few more photos and a shucking of the masks to finally indulge in a kiss, it was time for a wardrobe change.</p><p dir="ltr">And if Rio thought Agatha was sexy before in her little dress, the thought bounced even faster around her head as Agatha slipped on a lavender bra and boxers set patterned with the tiniest flowers. It was only so fucking sexy because of how comfortable Agatha seemed in it.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s a good look on you,” Rio informed with a touch of sincerity as she pulled the hunter green sheer slip over her head. When she pulled up the matching thong to go beneath it, she realized Agatha was staring.</p><p dir="ltr">“Right back atcha.” She licked her lips and spoke again. “The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can have our fun.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was almost like she was reading Rio’s mind.</p><p dir="ltr">They were practically torturing themselves by watching one another cycle through clothes that simply needed to be torn off, but Rio reminded herself there was a purpose. This was <em>business.</em> This was <em>work.</em> This was <em>money.</em></p><p dir="ltr">She needed to take it seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if doing that was <em>really</em> fucking hard when Agatha was so fucking attractive.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha again fiddled with a tripod, angling it toward one specific corner at the foot of the bed. When she was satisfied (though it took three glances to the display screen), she placed herself on the mattress and readjusted her mask. Her head tipped back and her eyes found Rio, sweeping down to her lap in command.</p><p dir="ltr">Another annoyingly persistent round of throbbing began between Rio’s legs as she made her way over and placed herself obediently in Agatha’s lap. Her palms were dug into the mattress, one hand clutching the remote, but she decided something about their arrangement made her unhappy.</p><p dir="ltr">So she tied her fucking hair up.</p><p dir="ltr">How did she <em>Keep. Getting. HOTTER?</em></p><p dir="ltr">It felt impossible to sit there, her hands on Agatha’s shoulders when all she wanted to do was wrap them in that damn ponytail and give a hard pull in order to feast on as much of her neck as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t do that.</p><p dir="ltr">She had to behave.</p><p dir="ltr">Wasn’t behaving for suckers?</p><p dir="ltr">Not when Agatha was taking this as seriously as she was.</p><p dir="ltr">As they stared into one another’s eyes, Agatha happily snapped photo after photo, catching every movement and new post. And then she did something unexpected.</p><p dir="ltr">She told a joke.</p><p dir="ltr">“You know, it really takes guts to be an organ donor.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was so unexpected that Rio’s only viable reaction was to burst into laughter. It was genuinely funny, but it was also a ploy from Agatha to get her to loosen up and to have photographic evidence of it when Rio ever got doubtful.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re so truly strange, Agatha Harkness,” Rio mused quietly, letting her arms drape around Agatha’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a quiet intimacy so heavy it drowned out the sounds of the camera. Rio didn’t care Agatha was taking photos, all she really cared about was looking into those gorgeous blue eyes, something a mask would <em>never</em> hide if she had a say.</p><p dir="ltr">“This is fun.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s grin was bright but instead of giving her a hard time, she simply nodded her head. “It is. What do you say we try out the ceiling mount next?” Her eyes drifted upward and Rio’s followed, her lips pulling apart slyly. It was certainly a new experience, but it was thrilling at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck it. If we’re gonna sell it, let’s fucking <em>sell</em> it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ten minutes later, Agatha laid out several items (a dildo, a bundle of rope, and a pair of handcuffs) across the mattress and Rio climbed into her choice bodysuit with a pair of thigh high stockings.</p><p dir="ltr">And Agatha…</p><p dir="ltr">Rio lifted her head and nearly choked at what she saw. Agatha let go of her mask to stand tall in her glory, chest supported with a black bralette that had a strap up the center of her chest that connected to a soft collar where the shoulder straps met, too.</p><p dir="ltr">She was in a pair of dark purple panties and over them, a leather harness sat snug around her hips.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio almost had a fucking heart attack.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, what the fuck? I knew you got one for me, but I didn’t realize you got one for you, too. Holy mother of Christ.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And let you look the hottest? Fuck off with that. This is my time to shine.” It wasn’t arrogant or haughty, but Agatha actually sounded like she was being playful. It was… nice.</p><p dir="ltr">Unnerving.</p><p dir="ltr">Soothing.</p><p dir="ltr">“Though… You do look <em>pret-ty</em> fuckable in that bodysuit. Can’t wait to take it off you when we’re done.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha reached forward and gave a gentle pull at the material before climbing on the bed to mount the camera she scooped from a formerly used tripod. It only took her a moment, but with one last tug, she was pleased with her efforts and dropped to the mattress.</p><p dir="ltr">“Last time I beckon you tonight, I promise,” she said as she gave the spot next to her a quick pat. As she did every time before, Rio placed herself obediently in Agatha’s orbit, taking the time to reach up for the elastic around her hair to free it once more.</p><p dir="ltr">“I like it better like this,” Rio told her, carefully leaning forward to press a kiss to her shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Click. Click. Click.</em></p><p dir="ltr">No cares, no worries, not a concern to be had.</p><p dir="ltr">Just them.</p><p dir="ltr">Being them.</p><p dir="ltr">They lightly reclined onto the bed, Rio giggling as she wrapped her legs around Agatha’s waist and pulled her close, holding onto her like she was the most important thing in the world.</p><p dir="ltr">If this whole little scheme actually worked, she just <em>might</em> be the most important thing in the entire world.</p><p dir="ltr">After several photos of several different poses with hands in different places, Agatha finally tossed the remote aside and reached up to remove her mask.</p><p dir="ltr">“Take that off and kiss me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Who was Rio to refuse?</p><p dir="ltr">For the millionth time that night, Rio did what she was told and lightly tossed her mask aside and slipped forward to straddle Agatha’s hips at the same time. Without another word, her head dropped and their lips met in a hot and hungry kiss; her payoff for being so fucking patient.</p><p dir="ltr">“Will you fuck me now?” Rio whined softly against her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t think you’d ever straight up ask.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Well. I am. Fuck me, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“With pleasure.”</p><p> </p>

<p><img alt="1000000770" border="0" src="https://i.postimg.cc/L4bWTY3z/1000000770.jpg"/></p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, they spent a grand total of twenty-nine hours together (though none of them ever between the hours of 4 and 10am).</p><p dir="ltr">They ate approximately five meals together, finished one show and started another, and fucked about eleven times.</p><p dir="ltr">They didn’t film a single round.</p><p dir="ltr">“Pictures first,” Agatha had insisted “It’s how we gauge interaction. Plenty of time for filming next weekend.”</p><p dir="ltr">She seemed to have a map of their business model in her head, something she appeared to be sticking to with intent. It was her plan, her pulling the strings, and with a divine-like intuition, she felt she was guiding them down the correct path.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had no fucking clue. She was just along for the ride.</p><p dir="ltr">There were certain times, a quiet moment on the couch or the post orgasmic haze of them laying next to each other where Rio almost asked a question. She didn’t only because she knew it was a dangerous question:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Why don’t you let yourself have friends?</em></p><p dir="ltr">It made no sense to her, enough to make her want to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was beautiful, she could be charismatic and charming, and was funny. She clearly liked the idea of companionship to the point of concocting a plan to keep Rio around. So why was it only her?</p><p dir="ltr">If they truly <em>were</em> friends, Agatha would eventually tell her.</p><p dir="ltr">…Right?</p><p dir="ltr">Monday was a return to a routine that was broken only by a weekend spent with Agatha; it was early morning coffee and hours of class and even more spent studying. It was a late night of coffee and whiskey, preparing for midterms</p><p dir="ltr">Tuesday was much of the same.</p><p dir="ltr">Until 7:48 pm.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio’s phone rang.</p><p dir="ltr">On the screen was something she was growing used to:</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Agatha Harkness</b> 😈</p><p dir="ltr">Incoming call</p><p dir="ltr">The plan was for Rio to come over the following afternoon to go over final revisions before they officially dropped their page and entered a world full of unknowns. They would eat dinner, drop the page and toast to their success with some type of alcohol or another.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the plan. A set plan. A good plan. A solid one.</p><p dir="ltr">So why was Agatha calling the night before?</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, Agatha,” Rio greeted, placing the phone to her ear. “Everything okay?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, yeah, everything’s fine. I just…”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha sounded different. It wasn’t a <em>bad </em>kind of different, per say, but the kind of different where Rio wasn’t able to immediately gauge how she was feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t sure she liked it.</p><p dir="ltr">Until Agatha continued.</p><p dir="ltr">“I was editing the photos and the behind the scenes video and it made me think about you.” Agatha was a sharp person, but right then, she almost seemed… subdued? Was that even the right word?</p><p dir="ltr">“Think about me? Or about fucking me?” Rio retorted with a light chuckle to try and break whatever weird tension had suddenly woven over the line.</p><p dir="ltr">“I mean, both, if we’re being honest.” Agatha’s laughter was gentle, but there was a tint to her tone that said she was finding herself again. “You’re still coming over tomorrow?”</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s the plan, barring I don’t get food poisoning between now and then of course.”</p><p dir="ltr">“So just don’t eat,” Agatha returned simply and Rio could practically envision the way she shrugged her shoulders as she said it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course. I’ll starve all day just to ensure I make it to your place as scheduled. You got it, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">They were both immediately taken by laughter, fully aware of how insane those words sounded strung together.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can’t wait for you to see the video,” Agatha segued the moment their laughter subsided. “I think it’ll be a good little ten dollar rake. When I finish, it’ll be about five minutes <em>and</em> I found a pretty good blur tool, even if I didn’t need it much for this one.”</p><p dir="ltr">There were several things Rio’s brain hooked onto in such a short time span.</p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha somehow managed to whittle down the hours spent on their photoshoot to a five minute video.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">She was clearly <em>very </em>excited to showcase the final product, especially given the price tag.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">She apparently included at least a portion of their night that evening where they were maskless and perhaps a little more intimate or in tune with one another.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">She was also insinuating there would be a need for the disguising of intimate moments in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p><p dir="ltr">She was not entirely sure how each one of those things made her feel.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t like she expected them to publish hours worth of content, or that it wouldn’t be top tier, or that Agatha wouldn’t find a way around not wanting to wear a mask the entire time.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just that she didn’t understand <em>why</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">The question came from her lips several times over the month and a half they’d known one another, and Rio had no reason to doubt Agatha’s answers, but it just felt like so much effort and for what?</p><p dir="ltr">What did Agatha actually want out of it?</p><p dir="ltr">Did it matter?</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t like Agatha would tell her anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“And you think it’s good enough to charge ten dollars a piece for access?” Rio finally asked, her voice only slightly skeptical.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s a promise of what’s to come.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was the most indefinitely definite answer she was going to get and she knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a beat of silence over the line, only broken by a question Rio wasn’t even aware she was asking until it was halfway out of her mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why did you really call, Agatha?”</p><p dir="ltr">The silence before the question felt natural, but the one after felt somehow different, almost like Rio had caught her doing something she shouldn’t have. It was probably the same type of regret Rio was feeling after her interrogation departed her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">“I just wanted to update you and see how your day was, is all.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Is all.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>See how your day was.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Did Agatha… <em>Miss her</em>?</p><p dir="ltr">Pressing <em>that</em> spot would probably end terribly.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio offered back what she could without causing any undue stress.</p><p dir="ltr">“My day was good, Agatha. Thank you for asking. And aside from editing photos and videos of us scantily clad and all over each other, how’s yours been?” It was neutral, in a way, but showed Rio cared in the same measure.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s been it. And my rose toy died. But it’s recharging.” Agatha let out a soft hum, a sound used to mask the way she wanted to burst into laughter.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment Rio broke first, it didn’t matter.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh! And I sold two hexes and a love spell! So, much to do tomorrow before you get here!”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">What a mysterious creature she was.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ve got a little more studying to do,” Rio informed with a soft sigh. “And then I do have a group project thing in the morning, so I <em>should</em> finish up and get to sleep but… I’ll come over as soon as I’m done. Does that sound good?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha released a discouraged grumble before clearing her throat. “It sounds unfortunately necessary. So, go. Finish studying and I’ll see you tomorrow, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">A small smile formed on Rio’s face and she exhaled a soft sigh.</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Have a good night, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could hear as Agatha went to lower her phone, but spoke just in time.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha! Wait!”</p><p dir="ltr">A little more movement, and then, her voice.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio chewed on her lip, debating saying what she truly wanted to say. Then, she said it anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you. For… For everything.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha breathed the softest laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“I promise you, Rio, it’s my pleasure. Get some sleep. Goodnight.”</p><p dir="ltr">And with that, Agatha hung up and Rio’s phone beeped to let her know as much.</p><p dir="ltr">Gazing at the screen only a moment longer, she set it down and resumed her studying.</p><p dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">That night, she fell asleep to thoughts of their photoshoot and how personal it suddenly felt after feeling <em>missed</em> for the first time in years.</p><p dir="ltr">Her dreams consisted of much of the same, even to a point that when she woke up, her first thought was Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">That surely wasn’t a good sign.</p><p dir="ltr">She was happy, though. That seemed to take precedence over everything else, especially as she went into her day.</p><p dir="ltr">Group projects always sucked for Rio, mostly because she was usually the one doing all of the heavy lifting. This time was no different. She realized as much when only one of the other four people even bothered to show up. They did what they could with the time they had and then, Rio was headed right back home to shower and venture off to Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">Just before she arrived, her phone buzzed in her pocket and she fished it out, glancing out the window of her ride as they turned down Agatha’s street.</p><p dir="ltr">A text, this time.</p><p dir="ltr">From Agatha, of course.</p><p dir="ltr">“Door’s unlocked.”</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, that was weird. Either Agatha really <em>was</em> having Rio followed, or Rio had simply become too predictable in her routine.</p><p dir="ltr">The latter was obviously more likely.</p><p dir="ltr">A minute later, she climbed out of the car, tipped the driver on the app and climbed Agatha’s steps to let herself in. As she shed her hoodie to reveal a black tank top beneath, she hung it on the door handle and lifted her head, grinning at what she saw.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was perched on the couch with her slippered feet propped on the coffee table. Next to them stood two resolute flutes of champagne and a bowl of fruit that appeared to be half-eaten.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, hello. You look busy,” Rio greeted, crossing the room to plop into her usual spot at Agatha’s side. She didn’t even ask before she reached forward, pulling a piece of mango out of the bowl, and shoved it in her mouth, peering curiously over at the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Make yourself at home,” Agatha deadpanned and for a moment, Rio started to think she overstepped.</p><p dir="ltr">And then Agatha fucking grinned like the asshole she was.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, really. Help yourself. I’m not going to eat it all. I’m just putting the finishing touches on the profile photos and the first photo post. If I look at the video again, I’m going to spend another three hours subbing out frames with unused footage and I <em>definitely</em> don’t need to be doing that.”</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio reached forward to pluck a couple of strawberries from the bowl, she also posed a question. “I know I’ve made an observation on this before, but you’re really going all out for this, hm?” She popped a piece of fruit into her mouth and chewed, though her critical gaze never left Agatha’s profile as she fiddled with something on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">The corner of her mouth twitched the tiniest amount and her brow furrowed slightly, her focus entirely on what she was doing (which was tweaking the brightness on one of the photos). When she finished, she turned her head to find Rio staring at her expectantly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Did you say something?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio sighed. “I did, but it was me saying the same thing I’ve said a million times before. So not important.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Says you. That depends on what you were saying,” Agatha returned, lifting an arm to rest on the back of the couch with her closed fist pressed against her jaw. Her eyes had gone from curious to devious in only a few blinks, her lips forming a smirk that caused a warmth to burn dully in Rio’s chest. “Take, for example, if you were saying I’m hot. That’s important. And absolutely needs to be said for the millionth and first time.”</p><p dir="ltr">Grinning instantly, Rio released a full laugh as she rolled her eyes and shook her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Right, how wrong of me. So let me make sure, this time… You listening?” she prodded, both vocally and a light finger pressing into silk and ribs.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, I am listening. Tell me how hot I am.” Agatha’s smirk wasn’t just a smirk. It was a full blown grin of pride and arrogance, knowing Rio would do whatever she asked.</p><p dir="ltr">“You, Agatha Harkness, are the hottest person I have ever fucked in my life.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But not seen?” Agatha returned, her eyebrow raising.</p><p dir="ltr">“What?” Rio questioned dumbly in response, not quite catching on.</p><p dir="ltr">She was slow; she spent the majority of the week learning the important shit. Sometimes, it took her a moment to catch up with her study-logged brain.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, finally, it hit her.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re mad because I didn’t say you’re the hottest person I’ve ever seen?” Rio asked, fighting to keep her face from cracking into a grin.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course she was. Of course Agatha wanted more, wanted it all.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well?” she urged, both brows arching. She was trying to be <em>intimidating.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It was just making Rio want to grin even more.</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright, alright,” she conceded, letting her lips part in a full and bright grin. “Agatha, genuinely, you are the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen. And…” Rio cleared her throat, but only to be a damn menace. “And I, a lowly pleb, am so lucky you let me between your legs.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha started to roll her eyes, but Rio didn’t see the rest of the gesture as Agatha’s entire palm covered her face and pushed her away.</p><p dir="ltr">“You <em>are</em> lucky to fuck me. But I guess I’m kinda lucky you’ve thrown some study sessions and OddJobs to the wind to let me make you scream my name, too.” Oh, so that was her way of making a girl feel special?</p><p dir="ltr">Eh, it worked for Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">“You do a pretty good job of it,” Rio chided, bumping their shoulders together. She craned her neck a little, looking down to the laptop. “How much longer to go?” she questioned, a little more seriousness to the way her voice sounded.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a little more typing as Rio watched Agatha type out the blurb.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>We’re hot. You have eyes. Now use your imagination or subscribe.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Sucking her teeth at her own humor, she submitted the blurb and scrolled through again.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s… It’s ready, I think,” Agatha stated, scanning over the page one last time. When she was finished, she reached for the laptop and lifted it, swinging it over to set it in Rio’s lap. For just a moment, she was confused.</p><p dir="ltr">“Aga–”</p><p dir="ltr">“This is to help <em>you</em>,” Agatha reminded her, reaching over to scroll down slightly. “So you get to do the honors. The moment you click that blue ‘Complete Page’ button, we’re up and available for the world to see.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s words were informative, but they were also comforting and encouraging. Rio appreciated the gesture; she had the most to lose in the whole scenario and right then, Agatha was giving her one last chance to back out. She was holding the door open for Rio and all but saying it would be okay if she wasn’t ready to walk through.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio was ready.</p><p dir="ltr">She was ready to move onto a new chapter of life, a chapter where she truly did things because <em>she</em> wanted to. Because she was living <em>her</em> life and could make any choice she felt necessary.</p><p dir="ltr">Paying for college was necessary. This was going to be a massive help toward accomplishing that goal.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio stared at the page and blue button before her with the knowledge that all she had to do was click it.</p><p dir="ltr">All she had to do was tap the mouse pad one time, and that was it. It would be done.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she could, she needed an answer.</p><p dir="ltr">Her gaze shifted to Agatha, who was watching her with a soft expectancy written on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are <em>you</em> ready? Rio asked her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t say yes, didn’t make some joke that she was ‘born ready,’ like Rio thought she might. She just reached forward and laid her hand atop Rio’s and gave a light nod.</p><p dir="ltr">Together, they clicked on the button.</p><p dir="ltr">With a flash to the next page, their live profile was staring right back at them.</p><p dir="ltr">Before Rio could fixate too long or truly look it over in detail past the header, profile picture, and first two posts, Agatha reached forward and shut the laptop before discarding it to the coffee table. Barely able to catch up, Rio turned to Agatha in time to see her shift and swing a leg over, settling herself in Rio’s lap with a champagne flute in each hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinning and rolling her eyes, Rio took one of the glasses and held it next to Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">“To our aspiring career as fucking pornstars, I guess,” she laughed, tipping her glass forward.</p><p dir="ltr">“To our career as hot as fuck pornstars,” Agatha agreed, clinking the rims of their glasses together. As Rio took a sip from hers, she watched with wide eyes and abject amazement as Agatha downed the entire glass.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio followed suit.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment both glasses were empty, Agatha set them aside and landed in Rio’s lap again, her arms draping easily over her shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">“What do you say we get in some practice before we start filming this weekend?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio practically lit up.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’d say ‘practice makes perfect.’”</p><p dir="ltr">“I like the way you think.”</p><p><img alt="1000000771" border="0" src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y0Yy08Lv/1000000771.jpg"/></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha’s lips always tasted sweet.</p><p dir="ltr">With a thin layer of champagne on them as Rio leaned up to press their lips together, they tasted even sweeter.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing it was a shared kiss of accomplishment and the first step toward celebration made them taste sweeter still.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re so hot,” Rio managed breathlessly against those sweet, soft lips.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>We</em> are so hot,” Agatha corrected in a growl before kissing Rio harder, hotter. She might not have been entirely wrong, but Rio felt that kiss proved her point more than it did Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">It was familiar at that point, the way their lips fit so perfectly together, the way Agatha’s tongue tasted as it roamed and licked at and devoured her mouth, the way her hands on Rio’s face were firm and strong. They were submitting to a varied routine where the <em>only</em> variations were which positions they ended up in and while Rio knew it probably wasn’t a good thing she had a routine sex life with someone she was not dating, she simply didn’t care.</p><p dir="ltr">It was impossible to care when she had Agatha sitting in her lap, wearing only one of her silk robes and literally nothing else. Not even a pair of boxers.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha knew what was going to happen that afternoon, that they would put their site online and celebrate properly. As such, she dressed accordingly.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s hands roamed the longer their tongues pressed and pushed and their lips smacked and sounded around them. They started on Agatha’s waist at first, sliding higher to cup her breasts through the silk and pinch at nipples – which produced the most delicious sound from Agatha – before they wound their way back down and around. Her fingers curled inward, still touching only silk and not skin, and pulled, effectively opening Agatha up to the cool air around them.</p><p dir="ltr">Or maybe it wasn’t cool at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was a thousand fucking degrees.</p><p dir="ltr">It sure felt like a thousand fucking degrees to Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">And then it kicked up to a thousand and one the moment Agatha gasped, severing their kiss. Her face fell immediately to Rio’s neck, but the moan that rolled out of her was too close to Rio’s ear for it to not have an instantaneous effect.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was right. More right than Agatha was.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Agatha was fucking hot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio was somehow the downtrodden, schoolwork-addled hobo who managed to bag her.</p><p dir="ltr">How that happened, Rio wasn’t sure she would ever fucking know.</p><p dir="ltr">“You like that, do you?” she asked, her voice low and rough. She could have waited on an answer, but one of her hands slipped inward from behind, the tip of her pointer finger finding its destination as it pressed lightly against Agatha’s entrance.</p><p dir="ltr">In a knee-jerk style reaction, Agatha’s hips canted downward in need, but Rio did not meet them in kind.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, she slid her hand right back to where it was.</p><p dir="ltr">And then Agatha bit her on the fucking neck – <em>hard.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Ah! Hey! What the fuck?” she scrambled, trying to pull her head away to question what the fuck Agatha was doing. Before she could, a careful tongue laved over the impressions in her skin and she relaxed, a quiet sigh leaving her. When Agatha hummed her reasoning for the assault into her neck, all Rio could do was roll her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tease.”</p><p dir="ltr">Of course. <em>Of course</em> that was why Agatha tried to Carmilla the fuck out of her. Because she didn’t get what she wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">Typical Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Get what she wanted or literally fucking bite someone until she did.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmm, and you think that’s how you get your way?” Rio questioned lowly, tilting her head away from Agatha to expose more of her neck. Without a word needed, Agatha covered the skin there in kisses and little nips, ones much gentler than her deliberate retaliation.</p><p dir="ltr">There was no precursor, no single indication of what was coming next until a loud crack sounded as Rio gave a heavy smack to Agatha’s ass. Instantly, her entire physicality practically melted into Rio, her hips dropping and working feveredly against Rio’s lap.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll come on you whether you help or not,” Agatha braved just before she sank her teeth into the lobe of Rio’s ear.</p><p dir="ltr">If six weeks had taught Agatha anything, it was how to push every single button Rio possessed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fucking hell, Agatha.” She needed no further prompting and dropped her hand from Agatha’s hip, letting it slide palm-up between her legs. The moment her two middle fingers met the pooling of Agatha’s arousal, Rio almost felt sick with lust.</p><p dir="ltr">And most assuredly, those sweatpants were going to need a wash before she dared to wear them outside again.</p><p dir="ltr">Attempting to busy herself, Agatha was still kissing and biting at Rio’s neck and ear, whimpering the quietest moans in all the best ways. That stopped the moment Rio pressed those two fingers inside her and curled.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh. OH Rio, <em>fuck</em>,” Agatha gasped, all but hiding her face in Rio’s neck as her hips began to work.</p><p dir="ltr">Ah, yes.</p><p dir="ltr">A repeat.</p><p dir="ltr">Nothing wrong with that.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio really fucking liked it when Agatha rode her fingers, leaked and seeped onto her palm.</p><p dir="ltr">All the more for her to lick up later.</p><p dir="ltr">“Couldn’t even wait for us to make it upstairs,” Rio murmured, matching Agatha’s rhythm as she worked in tandem and slid her fingers in and out of Agatha’s clenching core. She felt so fucking tight, but she felt so fucking <em>desperate</em> at the same time. It was the pulsing, the gripping, the tightening every time she curled her fingers into just the right spot.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha <em>was</em> hot. Sure, they could both be hot together, but the way she was moaning in Rio’s ear as her hips worked against the fill of Rio’s fingers deep inside her, there was nothing hotter in the world as far was Rio was concerned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Needed. Needed you. Now,” Agatha panted, finally lifting her head to loom directed in front of Rio, eyes half-lidded in her pleasure.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fuck, she was so fucking beautiful.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Ah, there was that pesky fucking word again.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been an accident out loud, one she was thankful Agatha did not call her out on, but one nonetheless.</p><p dir="ltr">Thinking about it, right then, part of Rio <em>knew</em> she was in trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">But that was a very, very small part and it was kicked to the side so she was instead able to enjoy Agatha riding her fucking fingers again for all it was.</p><p dir="ltr">With her other hand, Rio reached for the tie of the robe and gave it a firm pull that enabled her to push the robe to the sides, revealing Agatha in all of her naked glory.</p><p dir="ltr">She was such a fucking specimen, so perfect in her sculpting from the slight pudge above her hips to the little pouch Rio did her best to give no definition to (mostly because pointing out a ‘momma pouch’ was a little fucking rude, given Agatha had never said anything about kids before). It was hot to Rio, but she didn’t feel the need to draw attention to it. Agatha’s body was perfect in every way, shape, and form, and that’s all there was to it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Kiss me,” Agatha demanded as Rio’s hand cupped at a bare breast.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wasn’t going to say no to that.</p><p dir="ltr">With one hand full of Agatha’s cunt, one hand full of her soft and supple breast and her lips delving into the taste of champagne and delight and celebration, Rio was in fucking <em>heaven.</em></p><p dir="ltr">She was <em>happy,</em> she was <em>fulfilled,</em> and she felt like she was finally fucking worth something.</p><p dir="ltr">Because she could have Agatha, like <em>this,</em> even when no cameras were turned on.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just the two of them, sitting on Agatha’s couch while being completely unable to keep their hands off one another. Because it was just who they were.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hips fell out of rhythm, canting with a bit more force; Rio realized what was happening. She was going to come. For just a split second, she considered being a tease herself, making Agatha beg for it, but it didn’t feel right.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe another time.</p><p dir="ltr">This was a celebration, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">She was going to make Agatha come just as many times as Agatha was going to try to make her come.</p><p dir="ltr">It would surely turn into a competition, but she liked that about them.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come,” she ordered into their kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">It worked. Brilliantly, it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">The moan that tore out of Agatha vibrated every part of Rio’s upper body, filling her with an inexplicable heat that she knew not how to contain. It was bright and quick and hot, but she suddenly felt as though she could not get out of her clothes fast enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Shifting downward, Agatha took every bit of Rio’s touch she could, but did not move. Instead, she allowed for Rio to feel every single throb and pulse of her orgasm, as well as every bit of her release that trickled into Rio’s awaiting palm. When she was certain Agatha rode out the wave the best she could, she withdrew her hand and held it up, dropping her head enough to look over.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look at you,” she tsked softly under her breath. “So messy.”</p><p dir="ltr">And just like that, Rio raised her hand and gave one valiant swipe over her tongue, licking up every bit of Agatha she could. The moment the tip of her tongue left her skin, she was jolted back to attention as Agatha grabbed her face and kissed her with a white hot need that damn near burned them both up.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh fucking hell.</p><p dir="ltr">That was even hotter than hot.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could literally <em>feel</em> Agatha’s desire to taste herself on Rio’s tongue.</p><p dir="ltr">This woman was fucking out of her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">And Rio ate up every minute of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Having got her fill, Agatha pulled away, eyes half open in her pleasure but a smirk on her face all the same.</p><p dir="ltr">What a fucking fox.</p><p dir="ltr">“Take me to bed,” Rio requested, and Agatha did just that.</p><p dir="ltr">They got to their feet and not a beat passed before Agatha took hold of her hand, albeit a little roughly, and literally dragged her up the stairs. The moment they made it through the bedroom and stopped at the foot of the bed, it was only because Agatha pulled Rio around like a ragdoll and pushed her onto it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fuck. So. Damn. Hot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As she landed on her back, Rio’s gaze swept toward the ceiling and an instant grin filled her face.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha never took the camera down.</p><p dir="ltr">Following her line of vision, Agatha looked up as well and immediately stiffened with excitement. Her eyes dropped to Rio with a question in them, though she spoke it aloud at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">“Can I take pictures?” she asked and while she looked downright giddy, she also seemed sincere. “Just for us. Not for the page.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Just for us.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew <em>that</em> was just as fucking dangerous as thinking Agatha was beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr">But selfishly, Rio wanted her to. She <em>wanted</em> to see what they looked like caught up and tangled in their passion and desire. She <em>wanted</em> to see the look on Agatha’s face when Rio’s head was between her legs and she was coming on her tongue. She <em>wanted </em>to see herself face down, ass up on that expansive bed with Agatha making her scream.</p><p dir="ltr">So she agreed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Just for us.”</p><p dir="ltr">Stupid. Utter clown.</p><p dir="ltr">But sure, it was just for them, as friends, as fuck buddies, as two people who totally were <em>only</em> physically attracted to each other and nothing else.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was quick as she snapped over to grab the remote from her nightstand, shedding her robe before she reappeared at the foot of the bed, grinning like she was the cat who got the canary.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was her canary, and she could have her in any way she wanted her.</p><p dir="ltr">It started by getting her out of those fucking sweats. Agatha was a little hurried about it, but she was certain to take the time to kiss along the contours of Rio’s breasts and abs and hips with the removal of each item, grinning at the wet spot on the front of the joggers.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oops, I made a mess, didn’t I?” she purred, climbing onto the bed to tent herself over Rio’s torso, beaming down at her as she did so. In the distance, Rio could make out the softest clicks coming from above.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re gonna make more of one by the time we’re done,” Rio goaded. She lifted her head and stole a kiss, her hand winding around Agatha’s neck to tangle in her hair. She thought she had the upper hand, thought <em>she</em> was the one leading them along, but the moment Agatha flipped them over, she realized something for the hundredth time.</p><p dir="ltr">What Agatha wanted, Agatha would always get.</p><p dir="ltr">For some reason, that seemed to be Rio for the time being. And Rio was perfectly fine with it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Get up here,” she demanded, sinking her teeth into Rio’s bottom lip to give it a rough tug.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew what that meant.</p><p dir="ltr">She also knew for Agatha’s sake, it meant she should put on a show.</p><p dir="ltr">With one last slightly-sloppy kiss, Rio climbed up Agatha’s body and straddled her head, unable to curb her soft laughter at the hungry growl that sounded beneath her.</p><p dir="ltr">That woman was fucking insatiable. Incorrigible. Unapologetic.</p><p dir="ltr">Both hands reached for Rio’s hips, seemingly unimpeded by the fact that one was clutching a remote. The very same remote that signaled each clicking and shuttering of the camera above as Rio’s hips dropped and Agatha’s warm, wet, and ravenous mouth met her desperate core.</p><p dir="ltr">She moaned into the evening, her head tipping back as the camera clicked again above her. Maybe before, she’d been of the mind to make it into a whole show, but did she really have to? Enough time had passed that Agatha just <em>knew</em> how to please her, how to get the most out of her. She knew how to work Rio over until she was nothing more than a trembling heap begging for reprieve.</p><p dir="ltr">And she’d do it time and time again if Rio would let her.</p><p dir="ltr">The hand not clutching the remote pressed harder into Rio’s hip, fingers digging into flesh-covered bone. It was the most delicious kind of pain, an ache Rio wanted <em>more</em> of.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hips rocked and bucked, slow as to allow Agatha the room to do as she pleased. Rio could feel every single swipe of her tongue, every way she danced the tip of it around Rio’s clit in the most agonizingly delightful circles. She fought the urge to tip forward and grab the headboard, deciding instead to lean backward.</p><p dir="ltr">With grace and ease, her body arched and her hands landed on the mattress like props, holding her up on full display. She was bare from thighs to neck and as her hips worked against Agatha’s face, her chest bounced slightly with the motion. She could hear the clicking, but by that point, it was nothing more than a facet of their experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The longer Agatha worked, the closer Rio got, her chest heaving by the time she lurched forward and grasped at the top of the headboard, grinding down a little more erratically as she neared her edge.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha’s nails sank into the flesh of her ass, her hips rocked down hard as the pure waves of pleasure and bliss slammed right into her. It was an intense feeling, an incredible one, but as her eyes opened to find Agatha’s blue ones staring right back up at her all while sparkling with triumph, it somehow caused her cunt to clench a couple more times.</p><p dir="ltr">They carried on like that for hours, Agatha taking far too many pictures to count. It was more than just a romp, more than just a good time, but Rio absolutely wouldn’t acknowledge as much.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fun.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fun with a friend.</p><p dir="ltr">That was all.</p><p dir="ltr">Until they sidled up to one another, still naked as Agatha smoked a cigarette, and went through the photos.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew it was her body and Agatha’s body and she knew both bodies very well, but…</p><p dir="ltr">Some of those shots were actual art.</p><p dir="ltr">And it warmed Rio in a way she fucking hated.</p><p dir="ltr">She was growing attached.</p><p dir="ltr">She had to nip that shit in the bud or the only thing getting wrecked would be her emotional well-being.</p><p dir="ltr">There was school to worry about, and making money to pay for it. Agatha was being generous enough to help her with that and the <em>last</em> thing she needed to do was fuck that up before she hit her goal.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha put her camera down about ten minutes later, she picked up her phone.</p><p dir="ltr">The devious grin that filled her face was bright and immediate, her eyes sparkling down at the screen before lifting to look at Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">She was about to tell her they’d already made fifty bucks, but against her shoulder, Rio was sound asleep.</p><p dir="ltr">So Agatha set an alarm for earlier in the morning and let her sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Thursday night, Rio missed a call.</p><p dir="ltr">And eight text messages.</p><p dir="ltr">It was because she couldn’t hear her phone buzzing on the end table as she slept hard curled into a ball in the middle of her bed, exhausted.</p><p dir="ltr">Because she was two minutes late to class after waking up in a bed that did not belong to her. She’d fallen asleep at Agatha’s and Agatha did not wake her up.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t know if she was more upset with herself over it or if she was more upset with Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">It was avoidable. It <em>should</em> have been avoided.</p><p dir="ltr">They didn’t do sleepovers. For a reason. The <em>one</em> time Rio was irresponsible enough to fall asleep at Agatha’s, they at least didn’t share a bed. This time, though, she completely fucked up.</p><p dir="ltr">When she woke up that morning to an alarm that wasn’t her own, she was filled with a mixture of guilt and dread that she carried on her shoulders throughout the majority of the day. She felt guilty because she broke protocol; staying over was more intimate than what their friendship allowed and she never wanted to jeopardize that. She felt dreadful because she was not sure what impact it would have in regards to the carefully constructed house of cards their friendship was.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe Rio was in over her head.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, she definitely was in over her head and she only knew it because of the way her heart skipped several beats at the sight of a sleepy and pink-cheeked Agatha first thing in the morning.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t good. It was even worse because Rio was absolutely certain that whatever her attachment was? It was one sided. Had to be. No other choice.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was a friend. A kind friend, a generous one, but one all the same. She cared enough to go out on a limb, but not because she wanted anything in return, just to help.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, that was it.</p><p dir="ltr">That <em>had</em> to be it.</p><p dir="ltr">It explained the eight messages in her inbox on a Friday morning.</p><p dir="ltr">8:39 pm read, “Call me back.”</p><p dir="ltr">9:02 pm: “💲💶💲”</p><p dir="ltr">9:09 pm: "I really want to tell you over the phone. Call me back.”</p><p dir="ltr">9:12 pm: “Shit. You’re asleep.”</p><p dir="ltr">9:12 pm: “Fuck I’m sorry.”</p><p dir="ltr">9:15 pm: “Text me when you wake up.”</p><p dir="ltr">9:16 pm: “Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">6:29 am: “Are you awake?”</p><p dir="ltr">Still half-asleep and though lidded eyes, Rio typed her one word response.</p><p dir="ltr">6:31 am: “Awake.”</p><p dir="ltr">She barely had time to lock her phone and set it down before it was ringing in her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus Christ, couldn’t she give a girl time to wake up?</p><p dir="ltr">With a small smile she was barely capable of two minutes into consciousness, Rio answered.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmmmorning,” she hummed sleepily just before giving into a yawn. “Is something on fire?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha breathed a soft laugh over the line, warming Rio more than it probably should have. “Only our subscribers list.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s ears perked slightly and she rolled onto her back, her eyes still closed. “Yeah? And that’s what’s got you blowing me up?”</p><p dir="ltr">“In my defense, who the fuck goes to bed before nine?” Agatha’s animated tone was in direct opposition to Rio’s sleep-laden one; she was clearly excited.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, are you going to tell me a number, then?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Forty two. And thirty three of them paid for the video.” It was informative and matter-of-fact, but Rio suddenly felt like she’d been doused in cold water.</p><p dir="ltr">She was fucking awake.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha… Agatha, <em>what?!”</em></p><p dir="ltr">If she was being serious…</p><p dir="ltr">That meant, before minor deductions, they made <em>$330 dollars in about 24 fucking hours</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Objectively, it wasn’t some life-changing number, but the duration in which it was earned amplified the impact.</p><p dir="ltr">If they could make $330 off of no subscription fee and a behind the scenes video (which Rio realized she’d never actually seen)… what <em>couldn’t </em>they do?</p><p dir="ltr">“You… You’re serious?” She pushed herself off the mattress into a sitting position and the hand not holding the phone covered her face in disbelief.</p><p dir="ltr">“As a heart attack. I mean, I knew we were hot, but I didn’t think the number would climb so fast.” Agatha paused, her breathing sift but audible over the connection. “Since I couldn’t get you last night, I thought it would be a great way to start your Friday.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was sweet, really, but it made Rio wish she didn’t have three classes that day.</p><p dir="ltr">In reality, all she wanted was to go to Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">But that was a selfish want, something she had to curb.</p><p dir="ltr">She could. And she would.</p><p dir="ltr">At least a little.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha posed her next question, that was almost out the window.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you want to come over tonight? I’m going to post a couple more photos here in a bit so hopefully I’ll have an updated total for you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew she should say no.</p><p dir="ltr">But she didn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, I can come over after class. I –” She was going to offer to buy them dinner, but Agatha cut her off.</p><p dir="ltr">And what she said made Rio’s stomach drop.</p><p dir="ltr">“Pack a bag. You should just stay the weekend. We can film a couple of videos, I’ll keep us half-drunk and fed. It’ll just be easier than you leaving at three in the morning to come back at ten.” She sounded so goddamn cavalier as she unveiled her plan, but Rio herself was struggling to place how the suggestion was making her feel.</p><p dir="ltr">She <em>wanted </em>to spend more time with Agatha, always had, but the idea of them sharing close quarters for the whole weekend with little separation caused a spike of anxiety to lodge in Rio’s throat. Could she trust herself? Could she put faith in her own ability to remind herself that they were a pair of sexually platonic middle aged women who were making porn to pay off a hefty tuition?</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Not if you wake up to those pink cheeks for the next two mornings, </em>she scolded herself, though she was thankful <em>that</em> thought stayed in the house.</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio?” Agatha asked, causing Rio to realize she’d gone silent. “If you don’t want to, it’s–”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio interrupted her before she could talk them both out of it.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can. I will. I’ll pack a bag when I get back from class and then I’ll be over. Do you want me to grab us something to eat?” Even as she said it, Rio knew she very well could have been making a huge mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">But she didn’t care.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted more of Agatha’s time, more of her body, more of her hunger.</p><p dir="ltr">She just wanted more of Agatha, period.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll order us salads from the pizza shop. You still good with the antipasto and Italian dressing?” Agatha asked.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Agatha remembered her order. Even though they’d only ordered from that particular establishment twice.</p><p dir="ltr">That was… sweet of her?</p><p dir="ltr">Or, it was possibly something more dangerous Rio dared not let herself delve into.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, Agatha, thank you.” She lifted the phone from her ear and gave a soft huff, displeased with the time displayed. “As exciting as this wake up call has been, I really have to get up and get ready for class. I’ll text you when I head back here to change and pack. Sound fair?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha hummed her approval over the line. “Sounds fair. I hope you have a good day, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you, Agatha. You too.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Bye, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Bye. See you later.”</p><p dir="ltr">With the tap of a button Rio’s phone beeped twice and she dropped it to the bed before throwing herself back and releasing the loudest, most disgruntled groan she was capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">What was she <em>DOING</em>?</p><p dir="ltr">Going to Agatha’s multiple nights a week was one thing. Filming porn with her was also one thing.</p><p dir="ltr">But <em>agreeing to fucking spend the weekend with her?!</em></p><p dir="ltr">Yes, almost two months of friendship made the idea float by as a good one, but the truth was, Rio was losing trust in herself.</p><p dir="ltr">Feelings were not an option. Period. No questions asked.</p><p dir="ltr">So then why did she feel so warm at the realization that Agatha wanted more of her time, more of <em>her</em>?</p><p dir="ltr">No! It was just business!</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Just business.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As Rio readied herself and brushed her teeth, she stared hard at her reflection in the mirror, taking a mental assessment of her current circumstances. As she spat and rinsed her mouth, something crossed her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">They’d never discussed a split.</p><p dir="ltr">In all of Agatha’s scheming and plotting and planning, she never mentioned how much of the cash each of them would wind up with, not even a casual assertion of a 50/50 split. Maybe it was simply unspoken, but something about <em>that</em> detail being omitted struck Rio was… odd.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha wasn’t just going to give her everything.</p><p dir="ltr">That was stupid.</p><p dir="ltr">And Rio wouldn’t allow it.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha spent time and money and effort into getting it all right and she deserved her fair share of the return. It didn’t matter how much money she was sitting on (which, Rio realized, was probably a fuck ton more than she dared to consider) already, it mattered that she put in half (or more) of the effort and deserved half of the reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, maybe Agatha did truly just forget to bring it up. It was unlikely and Rio knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was a smart woman, too smart.</p><p dir="ltr">Which meant Rio needed to get better at playing dumb. The kind of dumb where she ignored her own wants and instincts and happily bobbed along on their predetermined path.</p><p dir="ltr">Not the kind of dumb where she let herself catch fucking feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why are you so fucking stupid?” she asked aloud, staring herself in the eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">The mirror offered no response.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio braced herself on the counter and shook her head, laughing under her breath. “At least we’re having fun, eh?”</p><p dir="ltr">With a defeated sigh, she pushed off the counter and finished her morning routine, opting that morning for a rideshare over her bike so she had time to drink her coffee in peace.</p><p dir="ltr">Her first lecture was ninety minutes, followed by a ten minute walk to the next hall, the one that held a two hour lecture. With only twenty minutes to grab something to eat and make it to her third class, Rio snagged a couple of sticks of string cheese from the bodega and booked it to the third building.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time she was headed home, she realized Agatha had not texted her once that day. It wasn’t wrong or anything, but it felt… weird. It was something they did almost every day, even if it was silly banter and crass jokes, or Agatha’s emoji coded tangents which were always a delight.</p><p dir="ltr">After making it home and climbing into the shower, Rio couldn’t help but laugh the moment she heard her phone sound from the counter.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course Agatha wouldn’t text all fucking day just to text her the very moment she couldn’t physically answer.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking her time despite her urge to leap out fully soaked to see what she said, she heard it ding two more times. That woman was something else.</p><p dir="ltr">Only, when Rio climbed out of the shower and dried off enough to pick up her phone, it wasn’t Agatha who was texting.</p><p dir="ltr">No, the contact read: J. Kale.</p><p dir="ltr">“What the fuck? Did she kill you? I’ve been checking the news and can’t find anything.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But I can’t think of another reason you haven’t stepped foot in my bar in two damn months.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Come in sometime (soon) and give me your money. Oh and let me know you’re alive. While giving me your money.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio let out a hearty laugh as she typed her reply.</p><p dir="ltr">“Alive. Busy. Will come drink you dry soon.”</p><p dir="ltr">She locked the phone as she passed into her room and tossed it on the bed so she could get dressed. It dinged twice in rapid succession. After pulling a baseball style t-shirt, she scrambled over to the bed and scooped the phone up.</p><p dir="ltr">Two messages.</p><p dir="ltr">One from Jen, one from Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen first.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, Agatha could wait.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Yeah.</em></p><p dir="ltr">And yet, Rio opened Agatha’s first anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Four images.</p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A screenshot of their account total: $380</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A longer one of the two new photos Agatha posted from their shoot.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A 4 second clip with no audio of them changing poses in the video</p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p><p dir="ltr">And lastly,</p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A photo Agatha must have taken that day in a new lace bra and unequipped gartered panty harness, though her face was out of frame even if her hair was not.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Fuckkkkkk.</p><p dir="ltr">Why was she so fucking hot?</p><p dir="ltr">At least for the moment, she was hot enough to make Rio forget any pesky feelings that might have been trying to claw their way up.</p><p dir="ltr">But Goddamn, did she have a hot as fuck friend.</p><p dir="ltr">And she was damn lucky <em>she </em>was the one getting to soak up Agatha’s time.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio should have replied that she was on the way and responded to Jen, but the sudden heat in her belly caused her to do something else instead. She quickly punched the phone next to Agatha’s name and brought the phone to her ear, her heart thumping a little faster in her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes?”</p><p dir="ltr">Typical.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re a brat. Did you just take that today? You <em>do </em>realize I can’t get there any faster, right?” Rio rambled, clearly flustered by at least one of the photos Agatha sent.</p><p dir="ltr">Surely she already knew which one.</p><p dir="ltr">“You could grow wings,” Agatha purred, her tone light and devoid of any guilt over sending the photo. “Or you could tell me you’re climbing into a car and on your way.” There was a dreaminess to Agatha’s voice, almost like she already started drinking, but Rio didn’t ask.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’ll be here in a minute,” Rio assured her. “I just needed you to hear me call you an asshole as soon as possible.” As she spoke, she was shuffling around the room and simultaneously cramming things into an over-sized backpack, suddenly in a hurry to get moving.</p><p dir="ltr">“So send the other three I took today too? Got it, got it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, I fucking beg you, do not put me in that position in the back of a fuckin Uber.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh,” she countered coyly, “I <em>like</em> it when you beg.”</p><p dir="ltr">Damnit. Damnit damnit damnit.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m hanging up now! See you in ten!” And with that, Rio disconnected the call and practically sprinted outside to meet her ride.</p><p dir="ltr">She <em>tried </em>to focus on replying to Jen, but 3 individual messages came through from Agatha, all images.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio did not fucking open them.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew better.</p><p dir="ltr">At least, until they turned down Agatha’s street.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, and only then, was she dumb enough to open them.</p><p dir="ltr">And holy fucking shit was she glad she waited. Only one of them contained a photo of Agatha in any type of garment.</p><p dir="ltr">The other two were her on her bed, legs spread with a hand between them, holding herself open with two fingers.</p><p dir="ltr">Good fucking GOD.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was stuck, staring, for so long she didn’t even notice the car had rolled to a stop and they were sitting outside of Agatha’s home. The second it hit her, she thanked the driver and tore out of the car, practically knocking Agatha’s door off the hinges as she blew through it.</p><p dir="ltr">Startled and alarmed, Agatha’s head whipped around from her place in the kitchen and wide blue eyes met Rio’s blackened and hungry ones.</p><p dir="ltr">“Cameras or no cameras, I don’t give a fuck. Get your fucking ass upstairs.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio paused, but Agatha did not move.</p><p dir="ltr">She just fucking grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Now.”</em></p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">“Can you give me three minutes?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha asked it before they even hit the landing on the second floor, which meant only one thing:</p><p dir="ltr">They were going to make their first video.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, Rio was too fucking horny to actually overthink it. As they crossed into the bedroom and Agatha set to work arranging the cameras and getting them turned on, Rio realized that was likely her intention. If she could get Rio so fucking riled up before she even walked in the door, it was going to take away from any anxiety or nervousness she was holding onto.</p><p dir="ltr">And Agatha was right.</p><p dir="ltr">“Go pick something out to wear,” she instructed, waving a hand toward her closet where their entire wardrobes for their escapades were stashed.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to, she really did, but it took every bit of strength she had not to torpedo right into Agatha, taking her down and feasting upon every inch of skin and cunt she could possibly get to. Agatha clearly had a plan in her head, a way this all would go and while Rio was nearly out of her mind with lust, she knew it wouldn’t hurt to listen.</p><p dir="ltr">So, hardly able to take her eyes off Agatha, Rio stripped her shirt and tossed it on the dresser on her way into the closet. After only a moment of debate, she selected a matching black bra and thong set, grinning to herself as she finished stripping and redressed herself. After another moment of contemplation, she rifled through Agatha’s things and produced the dark violet bra and panty set she told Rio was one of her favorites when they’d gone through everything.</p><p dir="ltr">If they were going to make their first video, Agatha was going to look damn hot doing it.</p><p dir="ltr">For a moment, Rio considered she could pick a harness out, but something stopped her. Perhaps it was the riding of Agatha’s wave; something in Rio told her that for their first video, the very first actual piece of pornography they were going to post, it didn’t <em>need</em> to be all about her getting dicked completely down.</p><p dir="ltr">In some way, her rational brain began to tick if only for a moment, pushing her to the realization that no matter what they did, it was still going to be hot.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio just hoped her mask didn’t get in the way.</p><p dir="ltr">That was going to piss her off.</p><p dir="ltr">Only for a moment before she realized Agatha could just blur her face.</p><p dir="ltr">There was only one way to find out!</p><p dir="ltr">Once changed, Rio scooped up her choice for Agatha and the boxes with their masks before making her way back to the bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">Where she found a naked Agatha awaiting her wardrobe for the evening.</p><p dir="ltr">“They’re all on already,” she indicated, waving a hand toward the two cameras on tripods and the one mounted from the ceiling. “I’ll edit what I need to, so just… be yourself. We can be us. I’ll scrap anything we don’t want shown.”</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the boxes were set on the dresser, out of frame, Agatha strode over, planting herself in front of Rio as both hands raised to hold her jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">“You look so good,” she purred with a smirk, leaning in to place a heavy kiss against her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had been complimented on her looks many times in her life, but there was something about the way Agatha said it, something about the way she was holding onto her that made it hit with a harder impact. It wasn’t so much the words themselves, but rather who they were coming from. Agatha Harkness, the most beautiful woman Rio was sure she’d ever laid eyes on, was praising her, telling her she looked good, and it felt fucking amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha didn’t <em>need</em> to inflate her ego or convince her of her appeal, but it was nice she took the time to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">In a weird way, it helped smooth over the nerves starting to bubble up in her the longer they stalled to prepare.</p><p dir="ltr">How could she be nervous when she had Agatha, completely naked, pressed to her with her tongue in her mouth? She was in heaven, no matter what way it was parsed. Even with the idea that at least fifty people might see what they were about to do, it was hard to be on-edge when Agatha was so damn present, such a vivid reminder that they’d both made this choice for a reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Because they were hot.</p><p dir="ltr">And when they fucked, it was even hotter.</p><p dir="ltr">It took Agatha less than a minute to pull on Rio’s selection – with a “It’s like you know me,” accompanied by a smirk – until they were unboxing their masks. Before putting them on, however, Agatha took another chance to grab Rio by the face (one-handed this time) and kiss her hot and heavy. It was almost sloppy in its demeanor, to a point where Rio <em>almost</em> started to think <em>Agatha</em> might have been the nervous one.</p><p dir="ltr">As quick as the thought happened, it disappeared as did Agatha’s hold, and Rio knew what happened next.</p><p dir="ltr">They happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like they always happened.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the masks were on, it became a game of what was possible and what wasn’t, all while trying to figure it out and not overthink it at the same time. Quickly, Rio remembered that shoulders and other edged body parts were easily accessed and unhindered by the slight snout of her mask, so that was where she began: her lips on Agatha’s neck as her hands gripped at Agatha’s sides, bringing her close.</p><p dir="ltr">She was measured and deliberate with her kisses, carefully navigating each one with intention as she reached Agatha’s ear, breathing a husky murmur directly into it.</p><p dir="ltr">“I want you.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was soft, but the sound equipment Agatha purchased would prove effective upon editing. It was something Rio didn’t think about, something she hadn’t considered, but right then she did not care.</p><p dir="ltr">All she cared about was getting Agatha on the bed and her head between Agatha’s legs. <em>If</em> she mapped it out correctly in her head, she <em>should </em>be able to put on a show without having to take off her mask. Maybe it was something they should have given more thought to, but right then, she didn’t care.</p><p dir="ltr">She meant what she said.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted her something awful.</p><p dir="ltr">Sharp teeth sank into the lobe of her ear, drawing a low and desperate moan from Agatha’s lips as Rio walked her back, thighs meeting the edge of the bed. It was so fluid and easy, the way Rio kept going, lowering her to the bed. It was effortless and simple, almost an automation. It wasn’t often she stepped up to direct their entanglements, but she wanted the other woman so fucking bad it almost hurt.</p><p dir="ltr">With the smallest smirk, Rio tipped her chin enough to silently request that Agatha move forward, toward the edge of the bed. With her in just the right position, their smirks were mirror images and Rio dropped to her knees, a hungry look in her eyes as they locked with Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck. Why was she so fucking hot?</p><p dir="ltr">Raising her hand between them, Rio’s gaze never moved, not even as she cupped her hand over Agatha’s warm and wet sex, pinching part of her panties between her thumb and forefinger. Watching her own mischief, Rio gave a light pull on the fabric, creating an intentional pressure between Agatha’s folds. Her head fell to the mattress in pleasure, a moan echoing out of her as a hand found the back of Rio’s head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look at you,” Rio hummed delightedly, leaning forward to swipe her tongue along the fabric.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s hips bucked and a soft whimper left her, clearly a plea for more that she could not seem to find words for.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio gave her more.</p><p dir="ltr">Carefully, she slipped Agatha’s panties to the side, licking her lips immediately at the dark, cum-soaked bush before her. She knew what a prize it was, how rewarding it was to be the one between Agatha’s legs and somehow, it was enough to make her forget what they were actually doing.</p><p dir="ltr">The cameras didn’t matter. The sound equipment didn’t matter. Hell, the masks hardly mattered. All Rio cared about in that moment was Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha Agatha Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing that mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">And so Rio did her best to make it known.</p><p dir="ltr">She was careful as she dropped, her thighs resting on the backs of her calves as she worked the angle out in her head; with Agatha’s thighs resting on her shoulders, it was easy. She shifted forward, her eyes sweeping up to the sight of Agatha’s head tipped back, her jaw dropping the moment Rio’s mouth met every drop of desire that had been pooling there likely since before Rio even walked in the fucking door.</p><p dir="ltr">She tasted so impossibly sweet on the tip of Rio’s tongue as it swept upwards, making the lightest contact with that tiny but powerful bundle of nerves for just a brief second. Agatha was immediately responsive, a soft moan hitting Rio’s ears as her hips shifted downward in search of more.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha wanted more, Rio would give her more.</p><p dir="ltr">What started as nothing more than a tease garnered more pressure, a flat tongue swiping from entrance to clit as Rio took her time to listen to what Agatha’s body was telling her.</p><p dir="ltr">And it was telling her what she already knew:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>More. More. More.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Her pace quickened for a moment before changing tactics, a few kitten licks directly to Agatha’s clit causing her to grip at Rio’s hair as she writhed. It was needy, it was fucking desperate, and Rio was eating every last bit of it up, quite literally.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t think about the camera to the right, behind her, nor did she think about anything that wasn’t the woman right in front of her. None of it was of any relevance when Agatha was fighting the way she wanted to shove Rio’s face further into her cunt.</p><p dir="ltr">For as much of an effort as Rio was putting in, Agatha met it in kind. Her hips began to shift and lift, cant and buck as the feeling of Rio’s tongue slipping into her clenching and tight cunt seemed to almost sink her. She was panting, the neediest and most pathetic whimpers falling from her as she neared her edge.</p><p dir="ltr">The very second her head lifted and those wet, desperate, blue eyes fell into Rio’s practically black ones, Rio knew she was <em>so, so</em> close.</p><p dir="ltr">To push her along, a deep, loud moan sounded against her body, Rio’s tongue still buried inside of her.</p><p dir="ltr">It fucking worked!</p><p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Agatha’s entire body stilled.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, her thighs snapped around Rio’s head like a vice as her hips jolted up off the bed. More than that, Rio could feel every spasm and clench of Agatha’s cunt around her tongue, causing her own body to thrum with arousal. The sound of Agatha’s moans and cries cut through the room like a knife, her fingers wound so tightly in Rio’s hair she was certain more than a few strands were pulled loose.</p><p dir="ltr">It was not the first time Rio ever made Agatha come, but it was certainly the first time she’d been <em>so</em> responsive. She was always hot, always made Rio come unglued at the fucking seams, but right then, it was almost unbearable.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever the fuck she’d done in her life to end up between the legs of Agatha Harkness, she thanked her lucky stars for.</p><p dir="ltr">As Agatha’s chest heaved and her breathing began to even out, Rio pulled away but only to carefully leave kisses up her side, over the outside of her breast, all the way to her shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Been waiting for that, have you?” she purred, lightly running the tip of her tongue along Agatha’s shoulder to her neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“Y-yes,” Agatha panted in return, her head lulling slightly as if she wanted to kiss the side of Rio’s head, but then realized she couldn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">“But,” Rio mused, carefully running her tongue along the shell of Agatha’s ear. “If I know you, it’s not the only thing you’ve been waiting for.”</p><p dir="ltr">A low, amused chuckle came from somewhere deep in Agatha’s chest as her hand found Rio’s hair again, pulling her back to meet her gaze. There in those bright blue irises was a fire unlike any Rio had seen before. It was hot and bright, burning with so much lust she hardly knew how to describe it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Lucky for you,” Agatha growled, leaning up to angle her head in <em>just</em> the right way so she could slip the tip of her tongue beneath Rio’s top lip. “We’ve got some time.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Lucky for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was all teeth, a devious grin wide and bright as she flipped them over, her knees landing on either side of Rio’s hips as her hands found Rio’s stomach.</p><p dir="ltr">“But even luckier for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha said it like she meant it, but Rio knew it wasn’t true.</p><p dir="ltr">Of the two of them, in that moment, she <em>knew</em> with absolute certainty that to even be in Agatha’s orbit?</p><p dir="ltr">It made her the luckiest person alive.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Hot.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was fucking <em>hot</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t just the lingerie or the fact that she could still taste Agatha’s desire on her lips. It wasn’t even the fact that she could have kept it up all fucking night.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio <em>actually, truly, genuinely </em>felt like she was going to burn up from the inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Self-sustained heat, melting its way out from her very fucking core.</p><p dir="ltr">All because Agatha was hers for the taking and the same was equally true. It had been true the moment Agatha sat next to her in Jen’s bar and Rio knew that sentiment was not likely to change?</p><p dir="ltr">How could it when Agatha was all Rio’s sexual appetite could ever need? She was fit, breathstoppingly gorgeous, and had the arrogance to match. Agatha <em>knew</em> she was some sort of prize to be won, but she was the only vote to decide the winner.</p><p dir="ltr">She apparently felt Rio worthy of a grand fucking prize.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>So </em>worthy it was worth sharing with the internet, or at least anyone with an OnlyFans account with money to burn.</p><p dir="ltr">Money Rio could use to build a better life.</p><p dir="ltr">Money Agatha could use… for whatever the fuck she couldn’t already purchase, which didn’t seem like much at that point.</p><p dir="ltr">But it wasn’t about the money for Agatha, not really. It was about their fun, their escapades, their entanglements. Rio could tell that much.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe for her, money was the motivating factor.</p><p dir="ltr">But for Agatha?</p><p dir="ltr">Well, there would be plenty of time over the weekend to parse out her motivations. Hell, maybe Rio might even get her to be <em>honest</em> about it. Not likely, but worth a try, right?</p><p dir="ltr">In the moment, with Agatha looking at her through sharp, hot, blue eyes Rio knew the last thing she wanted was a conversation. In fact, with the way she licked her lips, Rio had to wonder if Agatha was missing their hot, sloppy kisses as much as she was.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment Agatha leaned over her and took hold of her jaw again (much the same way she had before), Rio could very clearly see the answer. Even more was the way Agatha – not as hindered by the shape of her mask – placed several deliberate kisses along the edge of Rio’s jaw, all the way to her neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“So sexy,” she breathed, her free hand coursing up Rio’s torso to wrap around her throat. A surprised gasp left her as both her neck and back arched into the touch, an intense heat washing over her.</p><p dir="ltr">If she felt hot before, right then she was on fucking fire.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt <em>so</em> hot that for only a second, she wondered if spontaneous combustion was real.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, Agatha licked her way down Rio’s neck and she was almost convinced it was not only real, but a very likely possibility for her if she didn’t find relief immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">Her lips parted, Agatha’s name almost spilling off them before she caught herself and changed course, remembering their audience of three rolling cameras.</p><p dir="ltr">“My love,” she whined, desperate hips bucking into Agatha atop her. “<em>Please.</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">At the mention of the pet name they both clearly discussed and approved, Agatha leaned back to peer down, a wicked and delighted grin pulling back to reveal nothing but white, pointed, sharp teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">She liked it. Maybe more than she thought she was going to.</p><p dir="ltr">If she had the ability to think rationally about it, Rio would have realized she liked saying it, too. It certainly would have sucked her out of the moment and tossed her directly into a doom spiral; it was a damn good thing she was too driven by her carnal desires to give it much thought.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hands and knees, edge of the bed,” Agatha murmured in command, reaching with a pointed finger to run a steady line down the center of Rio’s torso. A second later, she was up and on her feet, tipping her chin to reiterate her order.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t have to tell Rio twice, that was for damn sure.</p><p dir="ltr">Quickly, she did as she was told, rolling over onto her stomach before pushing herself up to her hands and knees and scooting back. The moment she reached the exact right spot, she was informed with two warm hands sliding over her ass.</p><p dir="ltr">God, it felt like fucking heaven to be touched by Agatha that way.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t get enough.</p><p dir="ltr">For as much as Agatha had been wanting more, Rio knew she could never get enough.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a shuffling behind her as Agatha’s hands wandered and dropped, as she did when she sank to her knees.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, Rio gave due thought to putting on a show, but Agatha?</p><p dir="ltr">It was all she did; putting on a show was essential to her very being.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was just fucking thrilled to be on the receiving and of it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck,” came a soft hiss from behind her, drawing a whimper in response as Agatha’s finger hooked beneath the string of her thong and pulled it aside. “All for me?”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a question that <em>could</em> have had an immediate answer, but before Rio could form it, she felt a lone fingertip brush <em>just barely</em> between her folds, not actually making contact with anything that mattered. It still caused Rio to buckle forward, supporting herself on her forearms as a weak moan sounded around them.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, what a fucking tease.</p><p dir="ltr">“All. All for you,” Rio forced out, sucking in a sharp breath as Agatha repeated her previous motion, that time with two fingers instead of one.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck, R-my love,” Agatha marveled, reaching forward with both hands to press and pull, completely exposing Rio’s soaked and slick cunt and every drop of her unyeilding lust. “So needy.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Needy. Need you,” she all but begged, her hips shifting back in a desperate plea.</p><p dir="ltr">The reward she was hoping for?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s mouth, her lips, her tongue in the only place that mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">The punishment she got?</p><p dir="ltr">A swift and sharp smack to the meat of her ass, causing her to yelp first and then moan, long and loud.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck, why did that feel so fucking good?</p><p dir="ltr">“My love, please. Pleasepleaseplease,” Rio attempted again, but kept her hips in place despite her slight squirming.</p><p dir="ltr">“Only because you asked so nicely.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha said it like she was giving Rio what she wanted, but it could never be so easy.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio realized it the second she felt Agatha’s fingers slide forward from the left, first applying a firm pressure to her entrance before dragging down. The moment she began to run firm but small circles around Rio’s clit, her hips shifted back and a soft whimper left her.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt good, <em>so fucking good</em>, but it wasn’t what she wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted to call out, to say Agatha’s name in her next series of please, but for all the haze of her need and desire, she bit it back.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Please, baby.</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh.</p><p dir="ltr">Shit.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn’t discussed.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuckfuckfuck</p><p dir="ltr">In a brief flash of crisis, Rio started to debate how badly she fucked up. It would have been a quick jaunt into the abyss, but something stopped her.</p><p dir="ltr">A snide laugh and the sudden feeling of Agatha’s mouth on her cunt.</p><p dir="ltr">Ohhhhhh, fuuuuuuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby who?</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever happened eight seconds prior no longer mattered. The only thing that mattered to Rio right then was the way Agatha's tongue was slowly and deliberately dragging through the length of her cunt, tasting every bit of her she could reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Strong and searching fingers wound in navy sheets and the white comforter, her knuckles matching in shade as she gripped and pulled.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt so goddamn good right then that everything else? It was automatic.</p><p dir="ltr">The whimpers, whines, and moans? Automatic. The clawing of the bed sheets? Automatic. The way her pussy pounded harder with each swipe of Agatha’s tongue? Automatic.</p><p dir="ltr">It was easy, like breathing, and Rio couldn’t stop.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t want to stop.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, her hips began to work back into the feeling of Agatha’s mouth, needing more of her, more of anything she might be willing to give.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio felt the pad of Agatha’s thumb press intentionally against her asshole, she almost crumbled then and there.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, maybe Rio hadn’t quite braced herself for <em>all</em> Agathe might be willing to give.</p><p dir="ltr">But fuck if it didn’t set her alight for the second time that night.</p><p dir="ltr">She released a loud, deep, and primal moan, one that lasted even longer when two of Agatha’s fingers pressed into her core and her tongue’s sole focus became Rio’s clit.</p><p dir="ltr">She was going to burst into flames.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Or, she was going to cum before that happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, for the sake of not burning Agatha’s house to the ground, the latter happened first.</p><p dir="ltr">Fucking Agatha was <em>always</em> rewarding in the best ways, but as Rio toed and then leapt over the edge of her orgasm, it felt like transendence.</p><p dir="ltr">Her body seized and shook, the pleasure leaving her in a moan so loud she startled even herself, her face dropping into the mattress to stifle the sound.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, no,” Agatha scolded, tutting her tongue, “let me hear you.”</p><p dir="ltr">To accentuate her point, she kept a steady rhythm as her fingers pumped in and out of Rio’s still-pulsing cunt. Her head whipped back, another moan ripping out of her as her orgasm rolled through its final waves.</p><p dir="ltr">And, as if that weren’t enough, one last cry filtered directly into the mics as Agatha’s teeth sank into the flesh of her ass, hard enough to bruise (as was intended, she was sure) but not hard enough to break skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus Christ.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha Harkness was going to be the fucking death of her.</p><p dir="ltr">With one last slap to the opposite ass cheek as a literal ‘pat on the ass,’ Agatha climbed to her feet and set about turning everything off, leaving Rio a spent pile on the bed as she took off her mask and set it aside.</p><p dir="ltr">Collecting it before adding her own, Agatha set them on the nightstand and gave Rio a light nudge, urging her up the bed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Catch your breath. Water’s on the bedside table. I’m going to shower.” Agatha’s tone wasn’t harsh by any means, but Rio still had to stop herself from asking a forbidden question:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Can I join you?</em></p><p dir="ltr">That was fucking stupid. Laughable. Far too intimate.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll be here,” Rio murmured, rolling to her back with a shallow yawn.</p><p dir="ltr">For just a moment, Agatha stopped at the foot of the bed, a too-soft smile on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“That was fun.”</p><p dir="ltr">“It was,” Rio agreed. “We should do it again sometime.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed.</p><p dir="ltr">“I plan on it.”</p><p dir="ltr">With that, she turned on the heel and disappeared into the bathroom, leaving Rio in the quiet of the night, her eyes sliding shut against her will.</p><p dir="ltr">When her eyes opened a few moments later, it was not a few moments later at all. In fact, the time on the digital clock read 1:18 am.</p><p dir="ltr">Shit.</p><p dir="ltr">She fucking fell asleep.</p><p dir="ltr">Accident.</p><p dir="ltr">But… apparently not a terrible one, given Agatha was not in bed.</p><p dir="ltr">So where the fuck could she be at one in the morning?</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio pushed herself up, something dawned on her.</p><p dir="ltr">She was both naked and covered up, wrapped snugly in the blankets.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had undressed her and tucked her in.</p><p dir="ltr">God, that was fucking embarrassing.</p><p dir="ltr">With a quiet grumble, Rio pulled her underwear on again and rifled through a few shirts in Agatha’s closet, snagging a black t-shirt off a hanger. Easily, she pulled it over her head and content with her wardrobe, made her way downstairs.</p><p dir="ltr">As she reached the last few steps, she was greeted by a fully lit living room, a robed Agatha perched on the couch with her laptop open on her legs. From Rio’s vantage point, it sure looked like she was watching their earlier escapades, a cockeyed set of headphones on her head</p><p dir="ltr">“What’cha doin?” Rio sing-songed, causing Agatha’s head to snap back in attention.</p><p dir="ltr">A bright grin filled her face, mischief sparkling in her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Editing!”</p><p dir="ltr">Of course she was.</p><p dir="ltr">“Considered grabbing a vibrator, but didn’t want to get too distracted.”</p><p dir="ltr">With a soft laugh, Rio folded over the back of the couch as she put her weight on her forearms, peering over her friend’s shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">There, on the screen before them, was a paused still of Rio with her head between Agatha’s legs.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck. Even <em>she </em>was turned on by it and it was <em>her.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Maybe Agatha had been right to make the suggestion of posting their sex life.</p><p dir="ltr">If Rio’s engines were revving back up, there was sure as fuck going to be an audience who would feel the same.</p><p dir="ltr">“There’s snacks in the cabinets and our dinner is in the fridge. Help yourself. I’m going to work on this a little longer.” As Agatha’s head turned to get a good look at her, an impulse flared in Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted to kiss her.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted to thank her, kiss her, and make her way into the kitchen.</p><p dir="ltr">But that was dumb as fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">You didn’t kiss a friend as a fucking thanks.</p><p dir="ltr">Christ.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you,” she voiced, pushing off the couch. Part one done, part two skipped, and part three completed as Rio shuffled into the kitchen to find something to sate her hunger.</p><p dir="ltr">A minute later, she appeared in the living room with a bottle of water and a bright red bag, a grin on her face as she plopped down next to Agatha and appeared to be only mildly interested in what she was working on.</p><p dir="ltr">It only took about thirty seconds for Agatha to look over at what she was doing, dissolving into laughter the moment Rio lifted her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“What?!” she shrieked through her own laughter. “You can’t tell me you’ve never worn Bugles like witch nails in your life!” As if to accentuate her point, she let out a devious cackle that melted into sheer delighted laughter.</p><p dir="ltr">“I keep forgetting you’re in your late thirties. You <em>act</em> like a college kid.” Agatha was <em>trying </em>to insult her, but her little smirk gave her away.</p><p dir="ltr">“And you keep fucking me. Whose maturity is actually in question here?”</p><p dir="ltr">A hand lifted from the laptop and covered the entirety of Rio’s face, pushing her into the couch cushions.</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t push it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“But I <em>can </em>and it won't turn you off.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha grumbled, her knee bumping into Rio’s.</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t be right. I’d hate that.”</p><p dir="ltr">As their eyes met, to prove her point, Rio raised her hand and chomped on one of the crisps, her giggles brimming out from behind closed lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though Agatha’s eyes rolled and she turned her attention back to the screen, Rio knew one thing.</p><p dir="ltr">They <em>both</em> knew she was right.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just yet to be determined if it was a good thing or a bad one.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Even before she agreed to pack a bag, Rio <em>knew</em> staying over at Agatha’s wasn’t exactly making the list of ‘good ideas’ she’d managed in her life and yet, she did it anyway. And Saturday morning, when she woke up flat on her back with an arm around her waist, she knew why.</p><p dir="ltr">She just hated admitting it.</p><p dir="ltr">They were <em>friends.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>And</em>, if Rio were being honest with herself, it was probably best for both of them to stay that way. It wasn’t necessarily that Rio thought it would end their friendship if something went sour, but more that Rio understood who they were as people and where they were in their lives.</p><p dir="ltr">She was up shit creek without a paddle, floundering to scrape up enough cash to graduate.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was…</p><p dir="ltr">Well, she was guarded as fuck, first of all. Even after months of getting to know one another, Rio didn’t <em>actually</em> know all that much about her. It was by design, she was sure, as Agatha could have chosen to share anything she wanted at any given moment and Rio would have been receptive, but…</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t fair to expect that from her when Rio was not willing to do the same.</p><p dir="ltr">The last thing she needed was to trauma dump to Agatha about how hard life was, or how she spent over a decade looking after one family member or another. Her brother and his accident. Her father and his stroke. Her mother and her loneliness. It was one happenstance after another, pulling Rio away for far too long from a life she <em>dreamed</em> of living.</p><p dir="ltr">She had such a life, but it was being threatened by fucking capitalism. It wasn’t enough for her to pull good grades, to be at the head of the class, at least not when money was involved. All that mattered was lining the pockets of the institutions and doing whatever she needed to in order to get her hands on that degree.</p><p dir="ltr">She was trying. She was clearly trying, and the woman who was sound asleep on her stomach with her arm across Rio’s stomach was doing her best to help. For what reason, Rio still had no clue, but it still meant something.</p><p dir="ltr">After a little longer, Agatha finally stirred and they set about their day, which first consisted of breakfast, coffee and light conversation about their plans for the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Which, really, weren’t plans at all.</p><p dir="ltr">“We could do another one today,” Agatha offered as she took a bite of her English Muffin. “Or we could wait until tomorrow. Up to you.”</p><p dir="ltr">It <em>would</em> have been ideal to just get it out of the way and have the rest of the weekend to do whatever they wanted, but something in Rio felt the need to stall. Maybe it was because she felt like Agatha might kick her out sooner than planned if they wrapped up their workload before half the weekend was even over.</p><p dir="ltr">“Let’s do it tomorrow,” Rio suggested, washing it away with a sip of coffee. “I haven’t had a day to just… decompress in a while.”</p><p dir="ltr">Such an honest admission earned her one thing: a prodding fingers to the ribs.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t help you decompress?” Agatha was trying to sound hurt and offended, but the twinkle in her eyes was giving her away.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, stop it,” Rio returned with a gentle push. “We have fun. But it’s not the same thing as melting into any sitting or laying surface.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha apparently spoke before her brain actually caught up.</p><p dir="ltr">“You could always melt into me.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was playful and light, but the actual words themselves were anything but.</p><p dir="ltr">The silence was immediate and both pairs of eyes diverted to the television.</p><p dir="ltr">It was awkward. Too awkward. There had to be a way to save it.</p><p dir="ltr">“You gotta wait for that until tomorrow,” Rio offered, lightly bumping Agatha’s thigh with her toes due to how they were sitting.</p><p dir="ltr">“Have I ever told you I hate waiting for things?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Maybe once. But… I promise I’ll make it worth it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You always do.”</p><p dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">Much to Rio’s delight, they did almost nothing all day long, not limited to Agatha allowing her to soak in the massive clawfoot bathtub in the upstairs bathroom. She could have stayed there forever, contentedly surrounded by lavender oil and light bubbles, the tension leaving her muscles the longer she became one with the water.</p><p dir="ltr">When it was finally too cold to stand and most of the bubbles dissipated, Rio climbed out and dried off, dressing herself in typical house wear of a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, her hair still wet and thrown together in a loose bun. As she made her way out into the hallway, she realized something.</p><p dir="ltr">Something smelled really fucking good.</p><p dir="ltr">It was herby, garlicky, and a sheer delight to inhale.</p><p dir="ltr">When she reached the bottom step and turned toward the kitchen, she found the source.</p><p dir="ltr">A plate of alfredo and toast on the counter next to a very proud looking Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">“I figured we eat out all the time. And I <em>do</em> kind of know how to cook. So… I got bored.”</p><p dir="ltr">Right.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure.</p><p dir="ltr">Bored.</p><p dir="ltr">Uhuh.</p><p dir="ltr">Liar.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio was in absolutely no position to be calling her out for it. More than that, Rio wanted to ignore the deeper implications there; Agatha was doing it because she wanted to be kind, not because there was some mutual undercurrent of feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">No, that shit was completely one sided and Rio knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had everything.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had almost nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">They would never work.</p><p dir="ltr">If Rio spent all of her time convincing herself as much, she might actually believe it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, if it tastes as good as it smells, I will say thank you ahead of time,” Rio teased, stopping just shy of standing directly in front of Agatha. She couldn’t get too close. It would be too much, cause her to do something stupid. So space was kept, enough to compel her to keep her hands to herself. “You don’t have to be this nice to me, you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s lips hitched in a smirk and she rolled her eyes, turning to pick the plates up before <em>very intentionally</em> brushing by Rio on her way to the dining room.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know that,” she called over her shoulder, waiting for Rio to follow. She caught the hint, taking her place across from Agatha at the small, circular table. The moment they were both seated, Agatha was very deliberate in the eye contact she immediately established. “I don’t <em>have</em> to do anything. But we’re friends. And… If you’re good to your friends, they tend to stick around.”</p><p dir="ltr">The way she said it struck something in Rio, though she did not dwell on it too long. It was just that they were sage words of wisdom, but it also sounded like they came from experience.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t worth prying, not as they were enjoying their dinner.</p><p dir="ltr">Which… If Rio was being honest, was actually pretty fucking delicious.</p><p dir="ltr">Was there anything Agatha <em>couldn’t</em> do?</p><p dir="ltr">Considering she was kind enough to make them a meal, Rio tended to cleaning up and stowing the dishes in the dishwasher. Somewhere in the process, a pair of hands wound up on her hips and a nose graced the crook of her neck. Agatha was warm, perhaps from the wine they had with their dinner, but her touch was strong and demanding.</p><p dir="ltr">So when she kicked the door of the dishwasher shut and threw Rio up on the counter?</p><p dir="ltr">Who was Rio to argue?</p><p dir="ltr">After a little romp around the kitchen, they cleaned up and redressed, finding themselves a little too close on the couch while Agatha threw on some documentary on D.B. Cooper.</p><p dir="ltr">“That was me in a past life, you know?” she tossed out, drowning any follow-up with a glass of wine.</p><p dir="ltr">All Rio could do was laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“Was it, now?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It was. And no, I will not elaborate further.”</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t need to. Rio could see it. Even if it wasn’t true, even if past lives weren’t real, it fit and that was all that seemed to matter.</p><p dir="ltr">A little over an hour into the documentary, Rio’s eyes grew heavy, a yawn slipping from her intermittently. It wasn’t that she’d had a long or hard day or anything of the sort. Instead, it was a sense of… peace?</p><p dir="ltr">That was fucking weird.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was comfortable.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was comfortable.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio did not second guess the way she scooted the tiniest bit closer until they were pressed together and her head lulled back to the couch, eyes finally sliding all the way shut.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Only one minute</em>, she told herself, but it was a lie.</p><p dir="ltr">She realized how big of a lie it was when she woke up to a strange feeling near the top of her head. It was the lightest digging, but not really digging. It was scratching? Her eyes fluttered open and she realized that somehow, in her sleep, she was practically folded into Agatha’s side and in an attempt to wake her up, Agatha was gently raking her fingers through Rio’s hair.</p><p dir="ltr">“Rise and shine,” she murmured, causing a deep crease to form on Rio’s forehead.</p><p dir="ltr">“How long have I been asleep?” came her grumbled and slightly confused question.</p><p dir="ltr">“About an hour. Let’s get in bed.” Agatha was being soft spoken for probably the first time since Rio met her; her voice was a low, hushed murmur and the look in her eyes was… <em>gentle. Soft. Careful.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Okay,” Rio agreed. But she closed her eyes again.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey,” a soft prodding came, both in the word and the feeling of Agatha’s fingers into her side. “You can do that upstairs. Come on.”</p><p dir="ltr">Truthfully, Rio was not entirely awake. She listened – mostly because Agatha took her by the hand and led her up the stairs – but not everything was crystal clear. In fact, the moment she crawled into the other side of the bed and let her head drop to the pillow, she was back asleep in an instant.</p><p dir="ltr">The next morning brought a new, strange sensation.</p><p dir="ltr">As Rio’s consciousness slowly returned to her form, something struck her. Her legs felt weird. Not bad weird. Just… different. Weighted. Trapped?</p><p dir="ltr">When her eyes fluttered open, it was to the sight of Agatha only half a foot away.</p><p dir="ltr">And their legs were tangled.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Something else was different, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was not sleeping naked. Maybe it had to do with the fact they hadn’t fucked right before bed, but even then, for a woman who wore nothing more than a robe and <em>maybe</em> a pair of underwear 90% of the time she was home, it felt… strange. Even in her old t-shirt and boxers, Agatha was still a wonder of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Even with their legs tangled together in a way that made Rio feel as though some intimacy boundary had been breached in their sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t her fault. And it wasn’t really Agatha’s fault. It just happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Kinda like them.</p><p dir="ltr">They just happened.</p><p dir="ltr">And now what the fuck was there to do about it?</p><p dir="ltr">Nothing, Rio realized, until she had some time alone to truly think it all through.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe forty minutes later, Agatha rolled away the smallest amount, freeing Rio’s legs from their hold in the process. But Rio didn’t move. She did not get up or leave. She simply laid there a little while longer, her dark eyes shimmering in the morning light as she just watched the woman next to her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha Harkness.</p><p dir="ltr">What a confusing, confounding, perplexing, complicated woman.</p><p dir="ltr">What an amazing one, too.</p><p dir="ltr">With another ten minutes melted away, Rio finally pried herself out of bed and made her way downstairs, doing her best to treat Agatha’s kitchen as if it were her own, starting with making a pot of coffee. Before it was even finished, she heard footsteps on the stairs and grinned at the sight of Agatha in a new robe.</p><p dir="ltr">“Was the t-shirt too stifling?” Rio teased as she leaned against the counter, her eyes fixed to Agatha as she sleepily floated into the kitchen, wasting no time in pulling down a couple of mugs for them.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes,” Agatha admitted through a yawn, “but given you immediately went back to sleep, I didn’t want to sleep naked without your permission.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was silly; they were in <em>Agatha’s</em> house, a place she could do whatever she wanted <em>whenever</em> she wanted and yet…</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re very respectful,” came another goading, a wide smile on Rio’s lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged. “Yeah, well… I like having you around I guess.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You guess?” she shot back through a laugh. “You know what? I’ll take it. Better than ‘Get the fuck out of my house, Vidal!’ right?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t tempt me…” she mused, reaching forward to grab the handle of the coffee pot. It was a grumble, but the small sliver of a smile she was wearing kept Rio from getting worried.</p><p dir="ltr">“I prefer to tempt you in other ways. Like, you know, with our little project later. I think it’s time we put on a <em>real</em> show.” Teeth and sparkles rang with mischievousness as Rio reached for the mug Agatha nudged toward her and took a sip of the black coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh?” Agatha returned, her eyebrow cocked. “And how do you think we should do that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Remember the one you bought with the purple and white swirl? I think it was eight inches?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s eyes went wide, pupils practically blowing at the mere mention.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re serious? Second video?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio grinned again, nodding her head before she took another sip of the piping hot liquid.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit.”</p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit was right.</p><p dir="ltr">The second video took them notably longer to film than the first, mostly for two reasons.</p><ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was <em>adamant</em> about making sure every angle was perfect.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>And</em> they went at it a little longer, having forgotten the cameras completely.</p>
</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">Oh, how Rio couldn’t <em>wait</em> to see <em>that</em> final product.</p><p dir="ltr">As she kissed her way up Agatha’s body, more tender than needy, Rio wasn’t expecting the way Agatha’s hands hooked under her arms and pulled her up her chest, not letting her shirk off to the side entirely. She slid a <em>little</em>, but Agatha kept her held tight to the framing of her body.</p><p dir="ltr">“I should shower and go home,” Rio murmured into her skin, stupidly kissing at her shoulder out of nothing more than mindless instinct.</p><p dir="ltr">“Just stay,” Agatha returned, running the tips of her fingers up Rio’s back.</p><p dir="ltr">“But I have class in the morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha shifted enough to fully extend her arm, swiping up her phone off of the nightstand. She tapped the screen a couple of times and, as if on cue, Rio’s phone buzzed from the opposite stand.</p><p dir="ltr">“There’s twenty for a ride home and fifteen for one to campus. Now you don’t have an excuse.”</p><p dir="ltr">She was right.</p><p dir="ltr">Having class and needing to get there on time was the <em>only</em> excuse Rio could come up with as to why she shouldn’t stay.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, that was a lie. There were plenty of other excuses she <em>could</em> have tried, but they would have shown her cards too much.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll stay,” she resigned, “but I <em>should</em> still shower.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that an invitation?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Only if you want it to be.”</p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">Monday morning was a break from routine.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio woke up to the sound of her (early) alarm, she was not in her bed or even in her house. She was still at Agatha’s on a morning they would have otherwise <em>never</em> spent together. Then again, it was a cap to a weekend that probably never should have happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t want to leave.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t want to get up and get dressed and climb in the back of a car and wind up at home to gather her things for the day. She wanted to roll over and curl into the woman on the other side of the bed and forget that responsibilities were afoot.</p><p dir="ltr">The weekend was a getaway, an escape, and she was not entirely sure she should let it happen again.</p><p dir="ltr">By Tuesday evening when she cracked her books open to do her homework, she decided she wouldn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">Let it happen again, that was.</p><p dir="ltr">Spending time with Agatha was okay (it was more than okay, it was <em>fantastic and incredible,</em> but she had to lie to herself for her plan to work), but only in moderation. She had to consider that while yes, she was more than getting something out of their arrangement, maybe what she was getting was more than she thought she’d ever have.</p><p dir="ltr">Fucking feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn’t what she signed up for.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet her dumb ass let it happen anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was <em>remarkable</em>, she was special in ways Rio hardly knew how to explain, and of course it was natural to be attracted to that. Maybe she still had not wormed her way past Agatha’s thick shell, but she felt as though she’d made more progress than anyone before her ever had.</p><p dir="ltr">But only because Agatha let her.</p><p dir="ltr">She was halfway through a paper on formulaic expression of ASCII coding in plants when her phone dinged from the table, next to her book.</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Agatha Harkness 😈<br/></b><em>1 video</em></p><p dir="ltr">What was she up to? Rio raised a brow and scooped up her phone, ready to open Agatha’s mischief, but before she could even unlock the screen, it began to ring.</p><p dir="ltr"><b>Agatha Harkness 😈<br/></b><em>Incoming call</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio actually laughed aloud, shaking her head as she answered the call.</p><p dir="ltr">“You know, if you wanted me to watch whatever that is, calling me before I can even open it delays that process,” she greeted instead of a simple ‘hello.’</p><p dir="ltr">“And if I did <em>not </em>want you to watch it until I grabbed you first?” came Agatha’s whippy retort over the line.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned into the couch as she considered, a small smirk on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why might that be?” she pressed, tilting her head back as she closed her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because I don’t think you should open it until any prior obligations are fulfilled.”</p><p dir="ltr">Immediately, Rio sat up and her eyes flew open as realization hit her; she suddenly was all too aware of what was on that video and the thought of waiting to see it started to burn through her skull, just like how the video was going to burn a hole in her phone if she did not watch it right that instant.</p><p dir="ltr">“Friday night?” Rio asked, damn near breathless.</p><p dir="ltr">“Edited and finished! Will post it when I have your approval!”</p><p dir="ltr">Approval.</p><p dir="ltr">She needed to watch the video. That was a given, but knowing it was something she had to sign off on instead of jack off to made her head spin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, okay, yes. I need to finish this last bit of homework, and then I’ll definitely send you my review.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed, loud and full over the line.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, please. Include a grade as well. And you can’t just give yourself full marks for vanity’s sake, even if <em>I</em> would give you full marks cause you’re hot.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a genuine – if not backhanded – compliment and yet, Rio’s ears still grew hot and red and she could physically <em>feel</em> a warm blush present on her neck and cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus Christ.</p><p dir="ltr">What was she, a fucking high schooler?</p><p dir="ltr">Get a damn grip, woman.</p><p dir="ltr">“And if I give you full marks because <em>you’re </em>hot?” Rio teased, even though she wasn’t exactly lying.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’d expect nothing less,” Agatha replied, a touch of arrogance in her tone.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, soft and sweet.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll let you know after homework and a shower, how about that?” she offered.</p><p dir="ltr">“Erm. Maybe video first, shower after.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh.</p><p dir="ltr">What the fuck was she in for?</p><p dir="ltr">“I had to use two different vibrators during editing but only because the first one died.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh good lord.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was a voracious being, but such an admittance made Rio’s cunt throb and twitch with anticipation.</p><p dir="ltr">“Noted.” Rio paused for a moment, a subconscious tongue swiping across her lips as images of Agatha in her mask getting eaten out flashed through her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">If it was hot to be between her legs, feeling her and tasting her and reveling in her pleasure, Rio couldn’t even begin to imagine what it was like to see it from different angles.</p><p dir="ltr">“I posted a couple of more photos from the shoot we did,” Agatha informed her before tossing something crunchy into her mouth. “And also a notice that the subscriptions will go up to $14.99 a month but that more content would be coming. And I figured we’d price the videos at $9.99 for now until we gauge the interaction on those.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, what a stark reminder that this was just business and nothing else.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of…</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m afraid to ask about the current standings…” Rio said, her voice a little nervous.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well…” Agatha began with a soft snort. “Forty-nine people have paid to see the photoshoot behind the scenes. If that’s any indication.”</p><p dir="ltr">Holy <em>fuck.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>WHAT?!</em></p><p dir="ltr">That was almost <em>five hundred dollars.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>In a fucking week.</em></p><p dir="ltr">That was almost as much as Rio made picking up a fuck ton of odd jobs in <em>an entire month</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was just business, but it was apparently business where Agatha knew how to do little more than excel.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re joking,” Rio cut, her voice a little hard only because she was bracing herself for Agatha to admit she was.</p><p dir="ltr">“Do you think we’re so repulsive I would be lying?” Oh, she was being coy now.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course not, it’s just that…” Rio sighed as she lowered the phone for a moment and slumped into the couch again.</p><p dir="ltr">She should be honest, even if it encroached on the line of oversharing.</p><p dir="ltr">“Good things like this don’t usually happen for people like me.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a silence over the line, one that felt heavy with the admission, but Agatha was quick as she found her response.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m not a ‘usually’ kinda gal,” she returned, crunching on something else. When she finished chewing, she spoke again. “Good things either happen or they don’t. And it’s happening for you. So let it.”</p><p dir="ltr">She was right. Fighting it was pointless; this was all to help her anyway and even if there was a split, she was two hundred and fifty dollars closer to her goal than she was before.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re right, I guess.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Always am.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I should get back to homework. But… We’re still on for tomorrow?” Rio tried not to be, but she was a little nervous with the sudden idea that Agatha might change their plans.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course. We meet up on Wednesdays unless I’m dead or in the hospital.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, shaking her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“Have a good night, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You too, my doe.”</p><p dir="ltr">Hot lava.</p><p dir="ltr">It was poured over her head and was quick to race down her body.</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight, you idiot.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, thank god.</p><p dir="ltr">As she hung up the phone, a pathetic whimper slipped through Rio’s lips before turning into a soft sigh.</p><p dir="ltr">With a gentle sense of appreciation, a thought struck her and she acted on it.</p><p dir="ltr">She brought up Agatha’s contact and hit the backspace, deleting that little devil emoji and her entire name. She thought for a moment on whether or not she should commit to the renaming, but did anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha got to call her ‘her doe’ (which, Jesus Fucking Christ), then Rio could rename her in her phone.</p><p dir="ltr">All she typed was a single emoji.</p><p dir="ltr">“🦊”</p><p dir="ltr">Her fox.</p><p dir="ltr">Only she knew for appearance’s sake, throwing the ‘my’ into a contact name was probably overstepping. Then again, reacting so fucking viscerally to Agatha using that pet name for her was probably a breach of social contract, too, but she couldn’t bring herself to care.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew the truth:</p><p dir="ltr">She’d caught feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">Another truth?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha would <em>never</em> feel the same.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay. If she were being brutally honest with herself, Rio knew that was actually a lie. But she couldn’t risk it, couldn’t take a chance on it because if something happened and they fell apart before she hit her goal, she wasn’t sure what she would do.</p><p dir="ltr">Watching the video and sending a general summary of approval made her even more unsure. It was hot and she came twice throughout the twelve minutes, but <em>fuck.</em></p><p dir="ltr">She needed Agatha, far more than just the physical sense. She needed the support, the kindness, the offerings of hope. It was stupid and she knew telling Agatha as much was absolutely <em>not</em> an option, but admitting it to herself was the first step… Right?</p><p dir="ltr">It just meant she could focus on honing it in a little more, on not allowing herself to succumb to Agatha’s sweet sentiments or gentle declarations. Yes, they were hot. Yes, she liked it when Agatha told her as much, but she couldn’t let herself get carried away. They still had a job to do and while a mere behind-the-scenes video of them still mostly clothed already raked in $500, there was still so much more to be done.</p><p dir="ltr">At least Wednesdays, thankfully, were a break from that.</p><p dir="ltr">It seemed they’d developed a routine; Wednesdays were for fun, the kind of sex they got to have without the cameras on and with every bit of clothing off. It was a chance to just indulge and not worry who might see what. All that mattered to Rio was Agatha seeing every bit of her and her getting to see every bit of Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a release in more than one way, but Rio knew one thing for certain.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t stay.</p><p dir="ltr">While she was openly admitting to herself that she was treading into the dangerous depths of having feelings, she was not ready to indulge herself with as much of Agatha’s time as she could get.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t fucking needy.</p><p dir="ltr">She was just stupid.</p><p dir="ltr">So, when Agatha asked that night for her to stay, she made an excuse.</p><p dir="ltr">“I have to go in early for a lab. But I promise I’ll come back on Saturday first thing.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha pouted, her lip sticking out.</p><p dir="ltr">“Not Friday?” she asked, clearly displeased.</p><p dir="ltr">It took Rio two seconds to buckle.</p><p dir="ltr">“If you want me to come back Friday, I will come back Friday,” Rio submitted, her eyes lifting to Agatha’s after she pulled her shirt over her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“And you’ll pack a bag again?”</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">How was she supposed to say no to that?</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t <em>want</em> to say no to that.</p><p dir="ltr">So, like the fucking idiot she was, Rio agreed.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, you win,” she agreed, moving to sit on the edge of the bed after pulling on her sweatpants. “I will come over Friday after class and I will bring a bag of clothes and other necessities.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Other necessities?” Agatha took a drag of her cigarette, raising an eyebrow in curiosity at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">“Skin care, toothpaste ‘cause yours is gross, my Thunderstick.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Shut up,” Agatha exclaimed, bolting forward with her eyes wide. “You have a fucking Thunderstick and you never thought to mention it until now?” Those blue irises sparkled deviously and a smirk curled up the corner of her mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, you’re already making plans, aren’t you?” Rio asked, unable to fight a smirk of her own.</p><p dir="ltr">“Of course I am. I wonder how many times I can get you to come before you literally beg me to stop. Plus, that <em>while</em> I’m inside you? Oh, you’ll be a fucking mess.”</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha didn’t quit talking like that, Rio was going to fucking strip down again and she’d probably end up missing class the next day.</p><p dir="ltr">No.</p><p dir="ltr">Bad.</p><p dir="ltr">Bad Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">“Already throbbing just thinking about it,” Rio offered with a wink. “See you Friday?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned forward, reaching up to cup her cheek as she pressed a soft kiss – a kiss of goodbye – to her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Aw, fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">That was so not good it was almost painful.</p><p dir="ltr">Even more painful was the way Rio’s stomach suddenly felt like a cage filled with butterflies and her heart was about to beat its way out of her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">So fucking not good.</p><p dir="ltr">“See you Friday. Text me when you get home safely.”</p><p dir="ltr">She did, but she did so with a grunt as she flung herself onto her bed, knowing far too well she was in way over her head.</p><p dir="ltr">But she couldn’t stop. That much she knew with absolute certainty. She needed this and whether she liked it or not, she needed Agatha to see this out with her.</p><p dir="ltr">Class on Thursday was excruciatingly long, but Rio made it through. There was enough work to keep her busy from the moment she got home, but when a message notification dinged from her phone around 7 pm, she already knew who it was.</p><p dir="ltr">🦊<br/><em>1 video</em></p><p dir="ltr">Not one second later…</p><p dir="ltr">🦊<br/><em>Incoming Call</em></p><p dir="ltr">Oh god.</p><p dir="ltr">Not again.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi, Agatha,” Rio greeted in a sing-song tone of voice. “Another video for me to grade?”</p><p dir="ltr">“How did you know?” Agatha gasped back, feigning hurt. “Am I that predictable?!”</p><p dir="ltr">“If I say yes, are you going to be mad at me?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Depends on how you want to be fucked tomorrow night,” Agatha whipped in return, feeling like a damn kick right between Rio’s legs.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then… In that case, yes. Agatha, you are the most predictable person I’ve ever met in my entire life.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Ohhhh,” she growled, playing right into it with a lightness still laced in her tone. “You’re in for it now.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I was hoping you’d say that.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Alright, well. Have a good night!” Agatha offered as she made it sound like she was pulling the phone away from her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">“HEY! WAIT!” Rio yowled, feeling rather indignant about the sudden dismissal.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes?” Agatha cooed sweetly, voice like honey.</p><p dir="ltr">“What the hell was that?” she snapped, far too insolent to admit that she was maybe a little upset about the idea that Agatha could just hang up on her.</p><p dir="ltr">“I figured you have more school work to tend to, and a video to watch. So I thought I’d just let you go about your evening.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, she was playing it so fucking cool, but Rio felt like she was burning up all of a sudden despite it being a chill 68 degrees in her apartment.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re an asshole sometimes,” Rio grumbled with a sigh.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s one of the things you like most about me.”</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">“I really should get back to studying. I promise I will make sure my vibrators are charged and send you a full review before I go to bed. Sound good?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed on the other side of the line and Rio could practically see her nodding her head in her mind’s eye.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sounds perfect. Have a good night, Rio. See you tomorrow.”</p><p dir="ltr">“See you tomorrow, my fox.”</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t give Agatha even a second to react, hanging up the moment she realized what was actively leaving her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">God.</p><p dir="ltr">Such a fucking idiot.</p><p dir="ltr">Until her phone dinged in her hand again.</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight, my doe.”</p><p dir="ltr">If there was ever an award for being the most cooked in the history of the entire universe, it surely would have went to Rio Mother Fucking Vidal.</p><p dir="ltr">That was for damn sure.</p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">After finishing a round of homework she’d been extensively putting off until the very last possible minute, Rio closed her textbook and pushed it to the other side of her coffee table with a loud sigh. It was more for release than it was for drama, but it <em>did </em>sound pretty dramatic to even herself.</p><p dir="ltr">She was creeping up on fucking <em>forty</em> and she felt like she could crack from the pressure.</p><p dir="ltr">And they expected fresh-faced-just-a-child-a-year-ago, newly minted adults to do this shit?</p><p dir="ltr">No wonder the drop put rate kept going up.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone always spoke as though it were <em>sooo</em> easy to go back to an institution meant for the young after too long spent waiting, but this shit wasn’t easy at all.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fucking hard.</p><p dir="ltr">Some days, it felt pointless.</p><p dir="ltr">But then, Rio would look at the family photo of the four Vidals before Mateo’s accident and remember.</p><p dir="ltr">She did it for them.</p><p dir="ltr">She did it for the brother who spent far too long without any agency because her parents couldn’t let him go.</p><p dir="ltr">She did it for the father who lost his life to the cruel hand of the universe.</p><p dir="ltr">She did it for the mother who died of little more than grief and loneliness.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio pushed through every late night studying and every early morning class because of them. Because they loved her and would have been elated to see her accomplish greatness in their lifetimes.</p><p dir="ltr">But there was no one to bear witness, now.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, that wasn’t entirely true.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was there.</p><p dir="ltr">And, actually, more than witnessing greatness, she was fucking inspiring it. She could have let Rio go on about her life after the night they formally met at the bar and fucked completely raw, but she hadn’t. Hell, she could have treated Rio like nothing more than a booty call and Rio would have gone along with it.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn’t Agatha’s style.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha wasn’t a passive player in life; she took action and did things because she chose to. She made waves, made noise, and in Rio’s case, she made a fucking difference.</p><p dir="ltr">It dawned on her that it might have been a good idea to ask what the total standings were in relation to the account, given she’d posted the first video the day before.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wasn’t sure if the reality would terrify her or excite her.</p><p dir="ltr">It would admittedly be pretty crushing to find out it wasn’t doing as well as the photoshoot video, but on the other hand, would likely be just as jarring if it blew up.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was better to just not know.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was better to be distracted.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe.</p><p dir="ltr">In an attempt to do just that, Rio tidied up her living room and gathered her things before winding down the hallway to her room. She considered jumping in the shower, but she knew had one last assignment for the day.</p><p dir="ltr">Video number two.</p><p dir="ltr">It was their first penetrative video and honestly, Rio <em>still </em>felt sore from such a rigorous multi-hour workout even if she’d lie if asked. While sex with Agatha was always fun, <em>that</em> particular night took the cake.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, they'd gone at it for <em>hours</em>, to a point where Rio was actually baffled to think it might be whittled down to a ten minute video.</p><p dir="ltr">When she opened it and the still frame was her on her knees, clad in the waist harness with her thong on, and her ass and pussy clearly on display, she realized how Agatha did it.</p><p dir="ltr">She only included round one.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh god.</p><p dir="ltr">Immediately, flashes of the night played through Rio’s mind, causing a noticeable thumping to start up between her legs. And it was <em>her. </em>It was a fucking porno where <em>her ass and pussy </em>were proudly displayed for the world to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe before this all started, the idea would have been a terrifying one, but…</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at it on her phone, only one thing crossed her mind:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Damn, I look good from that angle.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The darkness of her bush was in full contrast to the pink of her inner lips, just big enough to be seen, and it was apparent she was needy and ready.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha made damn fucking sure of that before the masks and cameras were even on.</p><p dir="ltr">When she hit play, her body reacted in kind, throbbing a little harder.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh!</p><p dir="ltr">Shit!</p><p dir="ltr">Wait!</p><p dir="ltr">Tapping the screen to pause it, Rio practically threw herself to the edge of the bed and rummaged through her drawer, grabbing one of her favorites (a 3-in-one with clitoral suction, g-spot stimulation, and a thrusting function) before flopping to her back again.</p><p dir="ltr">Would sure beat the hell out of shoving her hand in her pants.</p><p dir="ltr">Actually –</p><p dir="ltr">She was home alone. Why the fuck was she still dressed?</p><p dir="ltr">Like a writing eel on dry land, Rio managed to kick and pull her way out of her sweats and t-shirt, leaving her flat and completely bare, just the way it should be.</p><p dir="ltr">With a little finesse and help from the pooled slick of cum between her pegs, Rio pressed her little helper past her entrance, as far as she could get it, and turned it on.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha could not physically fuck her right that minute, but watching her do it with that inside of her body was going to be the next best thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Already quivering from mere thoughts of their night spent together, Rio hit play.</p><p dir="ltr">It was strange, watching herself and at the same time, watching a version of herself where she could not see her face. She knew it was her, had those clear memories, and yet… It felt like it wasn’t her, or Agatha, or their typical night spent together.</p><p dir="ltr">The first shot was an overhead, the mount extended and angled to capture perfectly as Agatha stepped up behind her and gripped at a bottle of opaque lube, using it to coat the eight inches of purple and white swirled silicone between her legs.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio already knew how <em>that</em> ended; she wondered if Agatha would have been brave enough to include it.</p><p dir="ltr">Only eleven minutes or so to find out.</p><p dir="ltr">Once properly slick, Agatha took her sweet time in running the head of the cock between her folds, purposely applying pressure to Rio’s clit in the most delicious way. It made present-day Rio press the dildo a little further into her body, garnering a little more suction.</p><p dir="ltr">She was going to bust before the two minute mark.</p><p dir="ltr">She barely made it to the one minute mark.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha pressed into her, Rio’s body reacted harshly and instantly, her orgasm slamming right into her before she even knew it was coming.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t stop, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck no.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe, if she could hunker down on her resolve a little more, she could come as many times as she did that night, being at Agatha’s mercy.</p><p dir="ltr">She was fixed on the video, the overhead angle showing every beautiful inch of Agatha’s cock sliding into her body, mere inches at first before delving deeper with each slow rock of her hips.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fucking hot.</p><p dir="ltr">Even knowing it was her, knowing she’d already live the experience, it was still so fucking attractive. Her head on screen dropped, mask bumping slightly against the mattress as her hips shifted into the feeling, wanting more.</p><p dir="ltr">For eight minutes that were both infinite and not long enough, Rio watched as Agatha completely filled and stuffed her, wrecking her in the most deliriously delightful way. She could see her own desperation, how she clawed and gripped at the sheets while she made all those fucking sounds.</p><p dir="ltr">Between Agatha’s breathing and her occasional grunt when she would grip at the leather and fuck harder, Rio came again another two times in those eight minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">She was still stuck, completely focused on the video as her sounds of orgasm on screen and in person nearly echoed each other. Finally reaching the point of over-stimulation, Rio removed the dildo and turned it off, dropping it to the side as her chest heaved and her breathing slowly began to even out.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, the one thing she’d been wondering about was right in front of her face.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha pulled out and gave her hip a light tap, a silent instruction to roll over and lay on her back. She did so in the video, clearly winded and spent, but her legs fell open with ease, giving Agatha plenty of time to pick up the third camera, getting close enough to bring Rio’s soaking wet cunt right into view.</p><p dir="ltr">There, on screen, was Rio’s pussy on full display with a dribbling of the gathered lube, opaque for a reason.</p><p dir="ltr">It looked like Agatha fucking came in her.</p><p dir="ltr">God, if her nerve endings weren’t absolutely on fire, she would have shoved that damn dildo right back in again.</p><p dir="ltr">That was fucking <em>hot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Even hotter was the way the scene cut and immediately, Agatha’s mask was off, her face was blurred, and she was cleaning up the mess she left behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh shit.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could have sworn she <em>almost</em> came again at the mere sight.</p><p dir="ltr">It wore on only a little while longer before a spliced montage played at the end and closed out with their account name over a black screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Fucking hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew one thing for certain as she locked her phone and dropped it on the bed, still feeling like she’d run a marathon:</p><p dir="ltr"><em>She</em> would have paid a decent chunk of money for that and not at all been disappointed.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe Agatha had always known, maybe it was why she pushed so hard. Whatever the case, Rio knew that if they could keep this up and not absolutely run it into the ground, they might stand a chance at making the money she would need to pay off her final year.</p><p dir="ltr">They could do it.</p><p dir="ltr">They would do it.</p><p dir="ltr">But only if she kept her feelings in check.</p><p dir="ltr">That failed spectacularly the moment she grabbed for her phone and brought it up, finding the first contact.</p><p dir="ltr">🦊</p><p dir="ltr">The call rang out and she squirmed slightly in bed, her free hand dropping to lazily glide through the cum soaking her folds as she waited for Agatha to answer. It was a lazy motion, back and forth with special attention to not graze her clit. If she even considered it, she was going to fall apart in an undignified kind of way.</p><p dir="ltr">It rang once, then twice. It rang a third time and then a fourth, rolling onto a fifth until it kicked her over to voicemail.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>What?</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fucking voicemail?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Where the fuck could Agatha possibly be at eleven thirty on a Thursday night? Why wouldn’t she take the time to answer Rio’s call when she’d very obviously given her something she needed feedback on. Maybe she was expecting some lengthy text with descriptive edits or ways to make it better, but Rio didn’t think it needed to be better.</p><p dir="ltr"><br/>
It was perfect.</p><p dir="ltr">Them, there, in those damn masks and little else, they were so fucking perfect.</p><p dir="ltr">What she wanted was for Agatha to pick up the phone so she could tell her she was grabbing a car and would be over in twenty. But… Given that Agatha wasn’t answering, it threw a bit of a wrench into her plans.</p><p dir="ltr">All she wanted was Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">More than just on camera, Rio wanted her. She wanted the late nights, the sweet taste of her skin, the sex, the necessity. She wanted the early mornings, the showers, the coffee and muffins.</p><p dir="ltr">Just Agatha. In any and all of those things.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the <em>only</em> thing Rio <em>actually</em> wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, of course, she wanted to graduate and get a job in her field and make a name for whatever was left of her life she could, but those were all mandated by her desire to succeed.</p><p dir="ltr">The way she wanted Agatha was different.</p><p dir="ltr">That kind of want was mandated by connection and emotion. It was stupid and Rio knew it, but she was also aware she had to quit lying to herself if she ever hoped to stifle her feelings long enough to see it all out.</p><p dir="ltr">Seeing it all out…</p><p dir="ltr">What did that even mean?</p><p dir="ltr">When they hit their goal, were they just going to part ways and never speak to one another again? Was that typical for the kind of arrangement they had? Was it typical to just make porn with someone and go back to being strangers again?</p><p dir="ltr">Very rapidly, Rio’s post-orgasm haze started to twist and warp into something else, something close to anxiety. She was spinning the yarn too far ahead of herself and as a result, she was beginning to panic.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she could get <em>too</em> far, her phone rang.</p><p dir="ltr">🦊</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Incoming Call</em></p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Perfect timing.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey,” Rio greeted, suddenly forcing the video to the forefront of her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, sorry. I was in the shower. Didn’t mean to miss your call.”</p><p dir="ltr">The way Agatha sounded actually apologetic, it melted Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s okay, I just… I watched your little assignment… <em>Our</em> little assignment. And…”</p><p dir="ltr">“And?” Agatha pushed, clearly searching for a review.</p><p dir="ltr">What she got was something else entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m coming over.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a shocked silence over the line as Agatha struggled to compute what day of the week it was and what Rio was actually implying.</p><p dir="ltr">“You have class in the morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">Yep. She caught on right quick, didn’t she?</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio didn’t care.</p><p dir="ltr">She just needed to see Agatha, to be with her, even if only for a few hours.</p><p dir="ltr">“For just this one day…” Rio began, biting her lip. “Fuck class.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">It took Rio all of five minutes to email her professors, claiming that she was sick and would not be in the following day.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was stupid. Maybe she needed to focus on being a decent academic instead of getting her rocks off, but for someone who had otherwise perfect attendance, Rio felt she deserved a day off. She deserved a day where she didn’t have to think about school or homework or trying to pay attention when all she wanted to do was think about Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">God. What a fucking mess.</p><p dir="ltr">Her whole damn mantra from the very fucking beginning was ‘do not catch feelings.’ So what the fuck was she doing? It was beyond just finding any spare minute to soak up with Agatha and was bordering on something a little more dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">How could she stop?</p><p dir="ltr">If she tried to save them both in terms of handling her feelings, she knew the only real option was to walk away, but she couldn’t. They were business partners, working together to accomplish a greater goal in the form of Rio’s education. It was so fucking important to her and yet, she was daring to skip class for a little self indulgence.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a one time thing. It had to be a one time thing. She was not always going to be so weak-willed that she could cave every time, but this time…</p><p dir="ltr">This time, all she could think about was that damn video, the way Agatha handled her in it, and how it actually felt to live out the experience. It was one thing to be a participant, but it was something else entirely to watch yourself be a participant. It was a strange disassociation and was still a turn-on all the same.</p><p dir="ltr">If Rio were being completely honest with herself, she knew the moment Agatha put her hands on her, she was likely to come immediately. It wasn’t in any way because she was weak or easy, but she’d already worked herself over to the point of sensitivity; when the woman she fawned over and – begrudgingly – cared about touched her, it would be over in an instant.</p><p dir="ltr">So she wanted to get to Agatha first.</p><p dir="ltr">After shoving a few days worth of clothes into her duffel bag and finding a ride, Rio quickly (or as quickly as she could manage with a driver who liked doing five under the limit) made her way over to Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">When she arrived, something was different.</p><p dir="ltr">The lights in the house were on, shining brightly into the dark night, but the porch light was on, too. Even more than that, in one of the wooden rocking chairs that looked like they came from fucking Cracker Barrel or something, Agatha sat with a cigarette pinched between her fingers.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, I get a welcoming committee this evening?” Rio called from the sidewalk, slinging her bag over her shoulder as the rideshare drove off.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s nice out,” Agatha returned, her voice just loud enough for Rio to catch it as she made her way up the front steps. Agatha held up the pack of cigarettes, as if on offer. “Want one?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wasn’t a smoker, but admittedly she did like the flavor of cigarettes Agatha smoked.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sure,” she agreed, slipping one out of the pack. She set her bag down and took a seat in the other chair, reaching for the lighter on the table between them. As she lit it, she glanced at the woman beside her and smiled. “I think you’re just torturing me,” she stated in an exhale.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh? How so?” came a coy response.</p><p dir="ltr">She fucking knew what she was doing.</p><p dir="ltr">“You know I called out of class because of that damn video and you purposefully sat out here to make me wait a little longer.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s lips curled into a smirk as she stared out across the street at the wide, open patch of grass. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Uhuh. Fuckin’ liarrrrr.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio sighed and took a drag of her cigarette, savoring the flavor before she exhaled. “You are oh so cruel sometimes, you know that?”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha chuckled, blowing out a puff of smoke. “It’s a life goal of mine. To be cruel, I mean.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was utter bullshit if Rio had ever heard it. Maybe Agatha was many things (guarded, collected, composed) but cruel was not one of them and they both knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">“To be a brat, maybe,” Rio retorted. She reached over to the ashtray between them and stubbed the cigarette out and leaned into the chair, rocking slightly without a sound.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s more fun for both of us that way.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio snorted.</p><p dir="ltr">“You <em>do</em> know that unless you bolt off the moment you walk inside, that robe will be off before the door even finishes shutting, right?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I was counting on it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Good thing because it was exactly what happened the moment they crossed into the house and Rio applied just enough force to cause the door to click shut the very second she tossed Agatha’s silk robe to the side with it catching on the coat hook near the closet door.</p><p dir="ltr">To distract herself from spiraling down the whole cavern of potential feelings, she simply focused on Agatha and only Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha and how soft her skin was.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha and how she tasted so salty and sweet.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha who took all Rio had to give and then some.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for Rio, as she kissed her way up Agatha’s body and rolled to her back, spent and winded from the wrestling match of Agatha’s thighs gripping at her head, she came to an annoying realization.</p><p dir="ltr">Her craving for Agatha was getting worse the more she got a taste.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck! No feelings, damnit!</p><p dir="ltr">She was distracted at least for a moment when Agatha spoke.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t know where you learned to eat pussy like that, but every single time, I am so fucking thankful.”</p><p dir="ltr">What a dumbass.</p><p dir="ltr">What a beautiful, ingenious, resourceful dumbass.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll be sure to send those two exes thank you cards on your behalf,” she teased, a hand slinging out lazily to light tap Agatha on the stomach.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ll give you a hundred to shove in each of them.”</p><p dir="ltr">She was so stupid. But she was funny and charming and had charisma for miles. It was no fucking wonder Rio couldn’t seem to stay away even if she knew it would be the best course of action in the long run.</p><p dir="ltr">The long run wasn’t something she had the ability to care about, not when the present was as demanding as it was.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m going to shower and make a snack. Would you like to join me?”</p><p dir="ltr">No!</p><p dir="ltr">Rio, say no!</p><p dir="ltr">But good <em>God</em>, she wanted to say yes.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, reason and rationale <em>finally</em> won out for once.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can shower after you. You don’t need to save on a water bill,” Rio offered, turning her head to throw a wink in Agatha’s direction.</p><p dir="ltr">For such a quick moment Rio almost missed it, Agatha deflated and then forced herself up, meandering off to the bathroom with a wave of her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“If you insist.”</p><p dir="ltr">No, actually, Rio did <em>not</em> insist. At least not in her mind. She stayed put on the bed, eyes following Agatha as she disappeared into the en suite and left the door cracked, surely an open ended invitation.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rio couldn’t take it.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t let herself get even closer than she already was.</p><p dir="ltr">She <em>was</em>, however, waiting in the bathroom as Agatha finished, a towel in hand and a ridiculous grin on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“You couldn’t join me but can be my towel girl?” Agatha questioned with a raised brow and a delighted smirk as she stepped out from the still-running water onto the plush bath mat at her feet.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, well, I like being helpful.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t I know it?”</p><p dir="ltr">They swapped places and while Rio took her time getting clean, she knew it was probably best to give themselves a breather if they were going to be spending the next three days together. Surely they would have to film some form of content in that time, so Rio tried to focus all of her energy and attention on that idea and that idea alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Until she came out of the bedroom to Agatha on the bed with a wooden tray covered in two plates of fruit and cheese and a small package of crackers on the side.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ohh, bedside charcuterie?” came Rio’s delighted question as she finished squeezing her hair out and hung the towel on the door handle, much to Agatha’s silent chagrin. She did not say anything about it and instead answered Rio’s question.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s the best I could do at three in the morning.” Her lips pushed upward in a smile that barely reached her eyes, though it was kind all the same.</p><p dir="ltr">“All efforts are appreciated.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Good to know.”</p><p dir="ltr">She said it like a simple fact, but there was a gleam in her eyes that should have told Rio she had something up her sleeve for their weekend together.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio ignored it on purpose.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha put on some random show as they ate, mostly to give them some form of noise so they were not sitting in silence. It wasn’t necessarily awkward, but Rio was trying to corral her thoughts into a tidy little pile and Agatha was…</p><p dir="ltr">Well, she was somewhere else. She wasn’t really looking at the television, but her movements were rather automated as she ate until they managed to clear both plates and she set the tray aside on the bedside table.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are you ready to sleep?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Since I know I don’t have to be up at the asscrack of dawn, I think so, yeah.”</p><p dir="ltr">With a soft smile, Agatha gave her knee a gentle pat and reached over to turn off the light, snuggling into the mattress only a few inches from Rio, who turned to lay on her side, facing Agatha. Her eyes closed instantly and she focused on slowing her breathing enough to get comfortable.</p><p dir="ltr">That was fucking hard when being so close to Agatha made her heart pound the way it did.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as she slipped into that in-between state of being awake and being asleep, something pulled her back into the night.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey Rio?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmmm?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m really glad you’re here.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Me too, Agatha. Sleep now.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Goodnight, my doe.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Sleep good, foxy.”</p><p dir="ltr">And just like that, she was out like a light.</p><p dir="ltr">When she woke up the next morning, she was alone and Agatha was nowhere to be found. Very faintly, Rio caught the scent of coffee in the air, but it almost smelled as if it was brewed a while before and the scent was fading.</p><p dir="ltr">What fucking time was it?</p><p dir="ltr">She groaned softly and rolled to her side, slapping a hand around for her phone on the side table. When she caught hold of it and brought it up, the time across the screen read 10:49 am.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t remember the last time she slept in until almost eleven. It was practically unheard of for her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha really did wear her out.</p><p dir="ltr">With a quiet grumble, she climbed out of bed and rifled through her things, pulling out her toothbrush with a quiet but triumphant ‘aha!’ After taking the time to brush her teeth and run a comb through her hair, Rio pulled on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts and made her way downstairs.</p><p dir="ltr">She was not at all surprised to find Agatha on the couch, robed with her feet propped on the coffee table, and her laptop opened in her laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s aliiiiive!” she crowed from the couch, a grin on her face as Rio pinned her with a not-so-menacing glare.</p><p dir="ltr">“Good morning to you, too,” she shot back as she rolled her eyes and shuffled her way into the kitchen to pour herself the remaining bit of coffee. “And what might you be up to this morning?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, you know,” Agatha said with a shrug Rio could barely see over the back of the couch when she turned around to sip her coffee. Agatha only continued when she heard Rio approach. “Just stuff.”</p><p dir="ltr">Close enough to look over her shoulder, Rio immediately grinned at what was on the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Glow in the dark, huh? And is that seven inches?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes and yes,” Agatha agreed with a tight nod of her head. “And… I was thinking. There’s a store in the city where we can pick up fluorescent paints and blacklights.”</p><p dir="ltr">Holy mother fuck of all that was sacred.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha had a fucking idea, she <em>had a fucking idea.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The idea of a video shot where all that was visible of them was paint and the glowing strap Agatha surely wanted to fuck her with?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to drag her back upstairs and show her what a good idea she thought it was.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, when Agatha tipped her head to rest on the back of the couch with a beaming grin on her face, her eyebrows waggling, Rio simply grinned right back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that a yes?” she asked. The excitement in her voice was the loudest fucking thing about her question.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s a yes. Should I go get dressed then?”</p><p dir="ltr">“If you want to pick up the paint today, yes. The dildo won’t be here until Saturday. So we technically <em>could</em> do it on Sunday.” She was still tipped back, completely upside down to Rio’s point of view, but all Rio was thinking about was how fucking badly she wanted to kiss her.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Stop that right this instant!</em></p><p dir="ltr">Why was being a responsible and somewhat sane adult so fucking hard sometimes?</p><p dir="ltr">“I think it sounds like a great idea,” Rio agreed, annoyingly pressing a finger to Agatha’s forehead as she stuck her tongue out. “Why don’t we finish our coffee and get dressed?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I like the way you think.”</p><p dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">Shopping, out in the real world, with Agatha was… different.</p><p dir="ltr">For some reason, simply gliding alongside her as they picked out different colors and types of paint, Rio wasn’t thinking about her feelings or how deeply she’d metaphorically fucked herself. Not at all. No, all she was thinking about was how… easy it all felt.</p><p dir="ltr">It was <em>easy</em> to make choices with Agatha, even when Agatha tasked her with deciding where they would go for lunch. Her options were between clean eating and falafel, which Rio knew Agatha only provided because <em>she</em> wanted falafel. It worked.</p><p dir="ltr">After lunch and stopping to pick up a couple more bottles of wine, the two of them retreated back to Agatha’s for the night and simply settled in to decompress. There was no pressure, no need to immediately dive right back into a fuck fest and so they just <em>relaxed.</em></p><p dir="ltr">They relaxed so much that Rio actually dozed off, falling asleep for roughly a half an hour before the sound of Agatha’s laughter woke her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmmm,” she groaned, lifting her head from the back of the couch. “What’s so funny?”</p><p dir="ltr">“This comment we got on the newest video. I posted it while you were on your way over last night.”</p><p dir="ltr">They’d gotten some pretty funny ones already (‘Holy fuck I’d sell my soul to be your third,’ or ‘How much to get in between you two?’ or even ‘This is what every wet dream I’ve ever had is made of’), but that one in particular seemed to really tickle her.</p><p dir="ltr">“What’s it say?” Rio asked through a yawn, reaching up to cover her mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">“It says…” Agatha snorted again before trying to compose herself to actually read it. “It says, ‘When are we going to get to see Fox bottom? She looks like a total bottom.’”</p><p dir="ltr">Actually, that <em>was</em> funny.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah,” Rio chided, bumping their shoulders together. “When <em>are</em> we going to see that?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I know when,” Agatha hummed, a deep and devious grin revealing sharp teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">She typed her response, her head bobbing arrogantly as she did so.</p><p dir="ltr">‘When we get a $500 tip. 😇”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, she was <em>good.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It likely wouldn’t happen, but the fact she even thought to put it on the table made Rio laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“Did you go to school for business?” Rio teased, poking her in the side.</p><p dir="ltr">“No, actually. I went to school for forensics. Dropped out in my last year.”</p><p dir="ltr">The way she said it with such finality, it didn’t feel like Rio had any right or room to press without possibly pushing a button, so she chose to let it go.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe <em>that</em> was why Agatha was so hellbent on helping her get through school.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well. Maybe you should go back for business.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What for? I already have my own?”</p><p dir="ltr">Fair point.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re right. I really talk out of my ass sometimes.” Rio leaned forward and scooped her wine glass off the table. She sipped at it idly as the dull hum of the television sounded but little else.</p><p dir="ltr">So, to cut the silence, Rio offered Agatha a small taste of her own medicine.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey Agatha?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hm?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Thanks for having me over. I know it’s kind of our norm now… But I’m really only thanking you for it because you won’t let me thank you for anything else.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah, smart girl.”</p><p dir="ltr">If only that were true, maybe Rio wouldn’t have felt the overwhelming urge to kiss her again.</p><p dir="ltr">For once, she stopped holding herself back.</p><p dir="ltr">She set down the glass and reached over, her fingertips grazing Agatha’s far cheek to pull her attention. Their lips brushed, softly and unhurried, before Rio pulled back to look her in the eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">Stupid. Stupidstupidstupid.</p><p dir="ltr">She was so fucking stupid.</p><p dir="ltr">But it didn’t stop her from speaking anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“Really, though. I mean it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s features softened and she kissed Rio again, causing her heart to jackhammer away in her chest. When she pulled back, Rio could literally hear her heart beating in her ears, almost so loudly she missed Agatha’s soft declaration before their mouths met once more.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know you do.”</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">When Rio packed her bag Thursday night, she thought she knew what she was signing up for.</p><p dir="ltr">After spending Friday out with Agatha, she knew trying to predict what the other woman was capable of was fucking stupid.</p><p dir="ltr">It got even worse Friday night.</p><p dir="ltr">They sat on that stupid fucking couch for almost an hour like they were horny-brained teenagers, just making out and touching one another, though no clothes or robes actually came off the entire time they were downstairs.</p><p dir="ltr">In the process, Rio knew what was happening and she knew she needed to either stop it or escalate it to a full fledged fuck fest, but if she was being entirely honest with herself?</p><p dir="ltr">She kind of liked it.</p><p dir="ltr">She liked the innocence of it, the honesty and rawness. It wasn’t rushed by hormones or filled with more than modest intent in the moment, it was simply the two of them locked together in a second out of time that neither wanted to escape.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course they both knew where it would end (as it always did) but right then, it seemed as though the journey was a little more important than the destination.</p><p dir="ltr">Dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">When she fell asleep that night, it was half-covered with her legs tangled in Agatha’s from an angle, though they weren’t quite cuddling.</p><p dir="ltr">Touching but not cuddling.</p><p dir="ltr">They still were not ‘tragic backstory’ friendly yet.</p><p dir="ltr">They certainly could <em>not</em> be ‘platonically soft’ friendly before then.</p><p dir="ltr">It was all so backwards and warped and twisted, but every time Rio thought she found the line between them and knew where not to cross, she blinked and it was gone, moved somewhere new.</p><p dir="ltr">Did she trust Agatha?</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, of course. With more than just her body.</p><p dir="ltr">So why hadn’t she told her the truth already?</p><p dir="ltr">Because she was a coward.</p><p dir="ltr">Thus far, Rio convinced herself Agatha was being kind. Revealing the truth of her past would make that kindness something else.</p><p dir="ltr">It would turn it into pity.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn’t need pity or sympathy. She didn’t need people to feel bad for her or make excuses for her because of the things that happened to her in her past. She’d lost those closest to her and it was nothing more than fact, something she'd been forced to live through and endure.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Her</em> life kept going and she’d be damned if she wasn’t trying her fucking hardest to do something with it.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe the <em>real</em> reason Rio hadn’t told Agatha was solely because she assumed she wouldn’t care.</p><p dir="ltr">That was a pretty big disservice to Agatha, wasn’t it?</p><p dir="ltr">After all, if she didn’t care, would Rio actively spend every minute of her free time at her home, eating her food, drinking her alcohol, climbing into bed with her?</p><p dir="ltr">No.</p><p dir="ltr">Because if Agatha didn’t care, Rio wouldn’t have such an overabundance of free time and what time she <em>did </em>have would have been reserved for brief hook-ups and sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha offered her an out. She took it.</p><p dir="ltr">But she’d fallen <em>into</em> much more than she bargained for.</p><p dir="ltr">For the most part, Friday was used as more of a day to recharge and get their heads on right; the shopping trip helped with that, but their late night make out session turned into what was admittedly rather soft sex kind of tanked any progress.</p><p dir="ltr">So they tried again Saturday.</p><p dir="ltr">It was lazy for the most part, though Agatha <em>did </em>get a little frisky mid-day as Rio tried to make them tea, only to get distracted by Agatha’s hand in her pants for a steady five minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck it, it felt good.</p><p dir="ltr">And who was Rio to deny her?</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the day was slow, casual. They “watched” television (which was mostly Rio napping with her head <em>next to</em> but not <em>on</em> Agatha’s lap and Agatha read while simultaneously playing with her hair in her sleep) and had dinner, finishing the day with a glass of red.</p><p dir="ltr">The day came to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">But the night was just beginning.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the sun set and every trace of dusk light measurably vanished, it was time to get to work. They both showered – separately – and while it seemed counter productive, Agatha informed her that the pre-wash would help the paint stick better.</p><p dir="ltr">“Why do you have the obnoxious habit of researching literally anything and everything to the fullest extent?” Rio called through the shower curtain as she shut off the water. When she pulled it back, Agatha stood proudly at the bathroom counter in a rather uneventful black bra and one of her black panty harnesses with the brightest fucking grin on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because I do things right, obviously,” she answered, brows arching for emphasis. “And to do things right, you have to learn how. Most people think they can just <em>do</em> without the know-how. And I –”</p><p dir="ltr">“‘...am not most people,’” Rio finished, playfully mocking her as she wrapped up in a towel and let her hair down, still dry.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ooooh,” Agatha nearly snarled as she reached out to jerk Rio’s towel off her body, but she was too quick and side stepped her. “Those are fighting words.”</p><p dir="ltr">A grin covered Rio’s face as she practically danced her way to the doorway, a spring in her step.</p><p dir="ltr">“Then come and fight me.”</p><p dir="ltr">When she stepped into the bedroom, she stopped a bit short, a little taken by how much work Agatha managed to do while she was in the shower.</p><p dir="ltr">The bed was completely stripped of its normal linens, replaced instead by ones made of a shiny, thin material that did not look like plastic but maybe something close. Around the edges of the bed on the floor were sheets of plastic, surely to protect the hardwood beneath them from any incursion of wayward paint drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, Rio would hand it to her.</p><p dir="ltr">She was nothing if not thorough.</p><p dir="ltr">“Admiring my handiwork?” Agatha chimed from behind her. When she turned, she couldn’t help but grin at the sight that greeted her.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaning against the frame of the door with her arms crossed and the most annoying smirk on her face, Agatha looked <em>damn good.</em></p><p dir="ltr">That much was always true, but right then it felt <em>especially</em> true.</p><p dir="ltr">Her own feelings aside, Rio knew she was lucky. It wasn’t just how attractive Agatha was, or how rich. It wasn’t about things like wealth and appearance; Agatha was <em>good</em> to <em>her</em>. She wouldn’t go as far as to say Agatha was a completely good person (as she <em>was</em><b><em> </em></b>rather skilled at scamming folks online with her spellcraft business), but she was good where it mattered… and maybe only toward those who mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">It made her even more attractive, if Rio was honest with herself.</p><p dir="ltr">And that made her more dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">But wasn’t that the point of shoving your hand in the fire?</p><p dir="ltr">To feel the burn?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s heat was worth it every single time.</p><p dir="ltr">“I was, actually. You really thought this out,” Rio said, turning to grab her lingerie off the bed to suit up, so-to-speak.</p><p dir="ltr">“I did. So… hear me out.”</p><p dir="ltr">Uh oh.</p><p dir="ltr">That sounded like trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">As she fastened the clasp along her spine, Rio’s dark eyes lifted and pinned Agatha, still in her place against the doorframe.</p><p dir="ltr">“Go on…” she encouraged.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha smirked.</p><p dir="ltr">“No masks.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, that was <em>for sure</em> the definition of a ‘hear me out’ if Rio had ever heard one.</p><p dir="ltr">That sounded like a <em>terrible</em> idea. Even black light was still light and –</p><p dir="ltr">“Let me paint your face.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was clearly watching the devolution of thoughts through dark brown windows and put a stop to it before Rio could spin too far in her own anxiety.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a soft request, but it was…</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Intimate</em>, almost?</p><p dir="ltr">Even if she knew she should, Rio couldn’t say no.</p><p dir="ltr">“And I can do yours?” she agreed by omission, a smile pushing up her cheeks as she crossed the room to place herself directly in front of Agatha. Her hands found Agatha’s sides, pulling her close enough to brave a chaste kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn’t get her smacked or swatted at.</p><p dir="ltr">That was good.</p><p dir="ltr">“Only if you promise to make me look good,” she hummed in answer. Her hands found Rio’s hips over the string of her thong, squeezing firmly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, I would have to try <em>really fucking hard </em>to make you look bad.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re right. You would. So save those efforts for more productive tasks, hm?”</p><p dir="ltr">With a roll of her eyes, Rio gave Agatha a playful push and set off to grab the bags of paint, meeting Agatha on the bed with a giddiness causing her heart to flutter in her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">For thirty minutes, they took turns applying new, painted masks to one another through laughter and giggles and light conversation. When Agatha finished with a few last dots to Rio’s cheeks, she beamed proudly.</p><p dir="ltr">“My doe,” she marveled, clearly pleased with her own work.</p><p dir="ltr">It was funny, admittedly, that she said as much with a face full of well-placed streaks of orange and white that shone in the half-blacklight-half-bedside-lamp-light. When she held up the mirror, she could see Agatha took much the same approach.</p><p dir="ltr">They looked like a hipster moving art piece or some leveled up Banksy installation.</p><p dir="ltr">Honestly?</p><p dir="ltr">It was kind of hot.</p><p dir="ltr">“Bodies next?” Rio braved with a wicked grin that reached her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Bodies next.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was just after eleven by the time they finished, their bodies and lingerie sets ornate with colorfully patterned designs meant to catch the eye but not be the main focus.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the lights went out and the room bathed in a purple glow, Rio really <em>got </em>it.</p><p dir="ltr">Even from across the room, Agatha covered in paint was a fucking <em>sight.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Rio might have been the one to create the art on her skin, but <em>she, herself, </em>was the true work of art. She was poised and beautiful, bright and colorful like a damn peacock that was meant to glow in the dark.</p><p dir="ltr">It was hot.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was hot.</p><p dir="ltr">And Rio couldn’t wait to get her hands on her.</p><p dir="ltr">Wearing a grin that lit up under the purple glow, Rio watched as Agatha sauntered forward and set about turning the cameras on. As her final act of readiness, she slid the dildo into her harness and met Rio at the foot of the bed.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hands raised, cupping gry-paint-covered cheeks and grinned again, her eyes the most remarkable color under the blacklights.</p><p dir="ltr">“No beats, no planning. Just us.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was whispered to her like the sweetest song meant only for her ears, but Rio understood. She understood perfectly. It was “work” in the respect it was for content, but it was also for <em>them</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">As she looked into Agatha’s eyes, she suddenly realized why Agatha suggested the idea for facepaint over masks:</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha kissed her.</p><p dir="ltr">On camera.</p><p dir="ltr">With no need to blur their faces.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t exactly tender, but it wasn’t harsh either. It was a full kiss, rich with lust and a desire to be closer, but it was not entirely overbearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha in a nutshell, really.</p><p dir="ltr">The way her hands dropped to Rio’s waist as she stepped closer and deepened the kiss caused a ripple of excitement to tear up her spine and race back down again, only to start pulsing steadily between her legs. It worsened the moment their bodies sealed together, every inch of flesh touching that could, and Agatha’s stiff strap locked between their bellies.</p><p dir="ltr">It was at that point Rio completely forgot about the cameras.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was right. It was just them. That was all that mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">As the beat of her heart began to sync up with the desperate throbbing between her legs, Rio’s hands found the sides of Agatha’s neck and she deepened the kiss, the tongue begging entrance against Agatha’s lips. The moment she got what she was wanting, it took everything in her power not to simply throw Agatha on the bed and have her way.</p><p dir="ltr">Patience.</p><p dir="ltr">Even without considering the three rolling cameras, Rio wanted it to last.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio indulged in what it was like to just kiss her, to taste the wine still on her tongue and teeth, to be so fucking close that she never wanted to get away. She indulged in what it was to feel her out, to touch her body as their tongues danced and twisted.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had always been divine, but right then it felt like something more.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt like perfection.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hands wandered down Agatha’s back, over her sides and ass to pull her closer. When she broke their kiss to place her lips to Rio’s neck, Rio made her move.</p><p dir="ltr">She was quick as a whip as she stepped into Agatha and spun them slightly so she landed with the backs of her thighs pressed to the edge of the mattress.</p><p dir="ltr">“Show me what you’ve got, my fox,” Rio breathed into her hair, boldly chomping down on the lobe of Agatha’s ear with an enticing tug.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment she let go, she blinked and the scene changed.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of being on her feet and at eye level with the other woman, she was flat on her back and staring at the ceiling with a mega-watt grin on her face, fully on display for the camera mounted to the ceiling. Everything from the flecked colors on the bra that covered her chest to the rather detailed way Agatha painted her ribs and stomach glowed in the dark like a masterpiece meant for the dark and for the eyes of internet strangers to devour.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt surreal.</p><p dir="ltr">And it felt <em>good.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“C’mere,” Agatha growled, strong hands and pointed nails hooked around her thighs and pulled her forward, her ass even with the lip of the mattress. With her so close, Agatha stood proudly between her legs and leaned over, sealing her intent with a kiss that felt like jumping into the heart of a five alarm fire.</p><p dir="ltr">When she pulled away, Rio could see <em>that</em> look in her eyes, even in the dark. The grin she wore was impossibly dangerous and yet, all Rio could do in the moment was beg for it.</p><p dir="ltr">“I need you, my love,” she mewled, moaning the moment Agatha shoved her thighs upward, her knees hovering above her chest as she felt a light pressure against her entrance.</p><p dir="ltr">“Say it again,” Agatha demanded lowly; it was impossibly sexy and yet, something very, very, <em>very</em> small in Rio heard what was truly being asked of her. Yes, they were filming and yes, this was all supposed to be some act, but the tiniest hint of desperation clung to Agatha’s voice.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio gave her what it was she wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">“Please, my love. I need you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha gave another light push to the backs of her thighs, exposing her just a <em>little</em> more, enough so that she could press inside, causing Rio to moan and writhe in her hold. It was arguably not the largest in their collection, but the stretch and fill was immediate and overwhelming in the best way. It was delicious and carnal and raw and honestly, she knew she would never get enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Her thighs snapped inward, creating a firmer pressure, but Agatha had none of it and shoved them back where she had them as she began a steady rhythm.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt so impossibly good, so fucking good that the only thing that mattered right then was the two of them. It was just Agatha’s hands on her body, Agatha’s glow in the dark cock pumping in and out of her while Agatha watched with what Rio could just <em>tell</em> was the most smug expression she could muster.</p><p dir="ltr">Paint covered hands gripped at the protective sheet, hips shifting and lifting to get more of that <em>feeling,</em> that<em> fullness</em> Agatha was always so happy to provide.</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear that while they seemed to have forgotten about their surroundings, Agatha still had every intention of putting on a show. She moved with intent, with thought and calculation. She would slow her thrusts for more of a view of herself and would speed up when Rio made <em>just</em> the right sounds.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a glorious reckoning in every way imaginable, every pump more tantalizing than the one before it.</p><p dir="ltr">“H-Harder,” Rio whimpered, both of her hands flying up to wrap around Agatha’s as she gripped and pulled as if to emphasize her pleas.</p><p dir="ltr">And boy, did Agatha love to listen when it was convenient for the both of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hips canted and bucked, her thrusts deeper and harder, but it wasn’t enough.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio did something she knew she probably shouldn’t have.</p><p dir="ltr">She pulled herself up using the leverage of her hold on Agatha’s wrists and forced her legs down, wrapping them immediately around Agatha’s waist. In the same breath, one arm fell around her neck and the other hand landed on her chest, their lips crashing together the moment they were close enough.</p><p dir="ltr">It was intoxicating and mind-melting to be so fucking close, to have their paint-covered skin pressed together in every place it could be as Agatha kept it up, kept pumping in and out of Rio’s body with each measured slam of her hips.</p><p dir="ltr">And holy fuck did the new angle feel even better.</p><p dir="ltr">Between that, their kiss, and the way Agatha was practically holding onto her for dear life, it all culminated in the most intense storm of pleasure, swirling low in Rio’s belly.</p><p dir="ltr">All it took was one last well-placed thrust for it to all come crashing down. She cried out, both arms wrapping around Agatha’s neck and shoulders as she came, her legs locked around Agatha’s waist like a vice.</p><p dir="ltr">With her eyes squeezed shut and her face half-pressed to the side of Agatha’s head, a series of loud and pleasured moans hit the air around them, captured by each and every mic in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit,” Agatha managed, a bit breathless as she pulled back to look down at Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment their eyes met, her nails unhooked from Agatha’s shoulders and she slumped forward, her head landing in the crook of her neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“You can say that again,” Rio panted in a whisper.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit.”</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">~ * ~</p><p dir="ltr">By the time they wrapped up and sank in the labor of washing off and getting the bedroom back to normal, the time on the bedside clock read nearly 3am.</p><p dir="ltr">“Wanna know something?” Agatha posed as she turned back the corner of the comforter and climbed into bed, smelling of vanilla and strawberries.</p><p dir="ltr">“What’s that?” Rio asked from beside the bed, reaching up to tie her hair into a ponytail.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t think that’ll ever get old with you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha yawned before she even finished speaking, allowing Rio to write it off as her being tired and spent. Truthfully, she only did so because it was way too soft for their friendship and if she bit, it wouldn’t end well for either of them. So she chose to bite in a different way, one that softened the edges of her own feelings.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, so our hook-ups have first escalated to friends with benefits and now we’re just lifelong fuck buddies? Is that it?” she asked through a laugh as she climbed into bed. When Agatha opened up an arm, Rio knew it was stupid but laid down in the cradle it offered anyway, her head landing on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Til libido death do us part?” Agatha giggled, squeezing Rio a little tighter.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sounds like an outstanding arrangement to me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Their joint laughter died down after a moment and the air settled quietly around them, leaving them to slip off to sleep, completely tangled in one another.</p><p dir="ltr">The next morning, Rio woke up to more laughter. It wasn’t loud, but it was close, and her head bobbed a little as a result.</p><p dir="ltr">Because she was still asleep on Agatha’s chest.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Whoops.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmm, what’s all the racket?” Rio grumbled as she sleepily nuzzled into Agatha’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“We have our first mandated assignment for next weekend," she informed in a chuckle, just coded enough that Rio’s still-tired brain struggled to catch up.</p><p dir="ltr">“Huh?”</p><p dir="ltr">“We didn’t just get one tip. We got the original commenter and someone else.”</p><p dir="ltr">Still sleepy.</p><p dir="ltr">Words weren’t making sense.</p><p dir="ltr">Tip?</p><p dir="ltr">Two?</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t be talking about the joke she made about the $500 tip… could she?</p><p dir="ltr">“How much?” Rio grunted into her neck, nowhere near awake enough to hear the answer.</p><p dir="ltr">“A grand between the two.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>WHAT?!</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>A THOUSAND FUCKING DOLLARS JUST LIKE THAT?!</em></p><p dir="ltr">There was no way Rio heard her correctly.</p><p dir="ltr">So she snapped upward and looked down at the other woman, confused dark eyes meeting brightly amused blue ones.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re not serious.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a brief flicker of something on Agatha’s face, so brief that Rio blinked and it was gone, but she still saw it. It was… nervousness? Anxiety? Whatever it was, it seemed to have never existed as Agatha grinned up at her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Deadly serious. It brings the current total to one thousand eight hundred and ninety five dollars.”</p><p dir="ltr">Two thousand dollars.</p><p dir="ltr">Two weeks in and they’d made <em>two thousand dollars. </em>If they kept it up and depending on the split, they could make the goal in only a few months, but Rio knew she was getting ahead of herself.</p><p dir="ltr">In more ways than one, it turned out.</p><p dir="ltr">Her head dropped without a single thought, pressing their lips together in a light kiss that was both tender and appreciative in more ways than she probably should have allowed herself to be. When she pulled back, she realized as much and did her best to recover.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re a damn gift, Agatha Harkness,” she announced decidedly.</p><p dir="ltr">“One that keeps on giving.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Promise?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Promise.”</p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">By 6pm Wednesday when Rio arrived with a bottle of champagne Agatha asked her to pick up, it was to the news that they had broken the four thousand dollar mark.</p><p dir="ltr">“You're fucking kidding me, “ she deadpanned, completely stuck in place a few feet from where Agatha sat on the couch, positively preening.</p><p dir="ltr">“We have thirty-six monthly subscribers, all of the video purchases, and the tips… They all add up.” She said it so casually, so calmly as if she were not relaying the information that they were sure to break five grand in under a month.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha…” she gaped, blinking. For just a second, she wanted to chuck the bottle in her hands and throw herself at the woman on the couch, but somehow managed to practice restraint.</p><p dir="ltr">Ha.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, maybe half-restraint.</p><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Rio set the bottle down on the coffee table with a soft <em>clink</em> and turned to face Agatha, the look of wonder still clearly covering her face. Measured and with ease, Rio lifted a leg and swung it over Agatha’s, straddling her lap with a soft smile as she settled.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can’t believe it,” she braved, her eyes searching Agatha’s face as she tried to find something more intelligent to say. What came out was quite the opposite. “What on earth did I do to deserve you?”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Wow. That was fucking dumb.</p><p dir="ltr">Why the fuck would she say that?</p><p dir="ltr">What in the <em>world </em>possessed her to form those words?</p><p dir="ltr">Before she could spiral too quickly, Agatha simply laughed, offering a very Agatha-esque response.</p><p dir="ltr">“You eat pussy like it's your last meal every time.”</p><p dir="ltr">God. Why would Rio have expected anything less?</p><p dir="ltr">This was Agatha, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">“That's actually fair,” Rio shot back through a smirk, slowly leaning forward. Maybe it was a bit untoward to lean into the intimacy, but Rio wasn't sure she had it in her to care any longer. The moment their lips brushed and she could feel Agatha smile against her, it cemented that very fact.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever would become of them was still a mystery, but Rio was one hundred percent sure she wanted Agatha in her life, no matter what role she chose to fill.</p><p dir="ltr">That night felt like something new, an evolution from one stage of existence to the next.</p><p dir="ltr">As they curled up and Rio set her alarm for class the next morning, she finally felt like maybe they were finally the kind of friends that talked about things, the big things.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was the kind of friend that could be trusted with the truth.</p><p dir="ltr">If only Rio could have managed to tell her then. Instead, she fell asleep.</p><p dir="ltr">When she left for class the next morning, Rio couldn't have known it was the last time she would hear from Agatha until Friday afternoon just before her first class.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a string of blue messages she’d sent over the 2 days prior, all unanswered.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thinking about the other night. Can't wait to see what the final edit looks like.”</p><p dir="ltr">“What do you say I cook us dinner tomorrow?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha? You good?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, just let me know you're alright.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I'm still coming over tonight. Please respond so I know I won't be showing up to a dead body.”</p><p dir="ltr">That one finally got a response.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sick. Rain check for the weekend.”</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>What?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio glanced at the time, a deep frown filling her face the moment she realized she didn't have enough time to call Agatha and figure out what was really going on.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe she <em>was</em> sick. That was a totally plausible thing to happen.</p><p dir="ltr">But that wasn't what Rio’s gut was telling her.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if Rio had gotten good at anything since meeting Agatha, it was ignoring that feeling. Well. Technically, ignoring <em>all</em> feelings, but this was a special case.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was <em>trying </em>to give Agatha the benefit of the doubt. It was very possible she was sick or didn’t feel well, but at the same time, she was <em>not </em>the kind of woman that would ask for help if that were the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Alas, a double edged sword.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio could show up and take care of her friend, no matter how much Agatha tried to fight her, or she could show up to find out Agatha was (for whatever reason) lying to her. Both scenarios had very high probabilities of her being turned away.</p><p dir="ltr">While it might have been a foregone conclusion that Agatha was <em>trying</em> to keep her away, Rio couldn’t help herself. She, in fact, couldn’t help herself <em>so much</em> that she barely heard a single word of her afternoon lecture, far too preoccupied by thoughts of Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew it was in her best interest to downplay whatever weird connection was between them; they were just friends on a surface level, their conversations were never actually deep, and when it came down to it, Rio was certain Agatha would call someone else in a crisis. After all, they’d only known each other a few months.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn’t matter that it <em>felt</em> like they’d been acquainted their whole lives.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn’t important.</p><p dir="ltr">That <em>couldn’t </em>be important.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet it didn’t stop her from wanting to care. Someone that mattered to her was sick and if she could do anything about it, it was damn sure going to try.</p><p dir="ltr">After a class where she learned absolutely nothing, Rio packed her things and headed to a nearby diner on campus. Five minutes later, she walked out with a small bag and a container of chicken noodle soup tucked inside.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever the risk of showing up, Rio would mitigate the cost. At the very least, she just had to know for herself that Agatha was okay.</p><p dir="ltr">She climbed out of the car, bag in hand and her messenger bag over her shoulder and made her way up Agatha’s front steps. When she reached the top, she knew she had a decision to make.</p><p dir="ltr">So, she tapped twice on the door with her knuckles first.</p><p dir="ltr">No answer.</p><p dir="ltr">Two more taps.</p><p dir="ltr">Still no answer.</p><p dir="ltr">So she tried the handle next.</p><p dir="ltr">Surprisingly, it gave and turned to the right, allowing her entry.</p><p dir="ltr">She scanned the living room, half expecting Agatha to be curled up on the couch with a box of tissues, but was met with an empty and unoccupied room. As she turned to shut the door, a surprised sound came from behind her.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>Oh</em>. “</p><p dir="ltr">When she spun in place, the last thing Rio expected was to see Agatha fully dressed in a pair of dark jeans and a violet sweater, hair done, and face made up.</p><p dir="ltr">Her stomach sank instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">“You don't look very sick, “ Rio stated with a neutral tone from her place by the door as Agatha reached the bottom of the stairs, clearly caught off guard.</p><p dir="ltr">“Who just walks into someone’s house?” Agatha questioned coolly, gliding toward the kitchen.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio bristled immediately, her face pinching in annoyance.</p><p dir="ltr">“Cut the shit, Agatha,” Rio clipped, following her to set the soup down on the small table. “What's going on? Why are you bailing and lying about it?” She hesitated on the far side of the kitchen, her arms folded protectively over her torso.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio never once felt the need to keep Agatha out in such a way before, but she did not take kindly to being lied to.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn't matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha couldn't see it anyway. She was too busy pouring herself – and <em>only</em> herself – a drink.</p><p dir="ltr">The longer she took to answer, the more Rio could feel that annoyance ebbing, replaced by something stronger.</p><p dir="ltr">Anger.</p><p dir="ltr">Fear.</p><p dir="ltr">Confusion.</p><p dir="ltr">Worry.</p><p dir="ltr">Why was Agatha shutting her out? Moreover, why was Agatha straight up trying to ignore her when she was <em>right there?</em></p><p dir="ltr">“I have things I need to do,” she finally replied, raising her glass a second later to take a long draw from it.</p><p dir="ltr">“And you couldn't just tell me that?” Rio snapped. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, practically staring a hole in Agatha's back the entire time. “I don't believe you. “</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was rude, maybe it was mean. Rio didn't care. What Agatha was doing right then felt mean. She was lying, she was shutting down, and all Rio wanted to do was help.</p><p dir="ltr">“It doesn't matter, Rio.” That was sharp. It was cold. It was so… Un-Agatha that it was jarring.</p><p dir="ltr">“It does ma–”</p><p dir="ltr">“I just needed a break!” she shouted, her hands flying out as she spun in a dramatic fashion. There was a wild look in her eyes Rio did not understand and honestly, it worried her.</p><p dir="ltr">What the actual fuck was going on?</p><p dir="ltr">How was this happening?</p><p dir="ltr">“A break?” Rio scoffed, rolling her eyes as her arms tightened around her ribs. “A break right before we’re supposed to fulfill our end of a creator/consumer bargain?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh fuck you,” Agatha sneered. “It’s not about the sex and you know it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Honestly, the ‘fuck you’ stung something awful, but Rio instead needed to focus on the latter half of Agatha’s statement.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Rio <em>did </em>know it. Agatha liked to take as much as she liked to give; it was a known fact between them.</p><p dir="ltr">So what <em>actually</em> had her <em>that </em>upset?</p><p dir="ltr">“So then tell me what it <em>is</em> about! We've been friends for months at this point, Agatha. Why the fuck are you suddenly lying to me?”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a fair question, she thought.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did not seem to agree.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don't owe you anything.”</p><p dir="ltr">Was she fucking serious? They set up this entire business arrangement at her behest and now she didn't even owe Rio so much as the truth?</p><p dir="ltr">What the fuck was going on with her?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s gaze narrowed, sharp and cutting as it swept over the woman before her.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that how this goes? You wrangle me in just to fulfill some ego trip for you and when you're bored, you just give me the boot?” She was being harsh, and she could tell as much by the way Agatha's angry mask was starting to slip. “That's all it is, right? Fucking ego? Because it sure as fuck isn't about money for you, is it?!”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s scowl was gone, but her cheeks and forehead were still a deep, deep crimson.</p><p dir="ltr">“It doesn't matter.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was the second time she said it and somehow, it pissed Rio off more than the first.</p><p dir="ltr">“You keep fucking saying that like it's an answer. It's not an answer, Agatha! What was in it for you?!”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn't actually expect an answer. In fact, she was quite certain they were well past the point of having a productive conversation. So when Agatha snapped back with an answer almost immediately, Rio was rather stunned.</p><p dir="ltr">“I just needed a fucking friend! Accountability!” Before she even finished speaking, her hand flew downward and the sound of shattering glass almost overtook her last word.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">How did they get to that point?</p><p dir="ltr">But accountability?</p><p dir="ltr">What did that even mean?</p><p dir="ltr">She should have deescalated, she <em>knew</em> she should have, but something in Rio was already too fired up to let it go.</p><p dir="ltr">“I don't even know what that means! Accountability for what?!”</p><p dir="ltr">That time, when Rio looked up from the shattered glass and whiskey on the floor, she did not see an angry or enraged Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">She saw an upset Agatha instead. A tired Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">An Agatha who, unbeknownst to her, was tired of running.</p><p dir="ltr">“It genuinely doesn't matter, Rio. Please leave.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was getting really good at saying words that felt like physical blows, especially with that tone of voice.</p><p dir="ltr">How did any of this happen?</p><p dir="ltr">“Can you…” Rio started, stepping forward with the intent of helping Agatha clean up. “Can you just talk to me?”</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha issued her command again, the frantic and elevated tone she used before returned and her hands flew up to ward Rio off, as if the gesture alone would push her away.</p><p dir="ltr">“Get out of my house!”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn't want to. She didn't want to listen and take the coward’s way out. She didn’t want to turn her back on someone she cared about when it was clear they were going through something.</p><p dir="ltr">“Please, Agatha…”</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m not going to tell you again.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was dangerous. It was a threat.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay,” Rio offered in surrender, holding her hands up as she took a step back.</p><p dir="ltr">She hated it.</p><p dir="ltr">She fucking hated it.</p><p dir="ltr">She just wanted to know what was wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">She just wanted to talk.</p><p dir="ltr">But Agatha did not, and it <em>was</em> her house.</p><p dir="ltr">“Have a good night, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio shut the door behind her, she couldn’t help but wonder if it was the last time she would get to do so. It was dramatic, maybe, and maybe this was something they could talk about and work through, but it felt pretty final.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was true she’d never seen Agatha angry before, and was living with rose colored glasses on because of it, but her anger felt so unwarranted and exaggerated.</p><p dir="ltr">Even on the thirty minute walk home, Rio failed to come up with any logical rationale that would or could possibly explain what happened. She had the simple facts, sure, but they made no sense without some kind of explanation.</p><p dir="ltr">An explanation she might never get.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, there was no way she was going to simply lie down and give up, but Rio knew as she showered and settled into bed, they both needed some time. Surely it was not Agatha’s intention to completely dissolve their friendship or their working relationship, but she sure as shit needed to work through whatever the fuck was going on in that head of hers.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever it was, it would work itself out.</p><p dir="ltr">It had to.</p><p dir="ltr">It was Rio’s second to last thought before she fell asleep.</p><p dir="ltr">Her <em>very</em> last thought was that she could try again tomorrow.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">When Rio woke up the next morning, everything felt wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">She was in her own bed on a Saturday morning and absolutely no plans to fill her weekend with the usual company.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s company.</p><p dir="ltr">Because, upon some early morning reflection, Rio realized she might have made a misstep or two.</p><p dir="ltr">She panicked and as a result, she overreacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was right:</p><p dir="ltr">Who the <em>fuck</em> just walked into someone’s house? Even more, who walked into someone’s house just to berate and accost them for a personal choice they made? Agatha was well within her rights to turn Rio away, to demand that she leave.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether she lied or not, Agatha’s need for space had been apparent and Rio chose to ignore it. She knew she was trying to be a good and caring friend, but she crossed too many lines in the process and if Agatha’s response to that was to shut her out?</p><p dir="ltr">She kind of deserved it.</p><p dir="ltr">Honestly, maybe if she’d been honest with Agatha before that point, she could have explained herself better, but it didn’t really matter, not actually. Because no matter how afraid she was of being left behind, it was no excuse for exhibiting a flagrant disregard for Agatha’s boundaries.</p><p dir="ltr">If she was real with herself, she was worried. The truth was, their friendship was still rather new and while it was months long at that point, she was afraid she hadn’t given Agatha enough to think she was worth forgiving. It wasn’t like she committed the ultimate indiscretion, but she <em>had </em>been disrespectful. There was no denying that.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was only because Rio knew the truth, her truth.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t lose Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t about the sex, or the porn, or the money. All three of those things were nice, sure, but they weren’t what mattered most.</p><p dir="ltr">No, that was Agatha herself.</p><p dir="ltr">It was her scrunched nose when Rio made a bad joke. It was her laughter when Rio made a good joke. It was the way she stuck her tongue out or pouted when she was being a brat. It was the strength of her embraces and the intensity of her kisses. It was those sleepy smiles first thing in the morning and the kisses to her hairline at night.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had long since admitted to herself that her attraction to Agatha ran far deeper than just the physical and even seeped further down than even sexual.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe if she could have been a grown ass woman instead of a little bitch and just told Agatha the truth, she wouldn’t have been alone.</p><p dir="ltr">And she had an entire fucking day to be alone.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t the worst thing in the world (yes it was) and gave her time to tend to her own dwelling, picking up around her apartment and even deciding to deep clean and rearrange her furniture.</p><p dir="ltr">After what felt like half the day, Rio flipped her phone over to check the time and frowned deeply, severely disappointed by what she saw.</p><p dir="ltr">It was barely two in the afternoon.</p><p dir="ltr">And she did not have a single text message.</p><p dir="ltr">Because why in her right mind would Agatha even consider texting her?</p><p dir="ltr">Could that really just be… it?</p><p dir="ltr">Could they really just end, just like that?</p><p dir="ltr">The thought alone made Rio want to text her, to say she was sorry or she hoped they could talk soon, but she buried the urge. The last thing she needed to do was apply any more pressure and end up wrecking her chances for good.</p><p dir="ltr">So what the fuck did she do for the rest of the day?</p><p dir="ltr">After a shower and a later lunch, she turned on the TV in the front room and laid herself across the couch, wasting twenty minutes alone trying to find something to watch. After settling on some Scottish procedural drama, she grabbed the blanket off the back of the couch and got comfortable.</p><p dir="ltr">Too comfortable.</p><p dir="ltr">When she woke up, it was half past six.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck. Oops.</p><p dir="ltr">When she grabbed her phone, something in her chest ached to see no new messages.</p><p dir="ltr">It sucked.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the consequences of her own fucking actions and it <em>sucked.</em></p><p dir="ltr">With a sigh, Rio quickly ran a mental lap of all the things she could possibly do to keep herself busy, finally landing at the last –and probably worst – one.</p><p dir="ltr">She would go to the bar.</p><p dir="ltr">Terrible idea, especially if Agatha had the same one, but it sure beat the hell out of laying around in her own misery. At least the bar had strong alcohol and a Jen who would probably hassle the hell out of her if she noticed the state Rio was in.</p><p dir="ltr">Because Jen?</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t do nice.</p><p dir="ltr">She did “bully you to the point of realizing life could be much, much worse.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was better than Rio bullying herself, honestly. While she could be a nuisance to others, she was often her own worst enemy and beating herself down was never going to end well.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen doing it for her?</p><p dir="ltr">That was different. It was motivation.</p><p dir="ltr">With another defeated sigh, Rio forced herself up and then got to her feet, lazily slinking to her bedroom to get dressed.</p><p dir="ltr">She could have put on something showy or flashy, something that would undeniably pull the attention of other occupants, but…</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t really want to.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, sure, maybe she wanted to go to the bar to drink and forget about whatever Agatha might possibly be doing without her around, but she didn’t want to act like Agatha didn’t matter at all by going home with someone else. She was upset and maybe a little nervous, but she wasn’t a fucking asshole.</p><p dir="ltr">So, per her typical hobo-chic style, she climbed into a pair of sweatpants, pulled a thin hoodie over her head and tied her hair in a messy knot on top of her head, not a shit given about what she looked like.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha wasn’t the one looking, she didn’t really care.</p><p dir="ltr">After grabbing her keys and wallet, she made her way out and meandered down the block to the bar, enjoying the cool evening air all the while. When she reached the front door, she hesitated, bracing herself for what she was going to walk into.</p><p dir="ltr">She was so right to do it too, mostly because when she pulled it open and stepped inside, the most obnoxiously shrill scream hit her ears.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh my GOD!” Jen shrieked from behind the bar, crystal clear for the six other occupants to hear. “We can call off the search party! Lilia! Get the Coast Guard on the phone! Tell them she’s finally come home!”</p><p dir="ltr">The older woman down the bar top simply rolled her eyes and waved a hand at her empty wine glass, very obviously demanding a refill.</p><p dir="ltr">“I fucking hate you, you certified drama queen,” Rio grumbled as she climbed onto a stool, leaning on her forearms over the bar as Jen appeared in front of her with a wickedly devious grin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sooooo, whatcha been up to, Vidal? It’s been fucking <em>months.</em> Did she finally dump your ass?”</p><p dir="ltr">Fucking ow.</p><p dir="ltr">That wasn’t nice.</p><p dir="ltr">But it should have been expected.</p><p dir="ltr">It was Jennifer Fucking Kale and her very, very limited tact.</p><p dir="ltr">“What makes you think I didn’t dump her first?”</p><p dir="ltr">She knew she shouldn’t have fucking said anything, but she <em>really </em>knew she shouldn’t have said anything when Jen practically grew fangs.</p><p dir="ltr">“Because it’s you we’re talking about. You’d sooner let her step on you in stilettos and put cigarettes out on your skin than dump her first.”</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p dir="ltr">Who the fuck pissed in her Wheaties that morning?</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re being especially awful before I even order a drink,” Rio pointed out, but Jen ignored her and turned around, reaching up for the bottle of WhistlePig that sat on the top shelf. Without a word, she filled it and slid it across the bar, causing it to bump against Rio’s arm, sloshing a bit over it.</p><p dir="ltr">“That one’s on the house because you look like shit. You’re drinking Jack the rest of the night.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to argue just to spite the other woman and insist she could drink top shelf liquor all she wanted, but she knew it was stupid. She might have had thousands of dollars within Agatha’s control, but she barely had enough on her to get sufficiently drunk.</p><p dir="ltr">So she threw the shot back, grateful. She was even more grateful when a shot of Jack miraculously appeared in front of her, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Above it was an open palm, clearly wanting something in return.</p><p dir="ltr">Right.</p><p dir="ltr">Money.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing she shouldn’t be spending.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was better than wallowing around in her own home, sad and pathetic.</p><p dir="ltr">Being pathetic was more fun with an audience, right?</p><p dir="ltr">With a sigh, Rio pulled her card out of her wallet and slapped it into Jen’s awaiting hand, rolling her eyes as the other woman squeaked delightedly and turned away to stow the card for safe keeping.</p><p dir="ltr">“Anything exciting happen around here lately?” Rio asked just before tossing her shot back.</p><p dir="ltr">“She had to throw two kids out the other night. It was pretty funny,” Lilia, the older woman a few seats down offered with a dry laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“It was <em>not</em> funny! That one little shit just kept doing laps around the fucking bar,” she snapped, leveling the other woman with a pointed glare.</p><p dir="ltr">Lilia snorted into her wine.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearly she did not agree.</p><p dir="ltr">“What about you? Commit any crimes in your months-long absence?”</p><p dir="ltr">That was stupid. Jen knew she wasn’t the crime-doing type, but it was obvious she was trying to keep the mood light.</p><p dir="ltr">“Depends,” Rio answered, sliding the glass over to ask for another shot. As Jen complied and refilled the glass, she raised a brow to prompt her to keep talking. “Just how stupid can one person be until it’s considered a crime?”</p><p dir="ltr">While Jen never passed up an opportunity to give Rio hell, she seemed to especially adore those moments – however few and far between they were – where Rio took on the task before she could. Her laughter was undeniable proof.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>That</em> depends. Did you drop out?”</p><p dir="ltr">That was actually the most offensive thing Jen probably could have said.</p><p dir="ltr">But in her defense, it did play into the conversation.</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” Rio returned, trying not to snap. “Not yet anyway. But… I don’t want to talk about it tonight.”</p><p dir="ltr">A low whistle sounded from between Jen’s teeth before she sucked on them and readied her next assault.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tou-chee, jeez,” she grumbled, wiping down a portion of the bar to Rio’s left.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, fuck off and pour me another shot,” Rio said gruffly before pounding back the one in front of her.</p><p dir="ltr">Thirty minutes and two shots later, Rio was drunk.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t ‘go home with a random stranger and spend the next three months fucking them relentlessly under the guise of a good business model’ drunk, but she was pretty toasted.</p><p dir="ltr">So when she pulled out her phone, the smallest voice in the back of her head tried to tell her to put it back.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio In Charge did not listen to that voice even a little.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, she saw the empty screen and decided to do something about it.</p><p dir="ltr">She was going to text Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah!</p><p dir="ltr">But she had to be smart about it.</p><p dir="ltr">Boo!</p><p dir="ltr">At least she wasn’t <em>so</em> drunk that she lost every bit of sense she possessed. In a weekend filled with losses, that was actually a win.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned back on the stool, her focus trained on the phone in her hands. She could do it. She <em>had</em> to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">The silence was fucking killing her.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi, Agatha. Its me, Rio. I just wanted to tell you im sorry. I overstepped like bad and i Really shouldn’t have. Because you matter to me and your feelings do. And I am really sorry. I know I should have just waited til you were ready to see me again I guess I just got nervous that you might not want to. See me again i mean. And then maybe because i was An Asshole and came in uninvited now you might really not want to see me again. And really thats actually pretty fair. Cuz I was an asshole. And I would deserve it. But I hope maybe we can talk soon and I can tell you how sorry I am in person. I still don’t know what you meant by accountability but I AM your friend. Well i want to be if we can still be friends. Im sorry Agatha. I hope you have a good night.”</p><p dir="ltr">Too drunk to give it a second thought, she pressed the send button and locked her phone. When she lifted her head to ask Jen for a glass of water, she was already marching her way down with one in hand.</p><p dir="ltr">“Figured you’d want one before you head home,” she jabbed lightly, causing Rio to pout.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is that you kicking me out?”</p><p dir="ltr">“No, it’s me knowing that look on your face. Any more and we both know you’ll regret it. You can stay as long as you like, but I’ll close your tab.”</p><p dir="ltr">Jen was right. She didn’t need to hammer herself into a blackout state and end up pantless, hung over someone’s backyard fence.</p><p dir="ltr">“I hate that you’re a bartender who gives more of a shit about your patrons’ wellbeing than money. You fucking enigma.”</p><p dir="ltr">Jen barked a laugh, sliding the receipt over for Rio to sign, which she did only after leaving a $10 tip. She would probably regret it in the morning, but Jen deserved it.</p><p dir="ltr">“You can’t come back and spend money if you convince me to give you alcohol poisoning and you die.”</p><p dir="ltr">That time, it was Rio’s turn to laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“You have a fair point.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Drink up, Vidal.”</p><p dir="ltr">Halfway through her glass of water, a miracle happened.</p><p dir="ltr">Her phone buzzed on the bar.</p><p dir="ltr">🦊</p><p dir="ltr"><em>1 New Message</em></p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">With unsteady and shaking fingers, Rio opened the message.</p><p dir="ltr">“I can tell you’re drunk, but thank you for the apology. Have a good night, Rio.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was it?</p><p dir="ltr">That was all she –</p><p dir="ltr">Actually.</p><p dir="ltr">With a deep and slow breath, Rio reframed her thinking.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha said it best.</p><p dir="ltr">Technically, she didn’t owe Rio a thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Any response was a gift and she realized she should take it as such.

<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for Rio, Sunday morning was much of the same, only with a minor headache and an upset stomach thrown in for added flair.</p><p dir="ltr">When she woke up, it was to an empty lock screen and not a sign of Agatha to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh god.</p><p dir="ltr">What did that text even say?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio remembered texting her, of course, but she could not remember exactly what was said in the process. When she pulled up the conversation and briefly skimmed over the wall of text she’d composed the night before, she felt like she was going to be sick. It wasn’t <em>bad</em>, per say, and it was far from <em>terrible</em>, but <em>fuck</em> if it wasn’t embarrassing as hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Especially when Agatha called her out for being drunk.</p><p dir="ltr">While yes, she was an adult and was capable of doing whatever adult activity she wanted to do, she was not above feeling like a scolded child when someone she cared about pointed out her bad behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting drunk was fine. Texting Agatha in the midst of it was where she might have fucked up.</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, it wasn’t like Agatha’s response was cruel or mean. Maybe a little annoyed, but she <em>did</em> thank Rio for the apology, no matter how choppy and poorly worded it was. Maybe Agatha saw her intent over her delivery and that was why she chose to show gratitude instead of getting upset. Even if she would have been angry… Well, Rio felt like she deserved it.</p><p dir="ltr">However.</p><p dir="ltr">The original question still hadn’t been answered.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Why did Agatha bail and lie about it?</em></p><p dir="ltr">There was clearly something Rio was missing, some piece of Agatha she couldn’t see to help her figure out what was going on, but she knew <em>something</em> was wrong. While they’d been friends for a solid three – almost four – months, it honestly felt like so much longer. It felt like they’d been friends for years and yet, they still didn’t know so much about each other, about what made them who they were.</p><p dir="ltr">What if they would have just had those conversations? What if Rio would have gotten the will to be honest about why she was in college in her mid-thirties and why she was working so hard to get her damn degree.</p><p dir="ltr">Would Agatha have talked back?</p><p dir="ltr">Would she have admitted all the things that turned her into a charismatic recluse who (more often than not) scared the townspeople? Would she have told Rio why she was sitting on a fortune and living an otherwise mundane life?</p><p dir="ltr">Did it matter now?</p><p dir="ltr">She was still half-convinced Agatha might never speak to her again.</p><p dir="ltr">That made for a fun Sunday.</p><p dir="ltr">At least for a couple of hours, Rio managed to distract herself by going to the store to stock up for the week on groceries. As it stood, she was quite certain she would be spending the following week alone and purchased a six pack of beer in anticipation.</p><p dir="ltr">Jen might bitch again, but whiskey was fucking expensive.</p><p dir="ltr">She toiled away her day by touching up a few spots she’d missed the day before on her cleaning spree and tried to distract herself with television first to no avail, and then ended up scouring the app store for some mindless game to play. That didn’t work either.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time the sun began to drop in the sky, she knew she should probably feed herself. It was a quick dinner of ramen with a chicken breast and some extra chili oil, but it fed the machine and caused her stomach to stop all the noise it was making.</p><p dir="ltr">Less than an hour after sundown, Rio couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p dir="ltr">All she did as she cleaned and watched TV and played on her stupid phone was think about Agatha, about how she was still quiet and probably upset. She knew they needed to have a conversation, they both did. So why was she prolonging it?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio hated it.</p><p dir="ltr">Chewing on her lip, she picked up her phone and slowly typed a message.</p><p dir="ltr">“Can I come over?”</p><p dir="ltr">She knew the likely answer would be no, but it didn’t hurt to ask at the very least. She sent the message and laid her phone on the back of the couch, wandering down the hallway to the bathroom. Mid-pee, she heard her phone go off.</p><p dir="ltr">That was fast.</p><p dir="ltr">Could be good.</p><p dir="ltr">Could be bad.</p><p dir="ltr">Either way, she needed to know.</p><p dir="ltr">After washing her hands, she scrambled out and grabbed up her phone, opening Agatha’s message instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">🦊</p><p dir="ltr">“You can do anything you want. There is no one to stop you. But it doesn’t mean I have to let you in.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was actually a fair response, even if it was kind of annoying. Rio sighed, staring down at her phone with a deep crease in her brow. It wasn’t exactly an invitation, but it wasn’t a flat out ‘no’ either. That was for a reason. Because Agatha was intentional, always.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay. I’m coming over.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a quick response and Rio was off, pulling on a sweatshirt and pair of pants over her shorts before her feet slipped into shoes and she was out the door, ordering a ride.</p><p dir="ltr">When she arrived at Agatha’s and slowly made her way up the front walk, she realized she didn’t have a plan. What was she supposed to do if Agatha really wasn’t going to let her in, like she said? It might have seemed like a good idea to jump at what little she was given, but she hadn’t taken the time to actually parse it out and figure out the best way to tackle it.</p><p dir="ltr">The only place she could start was to knock on the door, so she did.</p><p dir="ltr">“I meant what I said.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was close, way too close, like Agatha was already at the door.</p><p dir="ltr">“That you’re not going to let me in?” Rio asked back softly, pressing her forehead to the small crack where the frame and the door met.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">Well, shit. She should have expected it; rarely did Agatha say things she didn’t mean, but maybe she’d been a little disillusioned in her blind hope to think once she got there, Agatha might change her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay,” Rio said, exhaling a soft sigh. “Is it okay with you if I sit down? You can turn the porch light out so no one sees me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was stupid to insist she was going to stay, but at least that time she had the decency to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes.”</p><p dir="ltr">And just like that, the light above her head went out. She peeled her head back from the cold wood of the door and heaved another quiet sigh, staring at it for a moment before she lowered herself to the ground and pressed her back to it. Not a moment later, she felt the tiniest shift in the door as Agatha sat down on the other side and leaned against it.</p><p dir="ltr">The silence for Rio was only broken by the soft sound of crickets chirping away, singing their song to the night. She heard nothing on the other side of the door, but the way it jostled slightly every so often reminded Rio that Agatha was still there.</p><p dir="ltr">It had to have been at least ten minutes by the time Rio decided she could no longer take the silence.</p><p dir="ltr">“I want to tell you something,” she began, only loud enough to be heard through the door. She pulled her knees up to her chest and tucked her arms in, picking at her cuticles in nothing more than a nervous habit.</p><p dir="ltr">“When I was eighteen, my younger brother was in a pretty bad car accident. It… It paralyzed him from the neck down and he was in a coma for two months. When he came out of it… He needed a lot of attention.” She fell quiet and took in a deep breath, trying to level herself. “That fell to me. I didn’t have a steady job or a household to take care of. All I was going to do was go to college, but Mateo needed me. So I was there.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was the softest tremble to her voice, one she tried hard to fight.</p><p dir="ltr">“When I was twenty, he finally passed and I know it was the happiest day for him. He was so fucking miserable, so hopeless. And I never blamed him. Two years later… My dad had a stroke. It happened at work and led to an accident, so it wasn’t just the typical, run-of-the-mill tragic life-altering circumstance. It got a lot worse.”</p><p dir="ltr">Part of Rio wanted to stop, to get up off that front porch and just walk away, but she knew she owed it to Agatha to be honest.</p><p dir="ltr">“Three years later, he died, too. And even with me still around, and twenty-five, it wasn’t enough for my mom. The doctors said her heart gave out, but I think she just died of loneliness. Her son, her husband were both gone and I…”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio exhaled a devastated chuckle, hanging her head.</p><p dir="ltr">“I wasn’t good enough for her to keep going. So… I took time to mourn and to grieve. I buried the three people I loved most in a six year span. And it fucking sucked. But then… Then I realized I could still be someone. I could still do things that they would have been proud of, things they would have loved to have witnessed. And that… That’s why I’m in my thirties trying to finish my last fucking year of my masters. Because I… I still want to be someone.”</p><p dir="ltr">And there it all was, laid out cleanly and precisely in the best way she could put it.</p><p dir="ltr">“But in all that time… It’s been hard to make impactful relationships. People get bored, they get tired, they leave. And I… I panicked that you were going to follow suit the other night. And it made me do things I’m definitely not proud of. So even though I can’t look you in the eye and say it… I’m really sorry, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wasn’t expecting some immediate throwing-open of the door, but the silence that followed was hard. She just wanted to look at Agatha, to make her see how much she meant it. Instead, all she could do was sit in the silence of the night and hope something came of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After an additional five minutes, something did.</p><p dir="ltr">“Almost four years ago, my son died.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was almost <em>too</em> quiet to be heard through the door, but it hit Rio’s ears all the same. Her head lifted and tipped back, landing gently against the door.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">That was awful.</p><p dir="ltr">Losing everyone around her was most certainly a trying time, but losing a kid?</p><p dir="ltr">Jesus.</p><p dir="ltr">“He was four, almost five, and was very adamant about learning to ride a bike. And I…” Agatha’s voice cut out and the softest sob left her before her head hit the door with a soft thud. “I let him get <em>just that little bit</em> ahead of me. And I fucking regret it.” Her voice was so pained, so raw, and Rio could feel it ripping her chest open.</p><p dir="ltr">“He couldn’t slow down and got out into a crosswalk. There was a car that had a stop sign and… They didn’t use it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only had she lost her child, she watched him die in front of her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“I… His name was Nicky.”</p><p dir="ltr">Nicky.</p><p dir="ltr">A sweet name for a sweet boy, Rio was sure.</p><p dir="ltr">She did not say anything but <em>did</em> intentionally lean against the door, a silent signifier that she was still there and still listening to every word Agatha had to say.</p><p dir="ltr">“The driver was some tech COO dickhead with more money than sense. So while he didn’t go to jail because he bought his way out… I wrung him out to dry in civil court. Judges are pretty favorable to grieving mothers, as it turns out.” Agatha was clearly still struggling to force the words out, but Rio could hear more than what she was saying aloud.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha knew money wouldn’t buy her son’s life back, but it would make sure she lived in comfort for the rest of her life.</p><p dir="ltr">“A week later, literally the day before my mother was set to have me written out of her will… The bitch actually went and had a heart attack and fucking died.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was actually rather startling to hear the complete shift in Agatha’s tone. Clearly, there was bad blood there and thus, her mother’s passing did not impact her in nearly the same way as her son’s.</p><p dir="ltr">She got quiet again, holding onto the silence a little longer, though Rio realized she was not finished speaking. After another couple of minutes, Agatha’s voice filtered through the door again.</p><p dir="ltr">“All of this money, everything that makes me comfortable…” She cut herself off and cleared her throat, clearly getting emotional again. “I told myself that when we hit five grand, that big of a marker, I would tell you why I was doing it and what I needed from you. But I didn’t. I panicked. Because it’s… it’s stupid and I don’t want it to change how you see me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Didn’t she understand? Rio didn’t actually care about passing any kind of moral judgements. She wasn’t exactly a saint herself, obviously.</p><p dir="ltr">“It won’t, Agatha,” Rio assured her quietly, turning her head toward the crack in the door.</p><p dir="ltr">She was quiet for a moment, shifting slightly against the door before she finally spoke.</p><p dir="ltr">“After Nicky was buried… I never went back to the cemetery. I… I never even ordered him a headstone. And so… When we hit that big number, I wanted to do it because I was certain by that point, you wouldn’t leave. But… I also thought I’d have a couple of months to gain the courage in the meantime. I didn’t expect it to happen so fast.”</p><p dir="ltr">The more Agatha went on, the more Rio’s heart seemed to shatter in her chest. Never once would she have looked at Agatha and assumed any of these things about her. She walked on, arrogant and snappy, always ready for a fight. She held her head high, never letting it seem as though the world was getting her down.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a choked cry on the other side of the door and Rio crumbled. Yes, she understood at that point that Agatha had done all of this on purpose, wanted to have that particular conversation without being looked at or having to look at Rio, but the worst was over. The storm was passing.</p><p dir="ltr">So she tried one more time.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting to her knees, she pressed her head to the door again and released a broken plea.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha, will you please open the door?”</p><p dir="ltr">Again, little more than silence greeted her –</p><p dir="ltr">Until!</p><p dir="ltr">The door rattled slightly, followed immediately by the sound of a turning lock.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh thank god.</p><p dir="ltr">Quickly, she was scrambling to her feet and breathing a sigh of relief the moment Agatha pulled the door open. Her cheeks were flushed and wet, but Rio didn’t care. She was just thankful Agatha had <em>finally</em> let her in, in more ways than one. She told her the truth, explained almost every mystery, and let Rio simply be her friend.</p><p dir="ltr">The trauma sharing kind of friends, not just the kind of friends who liked to fuck each other for money.</p><p dir="ltr">True friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah right.</p><p dir="ltr">But that would be a conversation for another day. Right then, all Rio wanted to do was wrap her arms around Agatha and not let her go. Kicking the door behind her, she did just that as she wrapped her arms around the other woman and pulled her close, feeling the embrace returned immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s going to be okay,” Rio told her, squeezing her tightly. “We’ll figure it all out together.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did not offer any kind of verbal response, but she did loosen her hold only to drag Rio over to the couch so they could lay down, wrapped in one another. The tears stopped at some point and right before Rio let herself drift all the way to sleep, there was something she wanted Agatha to know.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey Agatha?” she whispered into Agatha’s hair. A hand lightly rubbed at her back, a light probe to see if she was awake.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hmm?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I can help you. Pick one out, I mean. A headstone. And I… I’d go with you when it’s placed.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha nuzzled into her a little more, another sad hum falling from her.</p><p dir="ltr">“That would be really nice of you.”</p><p dir="ltr">With a small smile just before she dozed off, Rio offered one last thing.</p><p dir="ltr">“That’s what friends are for.”</p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr">Somehow, the two of them slept through the night.</p><p dir="ltr">It made no sense given their arrangement on the couch and the way they were still so snugly wrapped around one another, but Agatha had at some point pulled the blanket over them, keeping them warm throughout the chill of the night.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio’s alarm went off, shouting at her to get up and get ready for class, she knew she didn’t have much time. She needed to get home, change, get her things, and make it to campus in time to not get locked out of her morning lecture.</p><p dir="ltr">That would have been fine and dandy, but the last thing she wanted was to get up from that couch.</p><p dir="ltr">The night before hadn’t been easy, but it was all out in the open and honestly, she had a little clearer idea of what was constantly going on in Agatha’s head.</p><p dir="ltr">She was trying to outmaneuver her grief, but she was doing it in a way completely opposite to the one Rio had chosen for herself. Where Rio embraced her loss and used it as motivation to do better, Agatha ran from hers. She shoved it away and tried to ignore it because facing it meant accepting her own form of blame.</p><p dir="ltr">From what Agatha told her, did Rio think it was her fault?</p><p dir="ltr">Of course not.</p><p dir="ltr">But Agatha likely held her dying son in her arms and watched the person responsible walk off without spending a day in jail, all because he used to have money. Used to. Because it was Agatha’s money now. Apparently added to a pile of it from a mother who did not like her enough to want to keep her in the will. Funny how that worked out.</p><p dir="ltr">But knowing all of this, knowing what Agatha was needing now, it made it even harder for her to motivate herself to get up and climb off of the couch and greet the day.</p><p dir="ltr">She really shouldn’t have taken that one Friday off.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha grunted beside her as her alarm was turned off and chose to snuggle in closer, Rio could have just about cried with how badly she did not want to get up and leave. She would have done anything possible to just stay a little longer, to hold on a little tighter, but she knew she had little choice in the matter.</p><p dir="ltr">“I need to go,” she whispered against Agatha’s forehead, her fingers raking gently through her hair. “I have class this morning.”</p><p dir="ltr">Another grunt came from Agatha, her arms tightening around Rio’s middle in defiance.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know,” she voiced, countering what she was physically doing. Her mouth opened in a yawn and she loosened her hold, leaning back to open her eyes and peer into the dark ones already focused on her. “Do you think you might like to study or do homework here tonight?”</p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">What?</p><p dir="ltr">Was she serious?</p><p dir="ltr">It was clearly a breach of their priorly established schedule, but Rio could tell she meant it. She genuinely wanted her there, to spend more time together even if she knew it could only be in a way where they shared space over conversation. She was fully of the understanding what school meant to Rio and just how fucking important it was and yet, she was offering her the chance to have both things at once.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t wild and raunchy sex, with or without cameras, and it wasn’t some washed-out excuse as to why they could spend time together. It was a genuine invitation to simply coexist.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re sure?” Rio asked quietly, her eyes darting back and forth between Agatha’s, like she might find the joke there somewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">“You should bring what you need for tomorrow morning, too. Just skip the whole unnecessary trip home ordeal and go straight to campus.” The way she suggested it, Agatha almost sounded like Rio should have thought of it first, but they both knew she was not going to push those limits.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio studied her, quiet with contemplation before her lips cracked into a grin and she posed a playful question. “Should I just pack for the whole week?” Her brow raised to accentuate her comedic predisposition, but Agatha didn’t even fucking blink.</p><p dir="ltr">“If you want to, you should.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, sly little fox she was. She wasn’t giving an outright yes but was instead leaving the choice up to Rio. She was the one who had class, who had prior obligations. She could fully understand why Agatha wanted her to be the one to make the choice. At the same time, the last thing she wanted to do was overstep again, even unintentionally.</p><p dir="ltr">“Tonight and tomorrow,” Rio offered, kissing Agatha’s forehead before she gingerly untangled them and begrudgingly pulled herself from the couch. “Wednesday night, I’ll go home and come back Friday. Fair shake?” She glanced over her shoulder as she slipped on her shoes, catching Agatha’s eye.</p><p dir="ltr">“Fair shake,” Agatha agreed, a warm expression softening her features.</p><p dir="ltr">Hesitating by the door, Rio turned in place, fully facing an Agatha who was still sprawled out on the couch. “Have a good day, Agatha. I’ll see you later.”</p><p dir="ltr">Although she was clearly still fighting such an abrupt awakening from an immeasurably deep sleep, the dreamiest smile overtook her. “I’ll see you later, Rio.” The look on her face was sweet, as if she were tasting those words on her tongue for the first time with a brand new flavor. It melted Rio, made her want to dart back across the living room and spend the entire day tangled in Agatha on the couch, but she had responsibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Academics.</p><p dir="ltr">Being a goddamn adult.</p><p dir="ltr">She never signed up for this shit.</p><p dir="ltr">With one last smile and a quick wink, Rio set off to endure another agonizingly slow and mediocre day where she <em>did</em> manage to learn a thing or two. Her morning classes passed a little faster than the afternoon ones, but she was more than relieved by the time three thirty struck that afternoon and she could scramble her way out the doors and make a direct path for exactly where she wanted to be:</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe there were still some things that might eventually need hashed out between them, but for the most part, Rio liked where they were. She liked knowing they could talk about the tough things, the things that were best left tucked away in the dark. She liked knowing that even if something happened, even if a rift opened up between them, they had a way forward if they got out of their own first.</p><p dir="ltr">The only way they were ever going to do that was together.</p><p dir="ltr">And that was the way Rio was starting to like it.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a nice idea, wasn’t it? Her and Agatha. Together.</p><p dir="ltr">That was one of those things that would require a good hashing, but maybe over the weekend. For the first time on a Monday night, Rio simply wanted to exist in Agatha’s presence in whatever way she would allow.</p><p dir="ltr">As it turned out, it was the kind of way where she made them dinner and poured them wine. It was the kind of way where she let Rio sit in the plush arm chair while she stretched out on the couch and propped a book open in her lap. At Rio’s request, the television played lowly in the background, even if neither of them were watching it.</p><p dir="ltr">The noise was just nice.</p><p dir="ltr">The quiet was hard and while Agatha was being genuinely respectful about her need to focus on her work, she knew having her so close and sitting in silence would probably physically sting. At least with the hushed voices from the TV, it didn’t feel so heavy.</p><p dir="ltr">For hours, she pored over laptop, fixing equations and explaining the theories before she finally closed it and looked up to see something pretty damn beautiful.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha, clad in her purple silk robe, was out cold on the couch with her book open on her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, Rio never promised to entertain.</p><p dir="ltr">With a soft chuckle, she stowed her things in her bag and peeled herself out of the chair, moving to squat down in front of Agatha as she reached up to lightly run her fingers through her hair. She stirred only minutely, not actually opening her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Wake up, Agatha,” she soothed softly. “It’s late. Let’s get in bed.”</p><p dir="ltr">With a soft grumble, clouded blues sprung to life and glanced around, gauging her surroundings in those first moments of consciousness. As it all fell into place, she slowly sat up and raised her gaze to fall on Rio’s outstretched hand. Without a single word, she took it and stood, following Rio up the stairs, quiet like mice.</p><p dir="ltr">They parted at the foot of the bed and climbed in on their opposite sides, though the way Agatha reached over and pulled her toward the middle only half surprised her. It wasn’t overly affectionate, but it was clear Agatha wanted the closeness, and wanted the promise that Rio meant it when she said she wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p dir="ltr">They repeated the same routine the following night, except Rio was the one to fall asleep with about two equations left on her assignment. When she stirred, it was only because Agatha was closing her laptop and moving it to the coffee table, kissing the side of her head with a soft whisper.</p><p dir="ltr">“Bedtime. Come on.”</p><p dir="ltr">Not only were those the first two weeknights they spent together outside of their typical Wednesday rendezvous, but they were the first two nights in the history of their entire friendship – situationship, whatever they were calling it – where sex never really crossed their minds. It was strange to think about it in retrospect, but at the same time, it was nice.</p><p dir="ltr">It was nice to just hang out, to be close, to fall asleep and not be so alone.</p><p dir="ltr">It made Wednesday night and Thursday night pretty insufferable.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, there were about eight separate occasions where Rio <em>almost</em> broke down and called Agatha to see if she could just come over and finish her work there. She fought the urge on every single occasion, even though she was sure it would have been less painful to peel her fingernails off the quicks.</p><p dir="ltr">She needed to keep her head on straight. School still mattered. Everything else with Agatha could be dealt with over the weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">It was like some mantra playing on repeat in her head throughout class on Thursday, one that only silenced when her phone rang some time after 7 that night.</p><p dir="ltr">🦊</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Incoming Call</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Well, hello,” Rio greeted warmly as she placed the phone to her ear.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hi,” Agatha greeted, clearly in the midst of chewing on something crunchy. “Sorry, I didn’t expect you to pick up so fast.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, well, any distraction is a welcome one. Is everything okay?” She wasn’t exactly <em>concerned</em>, as Agatha still preferred to call over text, but better to ask than wonder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah, everything’s fine,” she assured, sounding pretty convincing. “I was just thinking… What if I meet you on campus tomorrow afternoon and we grab dinner and come back here?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio almost asked. It almost flew out from between her teeth, but thankfully, she stopped it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Like a date?</em></p><p dir="ltr">That was stupid.</p><p dir="ltr">Best not.</p><p dir="ltr">“Like, grab something or sit-down?” she inquired, feeling it was a fair question.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was quiet for a moment as she thought about it before decisively landing on an answer.</p><p dir="ltr">“I would say it’s up to you, but you will agree to go out-out even if you’re deadbeat tired. So we’ll grab Mexican or something and come back. I’ll even run you home so you can grab a bag.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio snorted. “Gee, that is mighty considerate of you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I am nothing if not a gracious host.”</p><p dir="ltr">Wasn’t that the truth?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did as she said and was waiting curbside as Rio exited her last lecture for the week, wearing both a pair of Ray Bans and a million dollar grin. They grabbed dinner and made their way back to Agatha’s to settle in for the evening.</p><p dir="ltr">A couple hours after dinner and a brief little dalliance on the couch, they filled their wine glasses and grabbed a snack of green grapes, as if the fermented liquid ones were not enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Although she was finished with her work for the week, Rio still posted up in the arm chair as they watched some random show and munched on their grapes. When she reached for another a few minutes later, she was dismayed to find her bowl empty.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey,” she called, shifting in the chair to face Agatha a little more. “You still have some. Share.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a demand, but Rio was grinning like an idiot.</p><p dir="ltr">She would have kept grinning, but Agatha lobbed a grape at her.</p><p dir="ltr">And she caught it in her fucking mouth.</p><p dir="ltr">She chewed and swallowed, beaming the whole time as Agatha stared at her in astonishment.</p><p dir="ltr">“How the fuck…?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio preened, clearly delighted by Agatha’s reaction.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mouth-eye coordination, of course. Bet I could do it again.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a challenge, one Agatha took her up on as she plucked another grape from its stem and tossed it in Rio’s direction. She had to move a little more that time, but again, she caught it.</p><p dir="ltr">And Agatha just <em>laughed.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It was so loud and bright and filled with joy, so much so it made Rio feel warm from head to toe.</p><p dir="ltr">And then Agatha said something that set her ablaze.</p><p dir="ltr">“I fucking love you, you idiot.”</p><p dir="ltr">It took a minute, surpassing the sound of Rio’s own laughter, but delayed processing caught her up with a fucking <em>quickness.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Agatha said </em><b><em>what?!</em></b></p><p dir="ltr">She blinked, completely confused</p><p dir="ltr">No way</p><p dir="ltr">No way it was that easy.</p><p dir="ltr">But as she stared at Agatha, she looked just as struck and shocked at the words that left her own lips.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to ask her to repeat it, but she didn’t want to shatter the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, she launched to her feet and practically threw herself into Agatha’s lap, scooping her up by the jaw to give her a rich and emotional kiss, one that could say much more than she was capable of right then.</p><p dir="ltr">When she pulled away, she pressed their foreheads together but left her eyes closed for the sake of maintaining her own bearings.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, she said it.</p><p dir="ltr">“I love you too, you utter genius.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha breathed the lightest laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“At least you recognize which of us is smarter.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was a contest Agatha would always lose, but only because Rio was smart enough to let her in and not give up on her.</p><p dir="ltr">In return, she was getting the greatest gift of all:</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha Harkness herself.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">While she was fully aware it was all in her mind, Rio felt like there was something new in the air when she woke up Saturday morning, fully tangled in Agatha in the middle of the bed with both of them stark naked. The press of flesh to flesh was homely and comfortable and Rio reveled in the feeling of Agatha’s arm draped over her stomach.</p><p dir="ltr">But something else was new, too.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a lightness to the air as Rio breathed in and exhaled, a sense of new beginnings tasting sweet on the tip of her tongue.</p><p dir="ltr">Things changed, yes. That was undeniably true. They’d shared their motivations and intentions, everything laid bare. It was a fresh start, a way to advance another level and go from there. It would have been enough for Rio; it was still forward progress, after all, but Agatha just had to go and out-do herself every damn time.</p><p dir="ltr">After a couple of hours spent tangled in one another where neither of them braved to repeat the sentiment, Rio had laid awake well after Agatha fell asleep, thinking.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t even thinking, really.</p><p dir="ltr">She was just replaying that moment in her head.</p><p dir="ltr">Over and over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“I fucking love you, you idiot.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio was no stranger to sharing strong platonic love in her past friendships, but with the way things had changed between them, she had been so certain in that moment that Agatha was <em>not</em> being platonic.</p><p dir="ltr">The hours of rather soft but still feral sex proceeding definitely assured her of that.</p><p dir="ltr">But still, the way it had fallen from her lips, not like an accident, but a sly admission… It made Rio think and feel and twist and turn at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was not a careless person, she did not often say things she did not mean, even in anger. When Rio upset her, she did not call her names or berate her. In fact, given the circumstances, Rio thought she remained pretty calm at the time. But she was not careless in other ways, either.</p><p dir="ltr">For her to say she loved Rio, that was intentional.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio, of course, knew how she herself felt and was biting it back for the sake of not running their friendship into the ground, but the second Agatha gave her the green light, it was over. Sure, there was still anxiety to be had about how often it could be said and other nuanced ideologies regarding love, but for the time being, she just wanted to be happy.</p><p dir="ltr">Happy and loved.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been a while for Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">But it was nice.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmmm, is it morning?”</p><p dir="ltr">She could feel Agatha’s breath on her back as she asked her soft question, holding Rio around the middle a little tighter.</p><p dir="ltr">“It is. The sun is up,” Rio murmured back, laying her arm over Agatha’s as she scooted back as much as she could into the curve of Agatha’s body.</p><p dir="ltr">“Does that mean we have to be?” she grumbled, pressing her face into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“Not if you’d invest in blackout curtains,” Rio teased, giving her arm a light squeeze.</p><p dir="ltr">“Noted.” She paused only to yawn, loud and dramatic in typical Agatha fashion. “Do you want to do anything today? Lunch? The park?”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, stop it. She couldn’t go getting all domestic <em>that</em> fast.</p><p dir="ltr">“I had something else in mind,” Rio informed her, rolling in place so they were face to face. “Maybe not today, but… tonight. We make the video.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was a dry way to bring up the topic, especially diverting Agatha’s attention back to the total number even though the worst was already over, but Rio wasn’t quite finished.</p><p dir="ltr">“Low lights. No masks. We can work the angles and you can blur. What do you say?”</p><p dir="ltr">The most minute shifts in Agatha’s face happened – a twitch by the corner of her mouth and another near the inner part of her left eyebrow, just above her nose – and for a moment, Rio thought she was going to flat out turn down the idea.</p><p dir="ltr">When a second later, her lips pulled back into a gentle smile, she exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.</p><p dir="ltr">“I think that would be a good idea.” Agatha sealed her statement with an unassuming kiss, the only one since they’d met. It wasn’t demanding or hurried or requiring something else, it just was.</p><p dir="ltr">“And for the record, I think lunch in the historic village would be a great idea,” Rio teased against her lips, taking one more kiss before rolling away to climb out of bed and scamper off to the bathroom.</p><p dir="ltr">As she flushed and pulled open the door, she was only mildly surprised to see Agatha in the doorway, grinning like the Cheshire Cat himself.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, hello. And what are you doing ‘round these parts?” Rio quipped playfully in a shitty and half-assed cowboy accent.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re fucking weird,” Agatha jabbed with a roll of her eyes. Amusement aside, she looked back into those waiting brown eyes and grinned again. “Wanna shower?”</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t groundbreaking for them, but like the air and the light and everything else, something about Agatha’s request felt <em>new</em>. And Rio liked it. She liked it <em>so</em> much she barely wasted a second before replying.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes. Of course. Let’s shower.”</p><p dir="ltr">She should have known ‘shower’ was code for ‘wash off and also fuck’ but she had been naive in the moment. Not that she was complaining.</p><p dir="ltr">How could she ever complain?</p><p dir="ltr">After the water ran cold and they hurried to finish up, they dressed for the day (with Rio <em>actually</em> putting on a pair of nice bootcut jeans and an olive colored sweater with a modest neckline) and headed out, grabbing lunch and doing some light window shopping.</p><p dir="ltr">It was kind of weird to sit in a restaurant with Agatha, holding light and playful conversation while anyone could have looked over and spotted them together. It wasn’t like it was a secret that they knew each other, but to that point, they’d done a rather bang-up job of keeping everything as low-key as humanly possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Throwing it to the wind just felt new and maybe a little strange.</p><p dir="ltr">They stopped at a grocery store on the way back to the house and while Agatha clearly had a plan of what she wanted to grab, Rio matched pace with her and slipped her hand inside Agatha’s gripping lightly.</p><p dir="ltr">“Can <em>I</em> cook <em>you</em> dinner tonight?” she half-hummed, leaning toward Agatha so there was no need to raise her voice.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh?” Agatha asked with a smirk. “Cooking me dinner <em>and</em> a low-lit night of sex? Are you trying to schmooze me, my doe?”</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing her call Rio that pet name was…</p><p dir="ltr">You guessed it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>So fucking new.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t the first time, but it never really had that tenderness to it before. It was teasing and yet, it was affectionate in the most genuine way.</p><p dir="ltr">In turn, Rio decided to play her game right back.</p><p dir="ltr">“Whatever keeps you happy, <em>my love.</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha stiffened beside her but continued to walk, as if a shiver shot up her spine.</p><p dir="ltr">Ohhhh. <em>She liked that.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Get what you need,” she ordered, her voice low all of a sudden.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh shit! Rio had <em>really</em> stamped a button.</p><p dir="ltr">“Are we done perusing?” It was a sarcastic jab, but Rio couldn’t help herself.</p><p dir="ltr">“I suddenly don’t give a fuck about groceries or what we eat for the next two days, if that’s any indication.” Agatha wasn’t <em>snapping</em> at her, but her tone was most certainly tight with her sudden want to be out of the public eye.</p><p dir="ltr">With a snide chuckle and an arrogant smirk on her lips, they gathered everything Rio needed to make Chicken Masala and promptly exited the store. Agatha was eerily silent as she climbed in and they drove off, but instead of going left toward home, she went right.</p><p dir="ltr">“Uh… Where are –”</p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t ask questions. Give me five minutes.”</p><p dir="ltr">She navigated the decently sized SUV through residential streets toward a park.</p><p dir="ltr">What the fuck?</p><p dir="ltr">No park!</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to go back to the house!</p><p dir="ltr">But Agatha didn’t stop at the parking lot. She kept going, slipping down a drive that ran through a thick patch of trees. After another minute, they were secluded and tucked away in a little corner of the forest and Agatha cut the engine. Before Rio could even get a question out as to what the fuck was going on, Agatha’s seatbelt was off and she was climbing into the back, slouching into the bench seat with a wicked grin on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio looked back at her, both eyebrows shot up and asked the question before she did.</p><p dir="ltr">“What are you waiting for?”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted to fuck right then and there.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t want the twenty minute drive home.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was suddenly sweating bullets.</p><p dir="ltr">Best to shed some layers then, huh?</p><p dir="ltr">Before she even climbed out of the seat, she shed her sweater and tossed it haphazardly to the floorboard without a care in the world. Just like that, she was shirtless and climbing into the back, finding her way into Agatha’s lap with very little effort.</p><p dir="ltr">“You okay?” Rio asked through a grin as both of her hands landed on the sides of Agatha’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“Just fine. But I couldn’t wait.” It was almost a growl as her hands snaked up Rio’s back and worked free the clasp there.</p><p dir="ltr">That was just fucking fine with her.</p><p dir="ltr">She tossed her bra aside the moment it slid down her arms, nearly melting into Agatha the moment her mouth met the soft flesh of Rio’s breast, her hand raising to cup and knead at the other.</p><p dir="ltr">Damn.</p><p dir="ltr">All this for calling her ‘my love’ in public?</p><p dir="ltr">She’d have to do that shit <em>far</em> more often. They’d be bound to get arrested at that rate.</p><p dir="ltr">Worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">The more Agatha kissed and nibbled at her skin, the less control she had over the way her body moved. Her hips shifted downward, begging for any kind of friction as she worked them against Agatha’s lap, desperate for more.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re so hot,” she mewled, her one of her hands tangling easily in the hair on the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p dir="ltr">A delighted hum sounded from chest level as Agatha unhooked her teeth from Rio’s skin and flashed those dangerous blue eyes upward. At the same fucking time, her tongue rolled out and stiffened as she licked over Rio’s nipple, damn near causing her to bust right then and there.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuckfuckfuck.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t sure she’d ever been so fucking turned on in her life.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha,” she practically wheezed, pulling at her hair. “Agatha. I need you in me right fucking now.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was all teeth and dangerous shimmer in the blink of an eye.</p><p dir="ltr">“I was hoping you’d say that.”</p><p dir="ltr">They were both shifting around on the back seat with Agatha managing to help rid Rio of her jeans and cute little lace panties, seemingly unphased by the effort.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha wanted what she wanted.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t care about anything that stood in the way of her getting it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio settled against the door, squirming around to avoid the handle as one leg bent at the knee, her foot on the seat and the other dropped to land on the floor. The very moment she settled, Agatha was on the fucking prowl, surging forward to crush their mouths together at the very same time her hand dropped and her fingers parted to run heavy lines along the apex of Rio’s thighs, on either side of her wet and desperate cunt.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted to curse, to moan Agatha’s name, but little more came out than a moan that Agatha quickly ate up and swallowed, wasting no fucking time at all as her two middle fingers swiped between Rio’s folds, obviously gauging what it was she had caused.</p><p dir="ltr">“Mmmm, so wet,” Agatha half-managed into her mouth. Rio couldn’t argue, couldn’t offer a rebuttal and so she instead lifted her hips, begging for more with a weak whine.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s breath caught a little in her throat as she kissed Rio deeper, but she did what was being asked of her.</p><p dir="ltr">She pressed two fingers directly into Rio’s core, causing her to cry out in pleasure, her hands gripping at Agatha’s side and shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh fuck it felt so good.</p><p dir="ltr">It shouldn’t have felt so good to be fucked in the back of a car parked super close to a public fucking park, but Rio didn’t care. They were tucked away. No one would notice them.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, if she didn’t fucking scream her head off.</p><p dir="ltr">It was tempting, but neither of them needed to wind up in cuffs unless they were in Agatha’s bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, Agatha seemed to know the best way to keep her quiet was to keep her mouth occupied. She eagerly devoured every moan, every whimper, every cry as her fingers worked in and out of Rio’s body.</p><p dir="ltr">She could feel each curl, each press and pull. It was the most exhilarating feeling, to be hidden away from the world and swallowed by the absolute carnal desire that seemed to breed between them with no effort at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hips worked in time with Agatha’s thrusts, her tongue tasting every bit of Agatha’s mouth she could manage, but she knew the inevitable was closing in.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn’t want it to.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted it to last.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted <em>those very moments</em> to last.</p><p dir="ltr">Didn’t matter.</p><p dir="ltr">Body and brain both shouted very clearly: ABSOLUTELY NOT.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment she knew it was coming, that <em>she</em> was going to come, her lips pried from Agatha’s and her face snapped forward to land in Agatha’s shoulder, a much meatier part of her body that would better absorb the obscene sounds that sounded from the very pits of her lungs.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy hell.</p><p dir="ltr">That shouldn’t have been so hot, but it definitely was. As the pleasure washed and ebbed over Rio’s entire body, she crumpled against the door and gave a light tug on Agatha’s hair to draw her attention. She pulled back, but before Rio could direct her in for a kiss, she brought her hand up.</p><p dir="ltr">And sucked on her damn fingers.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuuuuuuuckkkkkkkk.</p><p dir="ltr">“Agatha,” Rio whined, but there was no room for her to voice anything else as Agatha closed the gap between them and kissed her, the sweet and salty taste of her own cum still on Agatha’s lips.</p><p dir="ltr">This woman would be the fucking death of her.</p><p dir="ltr">The kiss lingered a little longer before Rio pulled away, eyes flickering open to behold Agatha there above her.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re mine tonight, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sweeter words have never been spoken.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Their afternoon detour might have been an unexpected delight, but there was something in Rio’s brain that simply would not rest as they rode home with Agatha’s hand resting on her thigh.</p><p dir="ltr">Things were changing.</p><p dir="ltr">Without explicit direction or a need to facilitate, they were still changing. Maybe it would have done them both some good to sit down and have a frank and clear conversation about what they were, what they would label it, how they should operate outside of their covert work hours.</p><p dir="ltr">But <em>why?</em></p><p dir="ltr">Sure, communication was key, blah blah blah, but… Something about what tied them together was different. It wasn’t so much that they wouldn’t benefit from communication, it was more along the lines of everything about them just being so… <em>backwards</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">They were fucking before they knew each other. They became friends <em>because </em>they were fucking. They crossed personal boundaries because they were fucking <em>and </em>friends.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the feelings thing kinda happened along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">For every single instance Rio could have pointed to where she rationalized away Agatha’s actions as a platonic care, she now knew she was wrong. Maybe that was where it started, but Agatha was <em>way</em> past that point.</p><p dir="ltr">After all, she was the one who dropped the big ‘l’ bomb first.</p><p dir="ltr">She hadn’t done it again, maybe, but Rio had a feeling that would be short lived. There was no way she would have ever broken that kind of barrier without any sense of intention or comfort. Even if she didn’t <em>mean</em> to blurt it out, something in her told her she could and Rio wouldn’t run.</p><p dir="ltr">How could she run?</p><p dir="ltr">She’d already proven to herself that going more than two days cold turkey off of Agatha was a death sentence, even if she knew she would physically survive in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">The point still stood: being without Agatha sucked and was not something Rio wanted to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Especially by choice.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, they were still adults who needed to practice moderation and self-restraint to some degree, but there would never be a willful distance put between them if Rio could help it.</p><p dir="ltr">When she texted Agatha the night she went to the bar, she truly meant the last thing she said and she did her best to prove it.</p><p dir="ltr">She would be better, no matter what it took.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting by being the one to make them dinner (for her first time since they'd become friends) felt like a good jumping-off point.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a <em>little</em> difficult to stay on task, but mostly because Agatha had apparently not been sated from their little afternoon tryst. She hovered at first, just watching as Rio tossed things into a pan and sliced up mushrooms, but by the time she was in front of the stove, it evolved into Agatha behind her with her hands on Rio’s hips.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>That</em> escalated to her lips on the back of Rio’s head, her shoulder, her neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re going to make me burn the house down,” she observed, turning her head to brush against Agatha’s. Instead of pulling away or releasing her hold, Agatha kissed her ear instead.</p><p dir="ltr">That was Rio’s hot button.</p><p dir="ltr">And she knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Stopppp ittttt,” she whined, squirming in Agatha’s hold. “We gotta eat! And I have to impress you with the one dish I know how to make flawlessly.”</p><p dir="ltr">A soft laugh landed in her hair as Agatha squeezed her hips again.</p><p dir="ltr">God.</p><p dir="ltr">Was this what the future could look like?</p><p dir="ltr">Would Agatha want a future that could be so much of their present on repeat?</p><p dir="ltr">Would she want a future with Rio?</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was too soon to be spinning down that rabbit hole, but Rio stayed caught only for a minute before she was back in a reality she couldn’t get enough of.</p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, okay, Chef Rio. Work your magic.”</p><p dir="ltr">She was teasing and being a little shit, but Rio loved it. She loved that Agatha felt comfortable enough to stay close, to hassle her, and know with certainty it was well-received.</p><p dir="ltr">So with Agatha hanging onto her hips and watching every move she made – and occasionally nibbling on her neck – Rio finished their meal and plated it up, joining Agatha at the dining room table to eat.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit,” Agatha exclaimed after the first bite, her hand covering her mouth as she chewed. “You can cook like <em>this</em> and you’ve been letting me hog the stove?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio laughed as she rolled her eyes and finished her own bite. “Do not be fooled. This and spaghetti are the only two things I can make and not burn.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was honest, but seemed to tickle Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">“This is way more complex than spaghetti,” she pointed out before taking another bite.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes. Well. My mom taught me this one my senior year of high school to help me impress a girl. Good to know it still works twenty years later.”</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha looked at her, she could see an obvious mix of empathy and amusement; it was clearly serving its purpose, but she had a little more knowledge now to understand it was one of the few good memories Rio had left of her mother.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, thanks for using it to impress me.” She took another bite, her face cinching in thought. “But next time, use a little more salt.”</p><p dir="ltr">In an instant, they were both grinning and laughing, bright and joyous.</p><p dir="ltr">Life sucked sometimes. That was an inevitable fact.</p><p dir="ltr">But it didn’t have to suck all the time.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn’t suck when she was with Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, it was quite nice.</p><p dir="ltr">After finishing their dinners and pouring a hefty glass of wine for themselves, they relocated to the couch, sitting so close they were almost on top of one another. Rio took a sip of her wine as her eyes trained on the television across the room, thoughts clearly beginning to percolate in that head of hers.</p><p dir="ltr">“What?” Agatha asked with a light nudge and a gentle smile that didn’t quite make it to her eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">“Huh?” Rio returned, snapping out of the trance-like state she’d been in.</p><p dir="ltr">“What are you thinking about? Is it about tonight?”</p><p dir="ltr">Damn. Was she that easy to read?</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah. I think we should just… be us again. And not think about it beforehand. Like… plan it out, I mean.” She knew she was rambling, but Agatha simply smiled at her, seemingly reading her mind.</p><p dir="ltr">But of course she had to give her shit about it.</p><p dir="ltr">“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were trying to make it… <em>romantic.</em>”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio rolled her eyes, giving Agatha a light push. “No!”</p><p dir="ltr">Okay… maybe.</p><p dir="ltr">“Uhuh, sure,” Agatha goaded just before she finished her wine. She set the glass down and leaned right back into her spot, heavy as she let her weight sink against Rio’s side. One of her hands snaked its way over her thigh, squeezing lightly. “I think it’s… cute.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Cute? Nothing I do is <em>cute</em>,” Rio tried to argue, but it didn’t matter. “We just need to make it worth the thousand dollars in tips, you know.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Two.”</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha interjected, Rio stopped herself short as her jaw snapped shut and she turned confused eyes toward Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">“What?” she asked, clearly jarred and confused.</p><p dir="ltr">“Two thousand dollars in tips. Two more people tipped as well.”</p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy fucking shit.</p><p dir="ltr">No wonder Agatha went full panic mode. They hit 5k in less than a month and two grand of it came in less than a week.</p><p dir="ltr">It didn’t feel real. It didn’t feel like it was possible to go about things legally and make that kind of bank just by doing what she was already going to be doing, which was fucking the beautiful, charismatic, funny, charming woman that was Agatha Harkness.</p><p dir="ltr">“When– I– But–?”</p><p dir="ltr">“It happened over the weekend. Obviously, it kind of slipped my mind to tell you.”</p><p dir="ltr">What did Rio even say to that?</p><p dir="ltr">She said nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">She kissed Agatha instead.</p><p dir="ltr">And then she said something she wasn’t sure she should say, but said anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">“I love you.”</p><p dir="ltr">The grin she felt against her lips was instantaneous and full, a soft sigh breathed through it – in relief? – and Agatha kissed her again, her hands cradling both sides of Rio’s jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">“I love you too.”</p><p dir="ltr">Their lips met and brushed, but barely parted before Rio pulled away, gaze flickering to life as it met Agatha’s.</p><p dir="ltr">“Shall we go upstairs?”</p><p dir="ltr">“I think we shall.”</p><p dir="ltr">She let Agatha take her by the hand, let her lead her up the stairs and down the hall to the bedroom. She let her take her clothes off one garment at a time, kissing over her skin with each removal. It was so light, so… dare she say it… intimate. The way Agatha was touching her, it was intentional, like it mattered.</p><p dir="ltr">So she gave the same thing right back.</p><p dir="ltr">She was careful but deliberate in the way she peeled Agatha’s sweater and camisole over her head, tossing it toward the dresser but not actually caring where it landed. Her hands fell to Agatha’s warm sides, their lips meeting in another unhurried, undemanding kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a different kind of energy, a slightly softer charge that buzzed and hummed around them, and Rio could not seem to get enough of it. She ate up every brush of their lips, every kiss on skin, every piece of clothing shed. By the time they were both bare from head to toe, hands on hips and sides and gripping close, Rio was sure she could practically gorge herself on the sentimentality and never get sick of it.</p><p dir="ltr">But they had a job to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Kind of.</p><p dir="ltr">Was it really considered work if you enjoyed it?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio placed another quick peck to Agatha’s lips before untangling and stepping away, heading for the dresser. “Get comfortable,” she offered over her shoulder, as if she were not speaking to the woman whose house they were occupying. She paid no mind to the way Agatha rolled her eyes and placed herself on the bed, instead focusing on the sole act of climbing into her harness.</p><p dir="ltr">After sliding the dildo through the o-ring and tightening the straps, she turned around to the sight of Agatha on her feet in the middle of the bed, fully extended as she adjusted the ceiling-mounted camera, angling it toward the headboard. Satisfied, she hopped down and moved the two on tripods accordingly, seemingly already knowing at least a bit of what she wanted out of the interaction.</p><p dir="ltr">With the lights dim and Rio fully prepared for what came next, she could do little more than smile at the woman before her, propped up against the headboard.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled back, but only for a second before she raised and crooked a finger, beckoning Rio forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Like she was in a trance, Rio listened.</p><p dir="ltr">Her focus never once deviated from Agatha, from her hair as it flowed down over her breasts to the way her legs parted, as if begging Rio to come closer. She looked so fucking good it almost hurt, but Rio wanted more.</p><p dir="ltr">She wanted whatever Agatha was willing to give.</p><p dir="ltr">Mindless of the cameras, Rio crawled forward on the bed, placing herself between Agatha’s thighs on her knees with an eager yet knowing grin on her face. She wasn’t sure how she was the one so fucking lucky as to be making a sensual porn video with Agatha, but there was never a moment before and never would be one to come where she wasn’t grateful.</p><p dir="ltr">A tentative hand raised, cupping Agatha by the cheek as Rio pulled her forward, pressing their lips together in a kiss that decried her hesitance and embraced feeling instead. It was measured at first, but her self-restraint slipped quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Her free hand found Agatha’s chest, cupping and gripping at her breast in desperation before it began to wander, fingertips grazing over her abs as they dropped lower and lower still. The moment they skated through the coarse and trimmed hair between Agatha’s legs, she adjusted her own slightly for the view of the camera behind her. It wasn’t a conscious thought, but it would benefit them regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">Her fingers danced lower, pressing past Agatha’s lips to find the wet heat of her desire. Agatha sucked in a quick breath against Rio’s lips, releasing it a second later in the most delicious whimper.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>God. She was so fucking hot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It was one of the only thoughts rattling around in Rio’s brain.</p><p dir="ltr">The other?</p><p dir="ltr"><em>God, I fucking love her.</em></p><p dir="ltr">At least it was okay to be in deep at that point.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio hummed, clearly pleased, but then she did something unexpected. Something Agatha immediately did not like.</p><p dir="ltr">She moved away and sat next to Agatha on the bed. Her head turned, she grinned, and gently tipped it toward her lap.</p><p dir="ltr">“Come here, my love.”</p><p dir="ltr">There was a crackling of light in Agatha’s eyes and her lips parted in a devious grin, clearly understanding what Rio <em>wasn’t</em> saying.</p><p dir="ltr">For as much as it was just them, in the moment, there was still the quiet understanding that they were putting on a show, so that was exactly what Rio wanted to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Without a word, Agatha shifted on the bed and lobbed a knee over Rio’s thighs, happily hovering over her lap with a smirk on her lips. “Naughty,” she muttered, probably too softly to be picked up by the microphones.</p><p dir="ltr">With her hands on Agatha’s hips, all Rio could do was grin.</p><p dir="ltr">“Want some help?” she teased softly, letting go to reach for the silicone cock between her legs, lining it up perfectly with Agatha’s entrance. As Agatha placed one hand on Rio’s shoulder, she sank down and tilted her head back, moaning at the pleasure of the immediate stretch and fill.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>So. Fucking. Hot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Rio leaned forward, her face pressing to Agatha’s chest as she began to kiss and nip and lick and suck at every available inch of breast and chest and shoulder she could reach. It was like an endless buffet where Rio could never get her fill. She could feel, her hand on Agatha’s hip, as Agatha worked downward, taking her little by little as those delicious noises continued to slip out of her.</p><p dir="ltr">With a gentle push, she felt Agatha settle against her, rocking slightly as her hand snapped up to grip at Rio’s hair in encouragement.</p><p dir="ltr">She took it.</p><p dir="ltr">She sank her teeth into Agatha’s skin, laved over it with her tongue. She kissed and sucked to the point of bruising, unapologetic in this woman who so clearly wanted to be hers. It was frantic but driven, needy but thought-out.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, her hips began to shift and work as she leaned into Rio, pressing her against the headboard. Every stroke, every languid pull of her cunt over the length of the dildo inside her body was precise, meant to be a feast for the eyes. Even from where she sat, it was quite the feast for Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hands slid and gripped and pulled at Agatha’s body, her breasts, her hips, her sides, and ass. She was growing more and more desperate the faster Agatha’s pace became and it clearly showed.</p><p dir="ltr">Ravenous lips latched onto her neck as Agatha lunged forward, caught by Rio’s strong arms as she continued sliding up and down in her haze of lust. The more her hands and nails dug into Rio’s skin, however, the closer Rio knew she was getting to tipping Agatha right over that sought-after edge.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as she pulled away to place a hot, needy kiss on Agatha’s lips, she was thrown slightly when Agatha jerked back as she came, her body arching perfectly over Rio’s legs as it twitched and convulsed, her legs shaking in an attempt to close, but finding no success.</p><p dir="ltr">Almost instinctively, Rio leaned forward, her head dropping to place kisses along Agatha’s torso as she rode out each and every last wave of her pleasure, heaving and moaning all the while.</p><p dir="ltr">God.</p><p dir="ltr">It was fucking glorious.</p><p dir="ltr">It was <em>so </em>fucking glorious that Rio didn’t even care about how intimate it was or how they weren't wearing their masks.</p><p dir="ltr">It was just her and Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Doing what they did best.</p><p dir="ltr">And fuck if they weren’t good at it.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p dir="ltr">Before the sun even touched the horizon Sunday morning, Rio was awake.</p><p dir="ltr">At first, it felt like one of those instances where she would most likely go back to sleep a few minutes later. Unfortunately for her, her brain woke up too soon.</p><p dir="ltr">She realized where she was, what bed she was laying in, and that the woman she loved was still next to her, fast asleep. The sound of her breathing was soft and slow, sometimes a grumble but never a snore, and even in the dark…</p><p dir="ltr">She looked happy.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot had changed in only a week, but nothing about the changes felt wrong or out of line. Of anything, Rio was starting to actually put stock in the idea that maybe, just maybe, her future could look a lot different.</p><p dir="ltr">It could have Agatha in it.</p><p dir="ltr">That would be a future worth experiencing, she thought.</p><p dir="ltr">While it would benefit them both to have a frank conversation about the state of their relationship, there was enough peace to be found in their nameless union that, quite honestly, Rio was fine with.</p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, yeah, labels and relationships and serious conversations were great and all, but in her life, Rio never really had the chance to live in the moment. Being granted it after thirty odd years, she didn't want to waste it.</p><p dir="ltr">If they were happy, that was what mattered most.</p><p dir="ltr">She laid quietly still on her side for what felt like a short eternity, just basking in the warmth of knowing her place in the world was next to Agatha (at least for the time being). When she realized she was absolutely not going to fall back asleep, she carefully climbed out of bed, pulled on a shirt and a pair of underwear, and made her way downstairs.</p><p dir="ltr">Lucky for her as she made coffee, the kitchen window faced east and allowed for a morning show.</p><p dir="ltr">The sunrise was beautiful that morning, navies washing into oranges, fractus clods dotting the sky after the overnight rain.</p><p dir="ltr">It was so stunning, so beautiful that she <em>almost</em> wanted to run up the stairs and wake Agatha so they could share the sight together, but she didn't. It was silly, especially to wake someone up out of a dead sleep when there would be a million other chances in their lifetime. (Okay, maybe not a million, but it was far too early for her to try and do the math.)</p><p dir="ltr">The pot of coffee brewed in its entirety, leaving her patient as she watched the sun’s ascent. When it finished, she poured herself a cup and relocated to the living room, pulling out her laptop and unceremoniously settling into the couch.</p><p dir="ltr">It took her two minutes to type in a Google search she had no business typing in.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, just as she probably should <em>not</em> have done, she looked through websites belonging to a couple of different monument companies, trying to figure out what the best option would be.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t her place, maybe, but she promised Agatha she would help. With it being something she’d done a time or three, it was almost a natural process for her. For Agatha, it was likely new. Judging by the way she spoke about her mother, that lady probably didn’t have a headstone either, if even a grave.</p><p dir="ltr">For an hour, Rio researched. She knew that prices probably weren’t of any concern, but certain stone cutters often tried to upsell on basic items and if they could avoid Agatha being ripped off, it was probably best to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Not for Agatha’s sake.</p><p dir="ltr">For the sake of whoever pissed her off with that bullshit.</p><p dir="ltr">Though, Rio would admit that she’d pay good money to see Agatha grab a man up by the collar of his shirt and ask him who the fuck he thought he was to try and swindle a grieving mother. She wasn’t sure <em>why</em> she thought Agatha might do something of the sort, but it felt very possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Absorbed in the screen of her laptop, Rio’s other senses dulled, including her hearing.</p><p dir="ltr">She only realized this when she felt a pair of hands land on her shoulders, squeezing lightly before Agatha placed a light kiss on the top of her head. She still did it even though she could clearly see what Rio was looking at.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sorry,” she grumbled, caught and embarrassed.</p><p dir="ltr">“For?” It was too sweet, but mostly because Agatha’s voice was still heavy with sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">“Overstepping again.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha squeezed her shoulders again before letting go of one, replacing it with her chin a second later as she tipped her head to lean against Rio’s.</p><p dir="ltr">“You offered. And we both know I won’t willingly bring it up. So don’t apologize.”</p><p dir="ltr">The way she said it, she sounded so fucking sincere it almost pained Rio to hear it. This woman had struggled with so much guilt and self-resentment that it kept her from giving her son a proper resting place. But Rio didn’t want her to struggle with it anymore. She wasn’t being fair to herself; she deserved peace.</p><p dir="ltr">If accomplishing something she’d put off for years could help with that, Rio was going to jump at the opportunity to assist.</p><p dir="ltr">“I just wanted to help,” Rio admitted in earnest, tipping her head back to take Agatha in, albeit upside-down. “And… Well… I’ve done this a few times. So I know what to do, I guess.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned forward, kissing her Spider-Man style with a soft but sad laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">“At least I have the expert at my disposal,” she teased, kissing Rio again before she stood and meandered toward the kitchen to make her own coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">A few minutes later, she placed herself in the spot directly next to Rio. For forty-five minutes, they went over sizes and shapes, colors and adornments. The last thing left to do was to place an inscription.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing it was the hardest part and should come directly from the source, Rio gently lifted up the laptop and placed it atop Agatha’s thighs.</p><p dir="ltr">“It should be you. I don’t want to make you say it out loud if you don’t want to.”</p><p dir="ltr">For the longest moment, Agatha simply sat still. She didn’t raise her hands to the keyboard, did not turn her head, barely even blinked. Rio knew it was the weight of the moment, the heaviness of what was being asked for her, so she remained patient.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, Agatha’s head turned and the hand closest to Rio raised, cupping her cheek lightly. Without saying anything, Agatha leaned forward and pressed their lips together, soft and slow. There was little pressure, in both the intention and the physical act itself, but Rio could feel every bit of appreciation Agatha was pouring into her.</p><p dir="ltr">It was nice.</p><p dir="ltr">But it also made her heart squeeze within its cage of ribs.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha broke the kiss, Rio’s eyes opened, but those beautiful blues did not.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you,” she whispered against Rio’s lips, finally opening her eyes to reveal pools of raw emotion.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>God, even in her pain, she was so stunningly beautiful.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Maybe it was an inappropriate thought, but it was an honest one.</p><p dir="ltr">“Any time,” Rio half-joked with a small smile.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha turned back to the laptop and took a deep breath, readying herself to finally do something she’d been putting off for any and all reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Silently, Rio dropped a hand to rest on the top of her thigh, giving a light squeeze of encouragement. She cast her eyes toward the black screen of the off television, allowing Agatha privacy while still not taking away her support.</p><p dir="ltr">After a minute, the soft sound of keys clacking sounded from Agatha’s lap and the smallest smile pulled on Rio’s lips.</p><p dir="ltr">She was honestly pretty fucking proud.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, how far they’d come in five months.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a beautiful thing, really.</p><p dir="ltr">And it made Rio really fucking happy.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was helping her accomplish her goals; it was only right of her to return the favor.</p><p dir="ltr">There was a pause in the noise, almost drawing Rio’s attention to the point of looking over to check on Agatha, but before she looked over, there was one final tap before she exhaled a sigh and sank into the comfort of the couch.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s done.”</p><p dir="ltr">There it was again, that overwhelming surge of pride that felt too big for where they actually were.</p><p dir="ltr">Grief was hard. Moving on was harder.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was finally taking the steps to free herself from the shackles of guilt in regards to her son’s death.</p><p dir="ltr">That was big.</p><p dir="ltr">It was huge.</p><p dir="ltr">So maybe it wasn’t <em>so</em> misplaced for Rio to be so fucking proud of her.</p><p dir="ltr">In spite of the brightness of the emotion itself, she kept her exterior subdued as she reached up and cradled Agatha’s jaw, her thumb brushing lovingly over her cheek.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m very proud of you. And I know it’s half the fight so… I’m still here. And we will go together when it’s set. I meant that.” Maybe she didn’t <em>need</em> to repeat herself, but it couldn’t hurt to make sure Agatha really <em>heard</em> her when she said it.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did not get emotional or glassy-eyed, but a gentle curve of her lips blossomed and her expression softened.</p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you. I know it probably brought up some un-fun memories, but… It… It felt doable with you here. And I don’t know if I ever could have done it alone. I know it seems stupid, but–”</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey, Agatha, no,” Rio cut in, reaching for her hand with the one not cupping her cheek. “Loss is hard. Dealing with it sucks, so… You just did what you needed to to get by. I don’t blame you for that and you shouldn’t blame yourself either.”</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t exactly therapy-level advice, but Rio was a fucking bio major, not a psych one. She was trying her best, though, because Agatha was worthy of that much.</p><p dir="ltr">“But it’s done now,” Agatha offered, leaning toward Rio to give her a soft kiss. “Well. Mostly done. You know what I mean.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I do.”</p><p dir="ltr">When Rio left for class Monday morning, she told herself she needed to behave and limit her time spent at Agatha’s. With things feeling so new and fresh between them, even with the monumental steps they’d made, she thought it best to give them time to breathe.</p><p dir="ltr">That lasted all of twelve hours until Agatha called her Monday night and asked her to come over.</p><p dir="ltr">She wasn’t weak by any means, but telling Agatha ‘no’ and meaning it felt like an impossible feat.</p><p dir="ltr">So Rio said yes.</p><p dir="ltr">And she said yes Tuesday night, and Wednesday night. She even said yes after a group project that ran late Thursday night. By Friday night, they were back to their regularly scheduled programming.</p><p dir="ltr">And so went the following week as well, nights spent at Agatha and the weekend spent filming.</p><p dir="ltr">When they crossed the eight thousand dollar mark, Rio simply quit asking for updates.</p><p dir="ltr">She was going to be able to pay for her degree, there was absolutely no question about it.</p><p dir="ltr">By Thursday the following week, Agatha got the call.</p><p dir="ltr">Saturday, they went to the cemetery.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio was insistent on the way that they stop at a florist so she could properly pay her respects. Agatha did not cry, at least while Rio was in the car, but she did pull her in for a kiss and whisper words of gratitude before letting her go.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment they were both out of the car, they could easily see the two men finishing up the base the stone would be laid into, causing Agatha to stop in place. Quietly and knowingly, Rio stepped up to her side and took hold of her hand, giving it a tight squeeze.</p><p dir="ltr">“You can do it. I’m right here.”</p><p dir="ltr">Obvious maybe, but clearly helpful as she felt Agatha relax the tiniest bit beside her. She inhaled slowly through her nose and took a step forward, Rio right by her side.</p><p dir="ltr">Painful, maybe, but she was soldiering on.</p><p dir="ltr">The small marker had been removed and as they approached, the men offered kind smiles and asked if she was ready. Silently, Agatha gave a nod. The moment they both moved to lift the stone out of the back of the truck to set it, Rio could feel as every one of her knuckles collided, forced together by the strength of Agatha’s grip.</p><p dir="ltr">It fucking hurt, but it was worth it to take on some of what Agatha was feeling right then.</p><p dir="ltr">She still did not cry, though her eyes were clearly wet from the way they were stinging. Even as the men finished and bowed their heads in respect, she still did not offer a shred of emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio knew why.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was not going to fall apart in front of strangers.</p><p dir="ltr">Hell, she wasn’t even convinced she would fall apart in front of Rio, at least not out in public.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment the truck drove off and the two of them were left alone, Agatha released her death-grip on Rio’s hand and knelt in front of it. Taking the cue, Rio did the same, sinking to her knees in the grass beside the woman she loved.</p><p dir="ltr">There, before them, was Nicky’s headstone.</p><p dir="ltr">NICHOLAS “NICKY” HARKNESS.<br/>2018-2022</p><p dir="ltr">TREASURED SON.<br/>NEVER FORGOTTEN. LOVED ALWAYS.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment it registered, Rio’s eyes pricked with tears, the emotion welling in her throat before she could even attempt to stop it.</p><p dir="ltr">She couldn’t cry.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha wasn’t going to cry, she sure as fuck couldn’t cry.</p><p dir="ltr">Quietly, Rio reached forward and laid the bouquet she purchased across the corner of the headstone, sitting back on her knees as she glanced at Agatha at her side. She was moving, reaching into her pocket for something she concealed in her hand. When she raised it, her fingers unfurled and a little green soldier laid flat on its back in her palm.</p><p dir="ltr">Across the bottom in uneven letters (clearly written by a child) was the word MOM.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha did not look at her, did not reach out for her. She simply leaned forward and stood the soldier upright near the top of the stone, sniffling softly.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m always on patrol, my boy,” she whispered, sinking back to her knees.</p><p dir="ltr">Immediately, she sagged to the side, leaning into Rio who was quick to wrap an arm around her, holding her close.</p><p dir="ltr">For a while, they sat close and silent, simply paying their respects and allowing Agatha the time she needed to fully feel her grief. Although she wasn’t sure how much time had passed, it had been over an hour since they arrived and Rio was beginning to wonder if she was going to have to coax Agatha to go home.</p><p dir="ltr">Before the thought came to fruition, Agatha pulled away and slowly climbed to her feet, offering her hand to Rio to pull her up as well. Before they set off, she was wrapped in Agatha’s strong arms and pulled in for a tight embrace.</p><p dir="ltr">They didn’t speak; they didn’t really have to. It was a silent understanding as they climbed into the car and headed back to Agatha’s to unwind for the rest of the day. After shoes were off and they ascended the stairs to change into more comfortable house wear, Agatha took her by the hand and pulled her close.</p><p dir="ltr">“Will you take a nap with me?” she asked softly, placing a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled, her eyes softening.</p><p dir="ltr">“I would very much like to take a nap with you, my love,” Rio told her, returning a kiss to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p dir="ltr">Per their usual routine, they slipped into bed and met in the center, tangling easily and wrapping snugly around one another.</p><p dir="ltr">Cutting through the silence, Agatha’s whisper landed warmly in Rio’s ears.</p><p dir="ltr">“I love you, Rio Vidal.”</p><p dir="ltr">She smiled, her eyes still closed.</p><p dir="ltr">“And I love you too, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p> </p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Six months later.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Jaime Vasquez, M.S in Environmental Science.”</p><p dir="ltr">One of the worst things about having a last name that started with the letter ‘v’ was always winding up at the end of every fucking list that went by alphabetical order. Even worse was being in a program that was featured more toward the ass end of the ceremony <em>and</em> having a last name that started with the letter ‘v.’</p><p dir="ltr">But, sixty five minutes into proceedings, Rio Vidal <em>finally</em> got what it was she’d been waiting for for six very, very long years.</p><p dir="ltr">“Rio Vidal, M.S. in Biological Science.”</p><p dir="ltr">Up to that point, Rio was pretty much completely outside of her body, but hearing her name, she knew she had to move. In her cap and gown, corded and with a bright grin on her face, she strode across the stage and accepted her degree as if it were the most precious thing she’d held in her life.</p><p dir="ltr">It was like being on auto-pilot to shake the Dean’s hand, to thank her for everything, and to walk off stage with the full understanding that she’d achieved each and every one of the dreams she’d had over the last six years.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been an uphill struggle most days and more often than she wanted to admit, she considered giving up, but she was ultimately thankful she never had.</p><p dir="ltr">If she were going to place her gratitude anywhere, however, it could only go one place.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s eyes cast toward the stands as she made her way back to her seat, beaming the moment they landed on a wild mane of hair blowing in the wind, a pair of sunglasses, and a bright grin that was unmistakably proud.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">When they met at the beginning of the school year, Rio never could have known what her life would become. She never could have predicted that they would make twenty grand in less than a year simply by making fucking porn.</p><p dir="ltr">That was a thought, wasn’t it?</p><p dir="ltr">One that, honestly, never would have crossed her mind if Agatha hadn’t crossed her path first.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, they could have stopped at the point of paying off her tuition, but…</p><p dir="ltr">Honestly, they had fun.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a good time, and it was a way to make money without actually having to <em>work</em> for it. Sure, there was work <em>put in</em>, but it wasn’t agonizing labor or menially important and repetitive by any means.</p><p dir="ltr">It was something Rio would have done every single day anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Which was probably why Agatha asked her two weeks prior to graduation to move in.</p><p dir="ltr">That and, you know, they kind of loved each other. An embarrassingly stupid amount.</p><p dir="ltr">To the point where even Rio sometimes grossed herself out.</p><p dir="ltr">It was almost embarrassing in the kind of way where no one else has any idea, but you do, and you’re still embarrassed anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Passing thirty those years ago and knowing what she wanted to do with her life, Rio resigned the idea of love to being something more along the lines of a fantasy for those who had time to indulge. She convinced herself she could not maintain a personal life <em>and</em> get through school at the same time, but she’d managed it all the same.</p><p dir="ltr">Because of Agatha.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha fucking Harkness.</p><p dir="ltr">What a goddamn woman.</p><p dir="ltr">She ran her Etsy shop from her couch wearing only her robe, she was a <em>mean </em>cook, and she’d since started to teach herself how to throw food and catch it in her mouth because she was jealous Rio could and she couldn’t.</p><p dir="ltr">What was not to love?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha <em>chose</em> isolation because it was safe. She barked at children and threw cutting glances at their parents because she didn’t necessarily want people to like her, to try and get to know her.</p><p dir="ltr">Having made an exception for Rio, it was clear it would likely never happen again.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>“I got all I needed out of the world. I’m good to become an official hermit now.”</em></p><p dir="ltr">She said it one night in bed, playing with Rio’s hair as they laid tangled and slightly sweaty at two in the morning.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t direct, but Rio heard what she was saying.</p><p dir="ltr">She held the door to the most vulnerable part of her open long enough for Rio to slip through and the moment she did, it was sealed again, forever.</p><p dir="ltr">As the ceremony drew to a close and hundreds of caps soared into the air, Rio’s heart was practically beating out of her chest. The way she practically sprinted for Agatha and leapt into her arms probably did very little to help it.</p><p dir="ltr">“You did it!” Agatha exclaimed, burying her face in Rio’s hair as she spun her around before dropping her to her feet. “I’m so proud of you. And I know your family is, too.”</p><p dir="ltr">They both knew she shouldn’t have said that in front of hundreds of other people, but instead of bothering to be upset, Rio’s arms squeezed tighter around Agatha’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a heavy sentiment, but she knew Agatha was telling her what she deserved to hear. And she was the only person who could, the only one with that particular ability.</p><p dir="ltr">So instead of letting the grief creep back in, she replaced it with gratitude instead.</p><p dir="ltr">After a moment, Rio head lifted and she found herself eye-to-eye with the woman she loved, a bewildered grin on her face.</p><p dir="ltr">“<em>We</em> did it,” Rio corrected, leaning toward her for a quick kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, that’s so cliché,” Agatha mused; Rio couldn’t actually <em>see </em>her eyes, but she was quite certain they rolled.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m serious,” she reiterated, lightly poking a finger into the back of Agatha’s ribs. “Meeting you is the only reason I’m standing here no worse for wear. I love you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was smiling, sharp but sincere, as her hands raised and wrapped in the green and gold cords draped around Rio’s neck. With a soft tug on the, she took a kiss of her own; one at first, then two more.</p><p dir="ltr">“I love you too. But remember this moment when you’re pulling your hair out on the job hunt,” Agatha teased, silencing her with one more kiss. When she righted herself, she was wearing this… <em>look</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio couldn’t see her eyes, but she didn’t need to.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was up to something in that brain of hers. She just knew it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Something on your mind?” she questioned, keeping close despite Agatha’s hold on her cords loosening.</p><p dir="ltr">“I think I came up with a good use for these.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Ohhhhhhhhhhh.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Shittttttttt.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“Is that so?” Rio asked with a smirk. “Do tell.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Nah,” came Agatha’s immediate response. “I’m so much better at the show part than the tell one.” She grinned, running the tip of her finger up Rio’s neck to beneath her chin. “Let’s go home.”</p><p dir="ltr">She didn't have to tell Rio twice.</p><p dir="ltr">The ride home was rather quiet, but mostly because Rio was a little too preoccupied by the feeling of accomplishment to consider much else.</p><p dir="ltr">It had taken her six years of her life after seven years of healing from six years of loss and pain, but she did it.</p><p dir="ltr">She really fucking did it.</p><p dir="ltr">And it felt amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">It felt even more amazing the two times Agatha felt the need to reassert how proud she was.</p><p dir="ltr">That was nice. Really nice.</p><p dir="ltr">For every insurance where Rio considered she would manage it all alone, she was really fucking thankful to have Agatha by her side. Maybe some things <em>were</em> worth changing for.</p><p dir="ltr">Walking into the house, Rio couldn't help the surprised yelp that left her when she passed inside before Agatha, who was holding the door, and felt a sharp smack to her ass.</p><p dir="ltr">“Hey!” she cried through a fit of giggles. “I know this gown is like… super sexy, but try to contain yourself until I can take it off.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You mean <em>I </em>can't take it off?” Agatha quipped, shutting the door and wearing a grin all the while. As she turned to follow through, she was met with empty space. Her lips dropped at the corners as her head snapped up.</p><p dir="ltr">And there Rio was, dancing her way to the stairs, hand on the zipper of her gown as she took them two at a time.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment Agatha took off after her, she bolted for the top, nearly tripping as she turned into the hallway, laughing like a complete idiot. By the time Agatha made it to the bedroom, Rio was already in the process of tossing the gown to the side, left in only what was beneath it.</p><p dir="ltr">Which… unbeknownst to Agatha until that moment was only a lace bra and a matching thong.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy shit,” she breathed, eyes wide and cheeks pink. “You wore <em>that</em> to graduation?! And nothing else?!”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">“And these, of course,” she offered, holding up the cords with a smirk.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ah, yes. <em>Of course</em>,” Agatha cooed, stepping forward as her hands slid into place on Rio’s waist. She pulled her close, planting a heavy but rich kiss right across Rio’s lips. “You are so hot. Smart and hot,” she murmured, taking another kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">“Good to know I did something right,” she managed back between the meetings of their mouths.</p><p dir="ltr">“You did.” Agatha's lips tore away, but only to press to the side of her neck. “So much so that I think you deserve to be rewarded. “</p><p dir="ltr">Oh?</p><p dir="ltr">Was that so?</p><p dir="ltr">“And what might my reward be?” Rio hummed softly, closing her eyes as Agatha kissed lower down her chest. When she pulled away and stepped back, Rio almost looked offended.</p><p dir="ltr">“Get undressed and you'll find out.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was way fucking hotter than it should have been.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio wasn’t typically one for surprises, but on that day of all days, perhaps she could make an exception. She stole one more quick kiss, watching after Agatha as she ventured to the dresser, hid whatever she grabbed, and retreated to the bathroom.</p><p dir="ltr">What was she up to?</p><p dir="ltr">Only one way to find out.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio heeded the instruction and stripped down, grabbing the lube from Agatha’s bedside table before she tossed it to the mattress and crawled onto the bed. She propped herself against the pillows and toyed with one of the cords – the gold one – while she waited.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha emerged, Rio’s mouth fell open.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh God.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>OhGodohGodohGod.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>She was wearing the double ringed harness</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Did it look a little silly seeing two silicone cocks hanging from between Agatha’s legs?</p><p dir="ltr">Well, yes, but the sudden realization of what she was about to do with them was enough to drown out any humor.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, she felt like she'd been kicked between the legs.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy fuck,” she breathed, wide-eyed as she bit at her finger. She could hardly tear her eyes away from Agatha’s hips, half certain she was already leaking into the sheets. “That… You… Jesus Christ, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">For as proud of Rio as she looked most of the day, right then she looked pretty damn proud of herself.</p><p dir="ltr">“Happy graduation?” Agatha asked with a smirk on her face and a squeak in her voice.</p><p dir="ltr">In no mood to wait, Rio scooted forward toward the edge of the bed as Agatha stepped closer to meet her there, settling between Rio’s knees. A hand raised, cupping her jaw with pressure to tilt her head back.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment their eyes met, Rio saw something different.</p><p dir="ltr">There was pride there, yes, but it was mixed heavily with something else. Something like want, desire.</p><p dir="ltr">“Happy graduation to me,” Rio murmured, already prepared for the heavy, warm kiss Agatha immediately laid on her lips.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn’t rushed in the least, but Rio could feel the heat, the way Agatha was practically burning up from everything she was feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">Never before had Rio ever known what it was like to be wanted so, so badly. Now, with Agatha, it was impossible to forget.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s lips parted and the tip of her tongue snaked up, begging for entrance. When Agatha gave it to her, her knees squeezed Agatha’s hips and their tongues met in full passion.</p><p dir="ltr">No masks. No camera.</p><p dir="ltr">Just Rio and the woman she loved indulging in the thing that brought them together, the thing that kept them as physically close as they could possibly be.</p><p dir="ltr">Her hands wandered Agatha’s sides, snuck around to her chest, gripping and pinching and pulling as if to press every button Agatha had.</p><p dir="ltr">And it was working.</p><p dir="ltr">She could tell by the way Agatha kissed her deeper, harder. She could tell by the way their tongues pressed and wrestled and rubbed. She could tell by the way Agatha’s hand slid into her hair and pulled.</p><p dir="ltr">When she adjusted slightly, Rio’s fog-filled brain didn’t quite catch it until Agatha abruptly broke the kiss and stood to full height, raising her hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Which had the gold cord in it.</p><p dir="ltr">“And what are you planning to do with that?” Rio asked, a little breathless.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha smirked.</p><p dir="ltr">“I’ve got a use for each of them.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh? Do tell.” Rio raised an inquisitive brow, urging her on.</p><p dir="ltr">“Well, this one? I think it would look very cute around your wrists. That way when I have you on your knees, taking all of me, you can’t even hold yourself up.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her voice was rich and smooth, almost like a purr, but that wasn’t really what Rio was focused on.</p><p dir="ltr">Nope.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, she was imagining herself with her face pressed into the mattress and Agatha fucking her senseless.</p><p dir="ltr">When she shifted and felt the wet sheet beneath her, she knew she was already done for.</p><p dir="ltr">“And the green one?”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, that wasn’t a smirk Agatha was wearing.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a voracious grin.</p><p dir="ltr">“You always look so good in green,” Agatha cooed in return, reaching to pick up the other cord to drape it around Rio’s neck. “Might make a pretty necklace.”</p><p dir="ltr">Oh hooooooly fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Bound and collared with her fucking graduation cords?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s life was fucking perfect.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha was fucking perfect.</p><p dir="ltr">What on earth had she done to deserve either?</p><p dir="ltr">“Let’s find out.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio stood and wrapped an arm around Agatha’s neck, kissing her as though it was her last day on earth.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha fucked her proper, it just might be.</p><p dir="ltr">She turned and climbed onto the bed again, on her knees and facing the headboard as the mattress sank behind her with Agatha’s weight.</p><p dir="ltr">It took her only a minute or two to properly and firmly secure Rio’s wrists together, checking for tightness and circulation. It probably wouldn’t have taken her as long if she could have stopped herself from kissing Rio’s neck and shoulders in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">Once finished with her hands, Agatha scooted closer, pressing her body to Rio’s back the bed she could.</p><p dir="ltr">The way she felt the silicone swing slightly, brushing against the inside of her thigh caused her to whimper, her ass arching out to beg for more. Agatha’s hands canvassed her front, sliding over her ribs to grip at her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">“You already look so good like this,” Agatha whispered in her ear, biting it another later.</p><p dir="ltr">Another whimper. A moan.</p><p dir="ltr">“Sound so good, too.”</p><p dir="ltr">One of her hands left Rio’s body and reached to the side, grabbing for the cord she then used to fasten around Rio’s neck. It took her only a moment, but when she was done, she gave Rio’s bare ass a light smack.</p><p dir="ltr">“Perfect.”</p><p dir="ltr">Even in her teenage years, no one had ever called Rio 'perfect.’ And it was surely not how she saw herself.</p><p dir="ltr">But when Agatha said it, she believed her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha kissed her cheek one last time and placed a gentle hand between her shoulder blades.</p><p dir="ltr">“Down,” she urged, her voice thick with lust.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio listened with a whine, lowering her torso to the bed, her cheek pressed against the soft jersey sheet.</p><p dir="ltr">She was now at Agatha’s mercy, and there was nowhere else she wanted to be.</p><p dir="ltr">Not a second later, she felt everywhere at once as Agatha’s hand slipped between her legs, fingers gliding through every bit of desire that pooled there.</p><p dir="ltr">“Holy fuck, you’re so wet,” she marveled breathlessly, tracing her fingers up and down in a way that made Rio whimper and shiver.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s the you effect,” she managed, only slightly muffled by the way her cheek was pressed to the bed.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha hummed, but kept it up for only a moment longer. That was when she pressed two fingers into Rio’s core, causing her to clench automatically.</p><p dir="ltr">“Ohhh, God, Agatha.”</p><p dir="ltr">A low, deep chuckle sounded from behind her.</p><p dir="ltr">And then she realized what Agatha was doing.</p><p dir="ltr">She withdrew her fingers and moved them higher, gently pressing the tip of one against Rio’s asshole.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh god.</p><p dir="ltr">The moment it sank inside, a groan left her body and she twitched slightly in place, adjusting to the feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">“‘F’you feel like that now…” Rio panted, her hips shimmying slightly against the feeling, “can’t wait until I’m fucking stuffed with you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha apparently could not wait, either.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, she withdrew her finger and the next thing Rio heard was the cap on the bottle of lube popping open.</p><p dir="ltr">She knew that fucking harness wouldn’t go unused forever, but what a day to break it in.</p><p dir="ltr">There was little noise outside of their breathing as Agatha appropriately coated both cocks. In the next second, Rio let out a shrill and surprised cry the moment the cold lube dripped down onto her ass and seeped lower over her folds.</p><p dir="ltr">Good fucking God.</p><p dir="ltr">Would she even survive?</p><p dir="ltr">“Please, my love. I need you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Her voice was almost pathetic as she begged, causing Agatha’s breath to catch behind her. One of her hands wrapped around both of Rio’s as the other assisted her in positioning both dildoes. The bottom one – slightly longer than the top – slipped into her cunt first, but barely the head.</p><p dir="ltr">Didn’t matter.</p><p dir="ltr">The moan that came from Rio’s throat still almost rattled the windows.</p><p dir="ltr">When the top one slipped into her ass, she gripped at Agatha’s hand so tightly she was sure her nails might draw blood.</p><p dir="ltr">But Agatha didn’t seem to mind. In fact, she fucking <em>moaned</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, very slowly, she eased her way forward, both cocks sinking into Rio’s body at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy shit.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy fuck.</p><p dir="ltr">Holy <em>mother of God.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Both stretches were instant and overwhelming, leaving her feeling like a cracked open shell, but she did not want Agatha to stop.</p><p dir="ltr">Making too much noise to firm coherent words, she squeezed at Agatha’s hand to encourage her to keep going.</p><p dir="ltr">And then she felt something else.</p><p dir="ltr">Agayha did not move the hand in Rio’s hold, but instead used the other to pick the cord up off her back. She wrapped it around her fist and gave a light tug, drawing more animalistic noises straight from Rio’s chest.</p><p dir="ltr">Between the stretch and fill of her cunt and ass and the sudden pressure on her throat, Rio felt like she could simply combust. It was all pleasure, even the pain, and she wanted <em>more.</em></p><p dir="ltr">“F-faster,” she choked out.</p><p dir="ltr">And then she had an idea.</p><p dir="ltr">Using core strength, Rio lifted her torso off the bed, attempting to hold herself level as Agatha’s hold on her makeshift leash tightened.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, fuck,” Agatha rasped, working her hips a little quicker, though she was still being cautious. She was listening to the request and still managing to take care to listen to Rio’s body, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio, on the other hand, felt like she could explode from every bit of pleasure pulling her nerves taut. It was making the whole ‘hold a half-plank’ thing kind of hard.</p><p dir="ltr">But she still tried.</p><p dir="ltr">At least for two more minutes as Agatha cooed praise at her, fucking her so well and good she knew she was close to coming.</p><p dir="ltr">“Good girl, taking so much of me.”</p><p dir="ltr">“You’re so full, baby.”</p><p dir="ltr">“God, my love. Fuck. You look so good like this.”</p><p dir="ltr">It was the last one that tipped her forward, causing her face to buy in the mattress again. When Agatha gave a tug at the cord around her neck, Rio knew she was not long for the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha seemed to sense it too, her hips swinging with a little more force.</p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, fuck. Ohfuckohfuckohfuck,” Rio practically cried, already feeling the pleasure begin to pool low in her belly. “Agatha. Agatha, I’m gonna –”</p><p dir="ltr">“Come, Rio. Come for me.”</p><p dir="ltr">Access fucking granted.</p><p dir="ltr">Orgasms delivered graciously by Agatha were a dime a dozen, especially as of late.</p><p dir="ltr">What Rio felt right then as Agatha pulled on the cord and pressed down on her hands wasn’t just a fucking orgasm.</p><p dir="ltr">That shit was spiritual transcendence.</p><p dir="ltr">Her wails and moans were caught by the sheets and mattress as her body twitched and convulsed, her cunt and ass clenching on Agatha’s cocks buried inside of her.</p><p dir="ltr">For only a moment, Rio was almost certain she blacked out.</p><p dir="ltr">Mostly because when she opened her eyes, her body felt empty and Agatha was on her knees next to her, carefully untying the cords around her wrist.</p><p dir="ltr">“You okay down there?” she posed, reaching up for the one around Rio’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“College graduate <em>and </em>your certified slut? Couldn’t be better,” she wheezed, still panting.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha gave a light push to her hip, rolling her to her side, and placed herself onto the bed, leaning against the headboard. She was quick as she leaned forward, strong hands gripping beneath Rio’s arms to pull her up, holding her against her chest.</p><p dir="ltr">Easily, Rio settled and let her head drop to Agatha’s shoulder, brushing her lips over Agatha’s neck.</p><p dir="ltr">“Did you know I love you?” she managed, still a little winded and spent.</p><p dir="ltr">“Yes, I do. And <em>I</em> know that <em>you </em>know I love you.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I do know that.”</p><p dir="ltr">“And Rio?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah?</p><p dir="ltr">“I’m <em>really </em>fucking proud of you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio smiled, her cheek squished against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know that, too.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha squeezed her tighter and pressed a kiss to her forehead. “We did it,” she breathed against Rio’s skin.</p><p dir="ltr">“We did. Together.”</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha and Rio.</p><p dir="ltr">Together always.</p><p> </p>
